# Pancreatic Hormones
## Summary

The hormones insulin and glucagon are the main regulators of glucose metabolism. They are produced in the pancreatic islets, but they act oppositely: while, for example, blood sugar levels are lowered by the action of insulin, glucagon causes an increase. The hormone somatostatin is also produced in the pancreatic islets. It exerts an inhibitory effect on the secretion of insulin and glucagon and additionally inhibits the secretion of a number of other hormones.
## Insulin

The insulin produced in the pancreatic B cells is an anabolic hormone: It promotes the formation of energy reserves by facilitating the uptake of sugar from food into the cells of insulin-dependent organs (especially skeletal muscle and adipose tissue), thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Furthermore, insulin has a growth-stimulating effect.

### Insulin Metabolism

- Structure of insulin: peptide hormone consisting of an A chain with 21 and a B chain with 30 amino acids.
- Synthesis of Insulins
    - Location: B-cells of the pancreas
    - Synthesis steps: Formation of preproinsulin at the ribosomes → Post-translational modification in the rough ER → Proinsulin → Cleavage of the C-peptide by proteolysis in the Golgi apparatus → Mature insulin
    - Storage: In the complex with zinc and the cleaved C-peptide in secretory vesicles
- Transport of Insulins in the Blood: Freely soluble
- Degradation of insulin: Endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the insulin-insulin receptor complex in the target cells
### Insulin Secretion

The vesicles in which insulin is stored together with C-peptide and zinc ions are emptied via exocytosis when blood sugar levels rise.

- Process of insulin secretion: High blood sugar levels lead to insulin secretion
    1. Uptake of glucose into the B cell via the GLUT1 transporter [1]
    2. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by glucokinase
    3. Breakdown of glucose-6-phosphate via glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and electron transport chain → Intracellular ATP↑
    4. ATP binds to the ATP-dependent potassium channel, which is then inhibited.
    5. Decrease of K+-conductance → Depolarization
    6. Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
    7. Exocytosis of the vesicle

Glucose uptake via GLUT1 transporter → Glycolysis → ATP↑ → Closure of ATP-regulated K+-channels → Depolarization of the cell membrane → Opening of voltage-gated Ca2+-channels → Intracellular Ca2+↑!

- Regulation of insulin secretion: Insulin secretion is regulated by many different factors.
    - Secretagogue factors
        - Glucose
        - Amino acids (especially arginine)
        - Fatty acids
        - Enterohormone, e.g. GLP1 and GIP (gastric inhibitory peptide)
        - Parasympathicotonus↑
        - Adrenaline (β2-receptors)
    - Secretion-inhibiting factors
        - Sympathetic Tone↑
            - Norepinephrine, Epinephrine (α2-receptors)
        - Somatostatin

> [!NOTE]
> A high blood sugar level is the primary secretion stimulus for insulin!

> [!NOTE] Sulfonylureas
> Sulfonylureas (e.g., glibenclamide) can be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting the ATP-dependent potassium channels of the B cells. This causes the B cell to depolarize independently of the intracellular ATP concentration. The subsequent influx of Ca2+ ions through the activated voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels leads to the exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles. Since sulfonylureas increase insulin secretion independently of glucose, it must be noted that they can lead to potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia.

> [!NOTE] C-Peptide as a diagnostic marker
> Since exactly one insulin molecule and one C-peptide arise from each insulin precursor molecule, the C-peptide is present in equimolar amounts as insulin. Thus, the number of specific C-peptide molecules can be directly used to infer the number of insulin molecules secreted by the pancreas. This is useful, on the one hand, to quantify the residual secretion of insulin in cases of insulin deficiency due to the destruction of pancreatic B-cells, as seen in type 1 diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, it can be determined whether hypoglycemia is caused by an excess of insulin. This would be expected in the case of a B-cell tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma).

### Insulin Effect

#### Mechanism of Action

Insulin exerts its effects through the membrane-bound insulin receptor.

- Structure of the insulin receptor
    - Receptor tyrosine kinase = Tetramer of
        - Two α-subunits
        - Two β-subunits
- Process of insulin receptor activation
    1. Insulin binds to the insulin receptor and causes a conformational change.
    2. This activates the tyrosine kinase domain (β-subunit)
    3. It first phosphorylates itself (autophosphorylation) and then a series of signal transduction proteins, particularly tyrosine residues in the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)
    4. This activates intracellular signal transduction pathways:
        1. Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway and
        2. Activation of PI3-kinase → PIP3 is generated in the cell membrane → Activates protein kinase B (PKB) → cAMP↓

> [!NOTE]
> Insulin mediates its metabolic effect by lowering cAMP levels!

#### Effect on Target Organs

Insulin acts anabolically at the target organs: It stimulates metabolic pathways that replenish energy stores and inhibits metabolic pathways that break down energy stores. In this context, a distinction is made between a rapid insulin effect and a slow one.

##### Quick Effects

The rapid effects of insulin are mediated by the activation of proteins that are already present in the cells.

- Carbohydrate metabolism: Lowering blood sugar levels through the following mechanisms:
    - Increase in glucose uptake into cells: Incorporation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle and fat cells
    - Stimulation of glucose utilization
        - Glycolysis and glycogen synthesis↑
        - Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (liver)↓
- Fat metabolism: Replenishment of fat stores in fat and liver cells
    - Fatty acid synthesis and lipogenesis↑
    - Fatty acid breakdown and lipolysis↓
- Protein metabolism
    - Amino acid synthesis↑ → Protein biosynthesis↑ (especially in skeletal muscle)
- Potassium balance
    - Na+/K+-ATPase is stimulated in all cells → K+ is relocated intracellularly

> [!NOTE] Therapy for Hyperkalemia
> Insulin has the property of indirectly and glucose-independently stimulating the Na+/K+-ATPase, which results in an increased uptake of potassium into the cells. This can be therapeutically utilized in cases of hyperkalemia (too high potassium concentration in the blood), as this can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias: The administration of insulin facilitates the redistribution of the (extracellularly) elevated potassium to intracellularly – ideally normalizing the potassium levels in the blood. Conversely, however, administering too much insulin can also cause hypokalemia!

> [!NOTE]
> The administration of too much insulin can cause hypokalemia!

> [!NOTE]
> The normal values for fasting blood sugar in adults range from about 50–70 to 100 mg/dL (3.9–5.6 mmol/L). The threshold for hypoglycemia of 50 or 70 mg/dL is based on non-diabetics and is inconsistent in the literature; above 100 mg/dL, it is referred to as hyperglycemia.

##### Slow Effects

The slow effects of insulin are mediated at the transcriptional level, that is, through the induction or repression of gene products (e.g., the key enzymes of certain metabolic pathways).

- Carbohydrate metabolism
    - Increase in glucose uptake into the cells: Increased synthesis of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle and fat cells
    - Stimulation of glucose utilization
        - Glycolysis↑
        - Pentose phosphate pathway↑
        - Gluconeogenesis (Liver)↓
- Fat metabolism
    - Fatty acid synthesis↑, fat storage breakdown↓
- Protein metabolism
    - Protein synthesis↑
- Growth and differentiation processes
    - The growth-stimulating effect of insulin is likely mediated either through the IGF-1 receptor or through hybrid receptors (composed half of insulin receptor and half of IGF-1 receptor).



> [!NOTE] Diabetes mellitus
> Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by an increase in blood glucose concentration (hyperglycemia). The two main forms of this disease are Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. As glucose is subsequently excreted in greater amounts, there is an increased excretion of water (polyuria) and, consequently, increased thirst and drinking (polydipsia).
> In type 1 diabetes mellitus, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction. Since no insulin is produced at all, affected individuals must replace insulin for life. A typical characteristic of this subtype is weight loss, which is caused on one hand by increased water loss and on the other hand by the compensatory breakdown of fat stores and muscle proteins. Due to increased lipolysis, there is an enhanced formation of ketone bodies, which can lead to metabolic acidosis. Particularly in combination with volume loss, patients can experience life-threatening ketoacidotic coma.
> The more common type 2 diabetes mellitus has both a strong genetic component and a significant association with overeating. A disturbed effect of insulin on body cells (insulin resistance) and an initially compensatory increased and later reduced insulin secretion from the beta cells lead to hyperglycemia. This type of diabetes unfortunately often remains clinically undiagnosed for many years, but it already causes serious organ damage, particularly to the heart (coronary heart disease), circulatory system, kidneys (diabetic nephropathy), eyes (diabetic retinopathy), and nervous system (diabetic neuropathy with diabetic foot syndrome). Typically, a "metabolic career" precedes type 2 diabetes, which particularly increases the risk of heart and circulatory diseases (e.g., myocardial infarction). In addition to these, kidney failure is also responsible for the reduced life expectancy in all diabetic patients. Theoretically, for type 2 diabetics, weight normalization, physical activity, and a balanced diet would be sufficient to prevent the manifestation and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, this rarely succeeds, so oral antidiabetic medications and, in cases of secondary failure, insulin injections become necessary for blood sugar control (in addition to dietary instructions).

## Glucagon

The glucagon produced in the pancreatic A cells is the antagonist of insulin. It acts as a catabolic hormone, as it promotes the breakdown of energy stores in the human body and raises blood sugar levels. By causing a sufficient release of glucose from the liver, glucagon ensures a stable blood sugar level.

### Glucagon Metabolism

- Structure: Peptide hormone made up of 29 amino acids
- Synthesis
    - Precursor molecule: Preproglucagon
    - Location: A-cells of the pancreas
- Storage: In secretory vesicles (= granules)
- Secretion: Exocytosis upon decrease of blood sugar levels
    - Secretion-stimulating factors: Low blood sugar levels, high amino acid concentrations (especially arginine) in the blood
    - Secretion-inhibiting factors: Insulin, Somatostatin
- Transport in the blood: Freely soluble in blood
- Reduction
    - Liver: Proteolysis
    - Kidney: Excretion

> [!NOTE]
> The primary stimulus for glucagon secretion is a low blood sugar level!

### Effect

Glucagon mediates its catabolic effect primarily through G-protein-coupled receptors on liver cells. Its main effect is the increase of blood sugar levels.

- Mechanism of action
    - G-Protein-coupled receptor
        → Adenylate cyclase↑
        → cAMP↑  
        → Activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA)
- Effect on the target organs (Mainly liver)
    - Carbohydrate metabolism: The main task of glucagon is to increase blood sugar levels.
        - Glycogen breakdown↑
        - Glycogen synthesis↓
        - Gluconeogenesis↑
    - Fatty acid metabolism
        - Fatty acid synthesis and lipogenesis↓
        - Fatty acid breakdown and lipolysis↑
## Somatostatin

Somatostatin is the antagonist of growth hormone. It plays an important role in the negative feedback of various hormone axes, thus inhibiting the release of several other hormones and is, in a sense, a "universal stop sign." Unlike insulin and glucagon, it is produced not only in the Langerhans islets of the pancreas but also in certain cells of the stomach and intestines as well as in the hypothalamus.

- Structure: Peptide hormone made up of 14 amino acids
- Synthesis types
    - Hypothalamus
    - D-cells from pancreas, gastric antrum, and intestine
- Effect: Inhibits the production of many hormones (e.g., GH, TSH, glucagon, insulin, gastrin, histamine)

> [!NOTE]
> Somatostatin only inhibits hormone production in many endocrine cells and organs!

> [!NOTE] Somatostatin analogs
> Many cells have somatostatin receptors on their surface. This provides a target for the treatment of tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system with medications whose active ingredient is structurally similar to somatostatin – the so-called somatostatin analogs. This group of medications can also be used for the treatment of so-called acromegaly, in which an excess of somatotropin leads to excessive growth of the body parts removed from the trunk (= acral).

### Effect on Target Cells

- Adenohypophysis: GH↓, TSH↓
- Pancreas
    - Exocrine: Pancreatic enzymes↓ , HCO3-↓
    - Endocrine: Glucagon↓, Insulin↓
- Stomach
    - G-cells: Gastrin↓ → HCl↓
    - ECL cells: Histamine↓
- Intestine: Decreased motility
## Review Questions on the Chapter Pancreatic Hormones
### Insulin

What precursors and where in the cell does the biosynthesis of insulin take place?
- In insulin biosynthesis, preproinsulin is first synthesized at the ribosomes of the rough ER. The signal peptide is cleaved co-translationally, resulting in proinsulin. Mature insulin is finally formed after the cleavage of the C-peptide.
Name the individual steps that lead to insulin secretion in the B-cells of the pancreas.
- Insulin secretion by the B-cells of the pancreas proceeds as follows: 1. Glucose uptake via GLUT1 transporter, 2. Metabolization of glucose and increase in ATP concentration, 3. Closing of ATP-dependent potassium channels in the cell membrane, 4. Depolarization of the B-cell, 5. Opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels and increase in calcium concentration, 6. Exocytosis of the vesicles in which the mature insulin is stored.
What is the most important stimulus for insulin secretion and how is it regulated?
- The most important stimulus for insulin secretion is a high blood glucose level. The release of insulin is enhanced by short-term increased concentrations of amino acids and fatty acids, entero-hormones, and increased parasympathetic tone. Insulin secretion is inhibited by adrenaline and noradrenaline as well as somatostatin.
To which type of receptors does the insulin receptor belong?
- The insulin receptor is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinases.
Describe the signaling cascade triggered by the binding of insulin to its receptor.
- Binding of insulin to its receptor causes a conformational change of the receptor and leads to autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and other target proteins (including insulin receptor substrate). Via the small G-protein Ras, the growth-stimulating MAPK cascade is activated. Additionally, PI3 kinase is activated, which phosphorylates PIP2 in the cell membrane to PIP3, which ultimately unleashes the metabolic effects of insulin via activation of protein kinase B.
What effect does insulin have on carbohydrate metabolism?
- Insulin causes a decrease in blood glucose levels by increased uptake of glucose into skeletal muscle and fat cells. On the one hand, already present GLUT4 molecules are translocated into the cell membrane (fast effect), on the other hand, their biosynthesis is increased (slow effect). Additionally, glucose utilization is enhanced, including increased glycolysis and glycogen synthesis, and glucose synthesis is inhibited.
What effect does insulin have on fat metabolism?
- Insulin lowers the potassium level in the blood by stimulating the Na+/K+-ATPase, so that increased potassium is taken up into the cells.
What effect does insulin have on potassium balance?
- Insulin lowers the potassium level in the blood by stimulating the Na+/K+-ATPase, so that increased potassium is taken up into the cells.
What fasting blood sugar concentrations are referred to as hypoglycemia, and which are referred to as hyperglycemia?
- In adults, a fasting blood glucose concentration below 50 to 70 mg/dL is referred to as hypoglycemia; values above 100 mg/dL are referred to as hyperglycemia.
Why can oral antidiabetic medications from the group of sulfonylureas sometimes lead to severe hypoglycemia?
- Sulfonylureas cause glucose-independent release of insulin and can therefore cause hypoglycemia as a side effect.
Which enzyme is responsible for keeping glucose taken up by the B cells of the pancreas inside the cell?
- After uptake into the B cells via the GLUT1 transporter, glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase (= isoenzyme of hexokinase) to glucose-6-phosphate and thus fixed intracellularly.
### Glucagon

Describe the signaling cascade triggered by the binding of glucagon to its receptor.
- Glucagon binds to its G protein-coupled receptor on hepatocytes, which leads to activation of intracellular adenylate cyclase. Consequently, the concentration of cyclic AMP increases, which in turn activates protein kinase A. This activates (via various mechanisms such as phosphorylation, increased expression of enzymes) glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis and inhibits the enzymes of glycogen synthesis.
### Somatostatin

Where is somatostatin synthesized?
- Somatostatin is synthesized not only in the D-cells of the pancreas, intestine, and gastric antrum but also in the hypothalamus.
What effect does somatostatin have on the pancreas and what effect does it have on the stomach?
- Somatostatin has an inhibitory effect on the endocrine and exocrine portion of the pancreas and also inhibits gastric acid production.
