# Muscle Tissue
## Summary

The uniqueness of muscle tissue is its ability to generate force and move body parts. This is made possible by the contractile myofilaments actin and myosin, which can slide against each other. Based on the intracellular arrangement of these myofilaments, muscle tissue is divided into striated (skeletal and cardiac muscle) and smooth muscle (e.g., in the intestine). The molecular interaction of the contractile filaments differs little among the various muscle types (sliding filament theory), whereas their function varies greatly.

#### Structural Characteristics of a Muscle Cell

- Contractility: Through the interaction of so-called myofilaments made of actin and myosin, muscle cells can generate tension or shorten.
- Calcium storage: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) serves as a calcium storage (needed for contraction) and is variably expanded to so-called L-tubules and terminal cisternae.
- Invaginations of the sarcolemma: The sarcolemma has deep membrane channels extending into the cell in striated muscle (so-called T-tubules) or membrane invaginations in smooth muscle (caveolae)

## Myofilaments

### Structure of Myofilaments

The force of both smooth and striated muscle cells is always generated by the sliding of actin against myosin. In order to control the activity of these myofilaments, specialized proteins prevent their free interaction. Only during contraction are these regulatory proteins altered by calcium so that actin and myosin can interact.

#### Actin filaments

- Synonym: Thin filaments
- Function: Actin filaments form the scaffold along which the myosin filaments slide in an ATP-dependent manner.
- Stabilization: Regulatory proteins such as nebulin and tropomyosin accompany the actin along its entire length and prevent its depolymerization.
- Chaperone proteins for
    - Blocking of myosin binding sites: Tropomyosin (in striated and smooth muscle), Caldesmon and Calponin (both only in smooth muscle)
    - Interaction with calcium: Troponin (in striated muscle) and calmodulin (in smooth muscle)

#### Myosin filaments

- Synonym: Thick filaments
- Function: Gliding along actin filaments with ATP consumption
- Construction
    - The myosin filament consists of about 300 myosin molecules
    - The myosin molecule consists of a tail and a head, which are formed from several heavy and light chains depending on the type of myosin.
        - Myosin heads have both affinity for actin and ATPase activity.
        - Heavy chains are wrapped around each other like a braid, with myosin heads protruding on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the striated and smooth muscle cells always mediate their contraction through actin and myosin! G-actin is "globular" and assembles like pearls on a string into a so-called actin(!) filament (hence called F-actin)!

> [!NOTE] Cardiac Troponin in Myocardial Infarction:
> The precise structure of the proteins in the troponin complex (see below) differs slightly between cardiac and skeletal muscle. This is utilized in the context of heart attack diagnostics. If a patient feels tightness in the chest, it is often due to either a relative or absolute oxygen deficiency in the heart muscle cells (e.g., during a heart attack). In a heart attack, heart muscle cells are damaged due to absolute oxygen deprivation and release their cellular content into the blood. Therefore, the increase of cardiac troponin in the blood indicates the destruction of heart muscle tissue and thus points to a heart attack.

### Arrangement of Myofilaments

In striated muscle cells (heart and skeletal muscle), the myofilaments actin and myosin are arranged in many small and similarly structured organizational units. Each of these units is referred to as a sarcomere. Within a striated muscle cell, a multitude of these sarcomeres are present in chains lined up one after the other. The force developed by the sarcomeres is transmitted through intermediate filaments such as dystrophin to the sarcolemma and ultimately to the muscle tendon. In smooth muscle, the myofilaments are not arranged in structures like sarcomeres, but are more or less "disordered" within the muscle cell.

#### Types of Orders

- Smooth Muscle: "Disorganized"
- Striated Muscle: Sarcomeres

#### Sarcomeres of Striated Muscle

- Definition: Smallest functional unit of the myofilaments of striated muscle.
- Components
    - Bands
        - I-band: Area where only actin filaments are located
        - A-Band: Consists of three individual sections
            - (Darker) Outer sections: Parallel alignment of actin and myosin filaments with heads
            - (Hellerer) Central section (so-called H-zone): Parallel alignment of myosin filaments, which do not form heads here and are attached at the center to the so-called M-line.
    - Stripes
        - Z-disks: Separate one sarcomere from the next on both sides and serve as an anchorage for the actin filaments (via anchoring proteins, such as α-actinin)
        - M-line: center of the H-zone, where oppositely oriented myosin filaments are attached.
- Anchors
    - Crosslinking of the Z-discs (of the sarcomeres) and anchoring of the same in the sarcolemma: Intermediate filaments (mainly desmin)
    - Connection of (non-contractile) actin of the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular matrix: Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
    - Anchoring of the muscle cell in the endomysium using collagen fibrils
- Arrangement: Sarcomere chains, separated by Z-lines

> [!NOTE]
> The regular arrangement of single (isotropic: I-band) and double-refracting (anisotropic: A-band) bands creates the light-microscopic impression of a cross-striation!

> [!NOTE]
> Between the M- and Z-stripes of a sarcomere in striated muscle, the protein titin is taut. It is elastic and acts like a spring to return the sarcomere to its original state after stretching. Thus, it limits the passive extensibility of a muscle and protects against damage!

> [!NOTE]
> During the contraction of a muscle cell, the contractile filaments slide past each other, thereby shortening the sarcomere. The length of the filaments remains unchanged!

> [!NOTE] Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
> Skeletal and cardiac muscle cells contain a large amount of the structural protein dystrophin, which connects the cytoskeleton (to which the contractile filaments are attached) with the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix. The exact function of the various proteins in the dystrophin complex is still unknown; however, this connection is needed on one hand for the transmission of force and on the other hand for the stabilization of the muscle cell. If this dystrophin complex is not fully functional (as in the case of muscular dystrophies type Becker and type Duchenne), it leads to an increasing loss of strength and degeneration of the striated muscle. The less functional dystrophin is present, the earlier and more severely muscle weakness manifests.

## Contraction of Myofilaments

### Mechanisms for Triggering a Contraction Cycle

- Goal: Transfer of electrical or chemical information to the contractile filaments for the initiation of a contraction
- Conditions
    1. Triggering stimulus
    2. High intracellular calcium levels, so that actin and myosin can interact.
- Basic process of electro-/pharmaco-mechanical coupling
    - Initial state: Actin and myosin cannot interact.
    - Trigger stimulus depolarizes sarcolemma
    - Electrical stimulus spreads over the sarcolemma → Invaginations of the sarcolemma (T-tubules or caveolae) bring the stimulus close to intracellular structures
    - Opening of calcium channels in the sarcolemma and in the sarcoplasmic reticulum → Increase in intracellular calcium concentration
    - Myosin binding sites are freed → Interaction of actin and myosin (see: filament sliding theory) → Mechanical contraction

### Basic Process of a Contraction Cycle (Sliding Filament Theory)

When a muscle cell is stimulated by an electrical or chemical stimulus, an electrical excitation spreads across the sarcolemma. The translation of the electrical stimulus into a mechanical contraction is called electromechanical coupling and is based on the sliding of the two contractile filaments, actin and myosin, against each other. How these filaments interact with each other on a molecular level to trigger muscle movement is described by the so-called sliding filament theory.

- Function: Force generation by the sliding of myosin and actin past each other; in this process, only the sarcomere shortens.
- Contraction conditions: Sufficient ATP and high intracellular calcium concentration
- Process
    - Resting state: Actin and myosin cannot interact with each other as they are inhibited by accompanying proteins (e.g., tropomyosin).
    - Contraction Cycle
        1. Raising the myosin head
            - Splitting of ATP by myosin ATPase into ADP and P (both remain on the myosin head) → Myosin head changes its conformation (becomes "pre-tensioned"), but does not yet interact with actin
        2. Formation of bridging arches
            - Activation of the muscle cell (e.g., chemically, electrically) leads to increased intracellular calcium concentration (see: Electromechanical coupling in skeletal muscle) → Binding of calcium to the accompanying proteins.
            - Conformational change of the accompanying proteins → Myosin binding sites are exposed
            - Myosin binds to released actin at a 90° angle.
        3. Power stroke of the myosin head
            - ADP and P are released from the myosin head → Bending of the myosin head by 45°
            - Myosin filaments pull actin filaments along by bending (so-called power stroke) → shortening of the sarcomeres
        4. Solving the cross braces
            - Binding of a new ATP to the empty binding site of the myosin head → conformational change
            - Dissociation of the cross-bridges between myosin and actin through ATP binding
        5. Repetition of the cycle
            - As long as the calcium concentration in the muscle cell remains elevated, the cross-bridge cycle can run again.
            - Depending on the ATPase activity (ATP cleavage rate per unit of time) of the heavy myosin chain, about 10-100 crossbridge cycles per second are possible.
            - The more cross-bridge cycles/unit of time can occur, the faster and stronger the muscle contraction.
    - Rest position: Renewal of the contraction cycle possible

> [!NOTE] Rigor mortis
> To dissolve the cross-bridges between the muscle filaments myosin and actin, ATP is required. When a person dies, no further ATP is produced in their cells, which means that actin and myosin can no longer be separated. The muscles become stiff, a phenomenon known as rigor mortis. The stiffness typically first occurs in the muscles that were last used.

## Providing Energy for Contraction

The musculature continuously requires energy to maintain both its structure and its ion gradients, and to enable the contraction of the myofilaments actin and myosin. Without this energy in the form of ATP, the myofilaments cannot separate from each other, and the muscle becomes rigid. ATP is primarily generated in skeletal muscle from the metabolism of glucose (glycolysis) and fatty acids (β-oxidation). The metabolic products of these processes are then utilized in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain for the oxidative production of ATP.

If the intensity of the load is significantly increased in the short term (for example, during a short sprint from a standing start), the energy consumption of the muscles also increases so sharply in the short term that mechanisms to bridge this high energy demand come into play: On one hand, anaerobic glycolysis provides energy from muscle glycogen, and on the other hand, enzymes like creatine kinase and myokinase temporarily produce ATP from energy-rich compounds such as phosphocreatine (creatine kinase) or from two molecules of ADP (myokinase). Therefore, phosphocreatine represents another energy-rich compound for muscle contraction alongside ATP. However, both the stores of ATP and those of phosphocreatine are limited. For prolonged exertion, energy from aerobic cellular respiration must then be relied upon.

Details on myocardial metabolism and the metabolism of skeletal muscle are presented in exercise physiology (see: exercise physiology and aging).

### Phosphocreatine Metabolism

#### Creatine Synthesis

- 1. Step: In the kidney
    - Reaction: Arginine + Glycine → Ornithine + Guanidinoacetate
    - Enzyme: Arginine-Glycine-Amidinotransferase
- Step 2: In the liver
    - Reaction: Methylation of guanidinoacetate to creatine
    - Enzyme: Guanidinoacetate Methyltransferase (Cofactor: S-Adenosylmethionine)

#### Creatine Kinase

- Definition: Enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine and ATP to phosphocreatine (= creatine phosphate) as well as the reverse reaction.
- Catalyzed reaction: Creatine + ATP ↔︎ Phosphocreatine + ADP

> [!NOTE]
> Phosphocreatine is an important short-term energy store in the muscle cell in addition to the ATP supply!

#### Breakdown of Creatine

- Phosphocreatine is non-enzymatically converted into creatinine by the cleavage of the phosphate group and cyclization.
- Excretion with urine

### Myokinase (= Adenylate kinase)

- Definition: Enzyme of the intermembrane space of the mitochondria that transfers a phosphate group from one ADP to another ADP, thereby providing ATP.
- Catalyzed reaction: ADP+ADP ↔︎ ATP+AMP

### Glucose-Alanine Cycle

- Definition: Metabolic cycle in which skeletal muscle transports toxic ammonia from protein breakdown to the liver and receives glucose in exchange for energy production.
- Most important enzyme: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
- Process
    1. During the breakdown of muscle proteins, a lot of alanine is released.
    2. This is transported via the blood to the liver and there deaminated to pyruvate with the help of alanine aminotransferase.
    3. Pyruvate can now be introduced into gluconeogenesis, thus being converted into glucose, which is then released into the blood and transported to the muscle.
    4. There, glucose can be broken down for energy.

> [!NOTE]
> Since gluconeogenesis consumes more energy than glycolysis provides, the glucose-alanine cycle costs energy! Therefore, in thermodynamic terms, it does not serve the energy production of the organism, but rather to supply glucose to the muscles!

### Cori Cycle

- Definition: Metabolic cycle in which lactate produced in skeletal muscle is converted back to glucose in the liver, which is then used by the skeletal muscle for energy production.
- Most important enzyme: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
- Process
    1. In case of oxygen deficiency in active skeletal muscle, LDH catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis).
    2. Lactate is transported through the blood to the liver, where it is oxidized to pyruvate again by the activity of LDH.
    3. Pyruvate serves as a substrate for gluconeogenesis: It is converted into glucose and transported to the muscle via the bloodstream.
    4. Glucose serves to further energy production in skeletal muscle.

## Comparison of the different muscle tissues

When comparing striated and smooth muscle, many structural and functional similarities can be found. However, there are crucial differences in both the structure and function of the various types of muscle tissue. This section will explicitly present only these differences.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Muscle Tissue
### Myofilaments

Which proteins prevent the binding of actin and myosin in skeletal muscle?
- Troponin and tropomyosin prevent the binding of actin and myosin in skeletal muscle. Tropomyosin is an accessory protein arranged as a filament around the actin filament and blocks the binding sites for the myosin heads. When the sarcoplasmic calcium concentration rises, calcium binds to troponin (a regulatory protein of the actin filament), causing tropomyosin to release the contact sites for the myosin heads. Only then can the cross-bridge cycle begin.

Which muscle protein behaves elastically (similar to a mechanical spring)?
- The muscle protein titin is located between the M- and Z-lines of a sarcomere in striated muscle and has elastic properties. It is a relatively large protein made of almost 30,000 amino acids that fold into different domains. They unfold and fold depending on whether tensile stress acts on them—similar to a mechanical spring. This brings the sarcomere back to its original state after stretching and also limits the passive extensibility of a muscle.

What is the main composition of the membrane skeleton of a skeletal muscle fiber?
- The membrane skeleton of a skeletal muscle fiber mainly consists of dystrophin. Dystrophins arrange themselves with other proteins (e.g., spectrins) into a two-dimensional network beneath the cell membrane and are linked there to form the membrane skeleton. This serves, among other things, to stabilize the muscle cell membrane and to transmit force from myofibrils to the muscle cell.

What is the function of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex in skeletal muscle?
- The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex serves to connect cortical—i.e., located directly beneath the cell membrane—actin of the cytoskeleton with the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix. Unlike the centrally located actin filaments in the muscle cell, cortical actin is not contractile.

What function does α-actinin have in skeletal muscle?
- In skeletal muscle, the protein α-actinin anchors the actin filaments in the Z-disc; thus, it is a component of the sarcomere.

What role do actin filaments play in skeletal muscle?
- In skeletal muscle, actin filaments interact with myosin via regulatory proteins. During the cross-bridge cycle, the myosin head binds to an actin filament (so-called cross-bridge formation), which after the release of phosphate bound to the myosin head leads to the power stroke of the myosin head. The myosin head then moves along the actin filament.

### Contraction of myofilaments

What does the binding of ATP to myosin lead to in the context of the crossbridge cycle?
- In the context of the cross-bridge cycle (sliding filament theory), the detachment of the myosin head from actin (i.e., the interruption of cross-bridge formation) marks the end of a contraction cycle. This is mediated by the binding of a new ATP molecule to the free binding site of the myosin head after the previously bound ADP and phosphate were released during the power stroke (shortening of the muscle filaments).

How long does a transverse bridge cycle take approximately, and what does the duration of a cycle depend on?
- For initiating the cross-bridge cycle, calcium must be present. Its duration of 10–100 ms depends on the ATPase activity (amount of hydrolytically cleaved ATP per unit time) of the heavy myosin chain in striated muscle. The higher the repetition rate of the cycles, the faster the contraction progresses and the greater the contraction force.

What role does calcium play in the contraction of striated muscle?
- Calcium (Ca2+) triggers the release of the myosin binding sites on actin. Before Ca2+ binds there, the myosin binding sites on actin are blocked by tropomyosin. When Ca2+ binds to its accessory protein troponin (especially troponin C), its conformation changes, causing tropomyosin to be displaced from the myosin binding sites on actin. Only then is the start of the so-called cross-bridge cycle possible.

### Provision of energy for contraction

What options for short-term energy production does skeletal muscle utilize?
- Under short-term increased load, creatine kinase can convert the substrates phosphocreatine and ADP into the products ATP and creatine. Likewise, myokinase can form one molecule of ATP and AMP from two molecules of ADP. Additionally, anaerobic glycolysis can provide energy in the form of ATP short term through the breakdown of muscle glycogen stores.

How is creatine synthesized? How does its breakdown occur?
- Creatine is formed in two steps. First, in the kidney, the following reaction is enzymatically catalyzed: arginine + glycine → ornithine + guanidinoacetate. The guanidinoacetate formed is then enzymatically methylated to creatine in the liver. Creatine can now be converted into the energy-rich phosphocreatine via creatine kinase. The breakdown of phosphocreatine occurs non-enzymatically by releasing a phosphate group and subsequent ring formation to creatinine, which is excreted with urine.

What connection can you establish between the glucose-alanine cycle and the Cori cycle?
- In both the glucose-alanine cycle and the Cori cycle, pyruvate is produced, which is used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. The resulting glucose can be supplied back to the muscle tissue. In the glucose-alanine cycle, the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the liver deaminates alanine released from protein breakdown in skeletal muscle to pyruvate. In the Cori cycle, however, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) oxidizes anaerobically produced lactate in the muscle to pyruvate.

### Comparison of the different muscle tissues

Which protein blocks the myosin binding sites in smooth muscle cells? Which one in striated muscle?
- In smooth muscle cells, the binding of tropomyosin, caldesmon, and calponin prevents the interaction of actin with myosin and thus contraction.
- In striated muscle, however, contraction is prevented solely by the binding of tropomyosin to the myosin binding sites on actin.
