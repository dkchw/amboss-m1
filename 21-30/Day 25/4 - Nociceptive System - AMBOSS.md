# Nociceptive System
## Summary

The pain is a vital sensory perception that warns the body of dangers and injuries. The subjective severity of pain does not correlate with the extent of tissue damage, but with central processing. The sensors that perceive pain stimuli (nociceptors) are free nerve endings and are located in almost every tissue of the body. They respond to noxious mechanical stimuli, noxious thermal stimuli, and chemical substances that are released during tissue injuries and inflammations. There are also descending pathways for endogenous pain inhibition (pain modulation).

A pharmacological pain therapy is possible on different levels, which is why analgesics (pain medications) can be divided into two main groups. There are opioids, which primarily act directly in the CNS, and there are non-opioid analgesics, which exert their effects largely (but not exclusively) peripherally.
## Noziception (Pain Perception)

The nociception is the perception of stimuli that can potentially or actually harm the body. These stimuli are registered by nociceptors and transmitted to the brain via afferent pain fibers. The sensory perception of "pain" only arises through processing in the cortex.

### Noziception at the sensory level

The pain-receptive sensors are called nociceptors. These free nerve endings are mainly located in the skin, but also in almost every other tissue and can respond to chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli.

#### Nociceptors

- Definition: Primary sensory cells with free nerve endings that respond to (potentially) harmful stimuli.
- Localization: Almost in every tissue
    - Highest density in the skin
    - No nociceptors in the brain and in parenchymal organs
- Classification: Depending on their sensitivity to certain stimuli
    - Mechanosensitive nociceptors: Respond to mechanical stimuli
    - Thermosensitive nociceptors: Respond to extreme thermal stimuli (heat >45°C or cold <5°C)
        - Cold and warm sensors are present in the skin in varying densities
            - Highest density at cold points in the face, lowest density at the acral sites
    - Polymodal nociceptors: Respond to thermal (heat >42°C or cold <15°C), mechanical, and chemical stimuli.
- Adaptation behavior: Nociceptors are proportional sensors, meaning they do not adapt to prolonged, constant pain stimuli.

> [!NOTE]
> Polymodal nociceptors respond non-selectively to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli!

##### Receptors of Pain Perception

The nociceptors have various receptors that serve to register thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli. Their activation leads either directly (ionotropic mechanisms) or via intracellular signaling cascades (metabotropic mechanisms) to a change in membrane conductivity and to a depolarization.

> [!NOTE] Congenital insensitivity to pain
> Congenital insensitivity to pain is an extremely rare syndrome that is based on a mutation of the NGF-gene (nerve growth factor). Normally, NGF binds to a specific tyrosine kinase A receptor (TrkA) and thus leads to the formation of nociceptors during prenatal development. If this does not occur, no pain fibers are formed. Due to the insensitivity to pain, serious burns or other injuries often occur. The condition becomes apparent in the first year of life.

##### Nociceptive Afferents

The afferent fibers consist mainly of slowly conducting C fibers and a few, faster conducting Aδ fibers. Depending on which fibers are stimulated, a first fast ("early pain") and a second delayed pain ("late pain") can be distinguished.

### Pain Referral

The ascending nociceptive pathways are responsible for pain sensation and, like all other somatosensory pathways, consist of three neurons. In addition, there can be many modulating interneurons that are not counted individually. The pain transmission from the head region differs in its circuitry at the brainstem level from that of the rest of the body.

#### Ascending nociceptive pathways

The cell body of the first neuron of the pain pathway is located in the spinal ganglion. From here, the fibers extend into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and after a crossing continue to the thalamus. From the thalamus, they reach the somatosensory cortex and the limbic system.

##### Coupling and Transmitter

The connection to the next neuron occurs either directly or via inhibitory interneurons.

- Excitatory transmitter of the nociceptors: glutamate (with its cotransmitters substance P and CGRP)
    - Mechanism of action: Activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane → Pain transmission
- Inhibitory transmitter of interneurons: GABA and endogenous opioids (=endorphins)
    - Mechanism of action: Activation of opioid receptors at the pre- and postsynaptic membrane → Pain inhibition

## Pain Modulation

The pain modulation occurs either through a reduction (descending inhibition) or through an enhancement (peripheral and central sensitization) of the pain perception. Pain inhibition is mediated through descending pathways. The pain sensitization occurs, on one hand, through peripheral mechanisms that act directly on the nociceptors and, on the other hand, through central mechanisms that alter central nociceptive structures, leading to an increased pain perception.

### Descending nociceptive pathways (pain inhibition)

The subjective pain perception often does not correlate with the stimulus intensity. The causes of this are endogenous opioids and modulating descending pathways (= descending inhibition). The inhibition is constantly active and is further upregulated in stressful situations.

> [!NOTE] Stress analgesia
> The body's own opioids and the direct pain-inhibiting fibers provide a constantly active endogenous pain inhibition. In stressful situations (e.g., after an accident), this endogenous pain inhibition is further heightened, so that pain is initially not felt or only perceived in a weakened form (so-called "stress analgesia").

> [!NOTE] Synthetic Opioids
> The primary area of application for synthetic opioids is pain therapy, although there may also be other indications (e.g., as cough suppressants). Just like endogenous opioids, they exert their effects through the so-called opioid receptors, which operate via inhibitory G-proteins. There are three types of opioid receptors (μ-, δ-, and κ-receptors) that bind opioids with varying affinities and have various additional (side) effects beyond analgesia. The receptors are primarily found in the central nervous system, but also in peripheral tissues (e.g., intestines). The different opioid analgesics are distinguished by their pain-relieving effects (low- and high-potency opioids). Important side effects of opioids may include, for example, respiratory depression, constipation, or (severe) dependence.

### Pain Sensitization

#### Peripheral Sensitization

Substances released from damaged tissue sensitize the nociceptors or activate "sleeping" nociceptors, so that even very light stimuli trigger pain. Damaged tissue is therefore more sensitive and pain-sensitive than healthy tissue. Additionally, damaged or activated pain fibers produce neuropeptides that promote inflammation and also lead to a sensitization of the tissue.

> [!NOTE] Sunburn
> In the case of a sunburn, there is an acute inflammatory reaction of the skin. Consequently, inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, or histamine are released, leading to peripheral sensitization of the nociceptors. As a result, even light touches on the affected skin area trigger a pain sensation.

#### Central Awareness

The following mechanisms can - especially in combination - lead to a sensitization of the central pain system.

- Synaptic changes: For example, through an increased release of glutamate (pain-transmitting transmitter) in the spinal cord or brain due to tissue injury.
- Altered excitability of nociceptive neurons: Altered membrane properties and thus increased excitability of postsynaptic nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord or brain, for example, due to persistent, inadequately treated pain.
- Genetic changes in nociceptive neurons: Phenotypic changes in the genes responsible for the development of pain receptors (leading to, for example, increased excitability of the receptors)
- Restructuring of the neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord: Nerve fibers, which are excited by touch, for example, can form synapses with nociceptive neurons → even light touches can trigger pain.

> [!NOTE] Primary and secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia
> Triggering even minor pain events leads to a significantly increased pain perception, which is referred to as hyperalgesia. Primary hyperalgesia describes an increased pain sensitivity directly at the site of injury or disease and arises from peripheral sensitization. If the increased pain sensitivity also occurs in adjacent healthy areas, it is referred to as secondary hyperalgesia, which is primarily based on central sensitization. Conversely, if pain sensations occur even with simple, normally non-painful touches, it is referred to as allodynia. Allodynia usually arises from central sensitization, primarily as a result of synapse formation between touch sensors and nociceptors. In the worst case, even wearing clothing can trigger a pain sensation.

## Pain Forms

When classifying pain, it is necessary to differentiate between the various sources. Additionally, pain can be categorized based on its duration.

### Distinction based on the Place of Origin

The origin of pain can be found in the skin (= somatic surface pain), the muscles, joints, bones or the connective tissue (= somatic deep pain) as well as in the internal organs (= visceral pain). Additionally, there is the neuropathic pain, which is caused by direct damage to a nerve. Depending on the respective afferent transmission, early and/or late pain may occur.

### Distinction Based on the Duration of Pain

- Acute vs. chronic pain
    - Acute pain: Reaction that protects the organism from harm
    - Chronic pain: The protective function of pain recedes into the background
        - Temporal limitation not foreseeable
        - Lasts longer than three months
        - Represents an independent clinical picture
        - The back is the most common location for chronic pain
        - Can also occur without detectable tissue damage.

### Special Pain Types

#### Projected Pain

In the case of mechanical irritation of peripheral nerves, the subjective pain perception is always projected into the area supplied by the affected nerve. It cannot be identified at which point along its course the nerve was irritated.

- Example: Irritation of the N. ulnaris
    - Stimulus: Mechanical impact on the ulnar nerve at the elbow ("funny bone")
    - Pain localization: Little finger and half of the ring finger
    - Reason: The innervation area of the ulnar nerve lies in these fingers.

> [!NOTE] Disc herniation 
> In the case of a herniated disc, the protruding intervertebral disc irritates the spinal root. The pain arises in the innervation area of the corresponding spinal nerve (dermatome). For example, a herniated disc at the L4/L5 level (the most common location) leads to pain in the area of the lateral upper and lower leg as well as in the dorsum of the foot.

#### Transferred Pain

- Synonym: Referred pain (engl. „referred pain“)
- Anatomical/Physiological Background: Viscerocutaneous Reflex Arc
    - Different pain nerve fibers terminate on the same neurons of the spinal cord → Nerve fibers for visceral pain from internal organs converge at the level of the spinal cord dorsal horn with nerve fibers for somatic pain from various dermatomes → From there, a common relay towards the central nervous system → Strict assignment of pain origin and pain perception is lost
- Clinical manifestation
    - Head's Zone: Transmission of pain from an organ to a specific, well-defined skin area (Dermatom)
    - Mackenzie-Zone: Pain transmission to the muscles innervated by the corresponding spinal cord segment musculature (myotome)

|Overview Head's Zones|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Organ|Dermatom|Projection|
|Diaphragm|C4|Shoulder|
|Heart|Th3-4|Left Thorax|
|Esophagus|Th4-5|Retrosternal|
|Magen|Th6-7|Epigastrium|
|Liver, Gallbladder|Th10-L1|Right upper abdomen|
|Small intestine|Th10-L1|Paraumbilical|
|Colon|Th11-L1|Lower abdomen|
|Bladder|Th11-L1|Suprapubic|
|Kidneys, Testes|Th10-L1|Groin|

#### Phantom sensations

Phantom sensations are an important and common complication after amputations.

- Definition
    - Phantom pain: Pain sensation in an amputated limb
        - Pain quality: Intermittent pain that can have various qualities, e.g., burning, tingling, itching, squeezing
    - Phantom sensation: Sensation that a limb is still completely or partially present
- Cause: "Learning of pain" through sensitization of nociceptive structures in peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal structures → Hyperexcitability at glutamatergic NMDA receptors

> [!NOTE] Recording subjective pain sensations  
> Using various scales, subjective pain sensations can be quantified and compared over the course of an illness. The visual analog scale typically consists of a line on which patients can mark a point that is "analogous" to the intensity of their pain. In contrast, the numerical rating scale provides numerical values instead.
> 
> If the subjective pain perception is to be assessed with regard to the dimensions of pain (e.g., pain character, pain intensity, emotional component), a pain-related adjective list such as the McGill Pain Questionnaire is suitable. For the additional assessment of psychosocial concomitants of chronic pain, the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) is appropriate. It takes into account, among other things, the subjective pain intensity, affective disturbance, and experienced social restriction.

### Pain Components

Pain can be described based on various components.

- Sensory-discriminative component: Conscious perception of quality, localization, intensity, duration, and frequency of pain.
- Affective component: Emotional assessment of pain ("agonizing," "unbearable")
- Cognitive-evaluative component: Interpretation and reinterpretation of pain
- Vegetative Component: Vegetative physical accompanying symptoms of pain
- Motor component: Reactions to pain that are mediated by the musculature
## Review Questions on the Chapter Nociceptive System
### Noziception (Pain Perception)

Where are the cell bodies of the nociceptors located?
- The cell bodies of the nociceptors are located in the spinal ganglia.
Where is the cell body of the 2nd neuron of the pain pathway?
- The cell body of the 2nd neuron of the pain pathway is located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
Which is the excitatory neurotransmitter of the nociceptors and which channels does it act on?
- The excitatory neurotransmitter of the nociceptors is glutamate. It activates AMPA and NMDA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane.
What are the so-called TRPV channels and what activates them, among other things?
- TRPV channels are non-selective ion channels that are, among others, located on the nociceptors and are activated there by capsaicin, noxious heat, and acidosis.
For what are the TRPV channels permeable in their activated state?
- The TRPV channels are permeable to calcium, potassium, and sodium after their activation.
Which thalamic nucleus is particularly responsible for the conscious perception of pain?
- The conscious perception of pain occurs especially in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus and thus in the lateral system of the pain pathway.
What function does the anterior cingulate cortex have in pain perception?
- The anterior cingulate cortex (anterior part of the cingulate gyrus) is part of the limbic system. Here the affective component of pain arises, i.e. pain is given a subjective meaning.
To which group do the endorphins belong among the neurotransmitters?
- Endorphins belong to the neuropeptides.
### Pain Modulation

Which substances belong to the pain mediators?
- Pain mediators include, among others, histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, potassium, protons as well as some prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
What function do pain mediators have?
- Pain mediators are released from inflamed or injured tissue. They lower the activation threshold of nociceptors and sensitize them or activate "sleeping" nociceptors.
What function do neuropeptides serve in pain perception and what is the most important substance in this class?
- Neuropeptides are released as transmitters from damaged or activated nociceptors and lead to sensitization of neighboring nociceptors as well as to a neurogenic inflammatory reaction. The most important example is Substance P.
Through which fibers is the so-called axon reflex transmitted further?
- The axon reflex is transmitted via C fibers.
In which tissues and through which mechanism do both endogenous and synthetic opioids exert their effects?
- Both endogenous and synthetic opioids bind to opioid receptors, which are mainly found in the central nervous system but also in peripheral tissues (e.g., intestines). Binding activates an inhibitory G protein that triggers a signaling cascade, ultimately resulting in reduced glutamate release. This leads, among other things, to inhibition of glutamatergic pain transmission.
Which nuclei in the brainstem are responsible for pain inhibition (descending nociceptive pathways)?
- In the brainstem, the raphe magnus nucleus and the locus coeruleus play an important role in endogenous pain inhibition.
### Pain Types

What is the physiological explanation for the typical pain in the left arm during a heart attack?
- Pain in the left arm during a heart attack is an example of so-called "referred pain," which is based on the viscerocutaneous reflex arc. Here, different pain nerve fibers end on the same neurons of the spinal cord, so that nerve fibers for visceral pain from internal organs converge with nerve fibers for somatic pain from different dermatomes. Visceral pain from an organ can thus lead to pain in a certain skin area.
What does the "projected pain" describe?
- Projected pain describes that in mechanical irritation of peripheral nerves, the subjective pain perception is projected into the area supplied by the affected nerve (e.g., "musician's bone").
What does the cognitive-evaluative component of pain perception describe?
- The cognitive-evaluative component of pain perception describes the interpretation and re-interpretation of pain (e.g., a patient suspected of having a heart attack who is certain that the pain does not come from the heart but from the stomach because they have eaten too much).
What does the sensory-discriminative component of pain perception describe?
- The sensory-discriminative component of pain perception describes the conscious perception of the quality, location, intensity, duration, and frequency of pain.
What options are there to determine a patient's subjective pain perception?
- To determine a patient's subjective pain perception, one can, for example, use the so-called visual analog scale (a line on which the patient can mark a point that is "analogous" to the intensity of their pain) or a pain-related adjective list (description of pain dimensions).
Which area of the body is the most common location for chronic pain?
- The most common location for chronic pain is the back.
