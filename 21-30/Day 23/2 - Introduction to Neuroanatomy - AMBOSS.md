# Introduction to Neuroanatomy

## Summary

Brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system (CNS). They are protected within the bony skull and the vertebral canal and are surrounded by an additional protective layer – the cerebrospinal fluid. The functions of the CNS are diverse: it integrates stimuli that act on the human organism from the outside or inside, coordinates all motor processes, and also synchronizes all systems with each other. However, its functioning is still not fully understood to this day.

Brain and spinal cord are each composed of gray and white matter. The gray matter mainly consists of nerve cell bodies and is found in the cerebral cortex and in the butterfly-shaped inner part of the spinal cord. The white matter, on the other hand, gets its white color mainly from myelinated nerve fibers: it forms the inner tissue in the brain and the outer tissue in the spinal cord.

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes the nerve tissue outside of the brain and the spinal cord. The distinction between PNS and CNS is purely topographical; functionally, they cannot be distinguished from one another. The role of the PNS is to transmit information between the brain or spinal cord and the rest of the body.

The brain develops from three primary brain vesicles starting in the fourth to fifth week and matures until birth. However, it undergoes constant development and remodeling processes throughout life.
## Central Nervous System

The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the CNS

#### Spinal Cord

See article: Structure of the Spinal Cord

### Microscopic Anatomy of the CNS

The CNS consists of two main tissues: the gray and the white matter. For detailed information on the structure of nerve tissue, see the article Nerve Tissue, Synapses, and Transmitters.

| |Gray Matter|White Matter|
|---|---|---|
|Components|- Main component: Perikarya<br>- Dendrites, Axon<br>- Glial cells|- Main component: Myelinated nerve fibers<br>- Non-myelinated nerve fibers<br>- Glial cells|
|Occurrences in Brain|- Cortex<br>- Nuclei|- White Matter|
|Occurrence in the spinal cord|- Inner layer (divided into anterior horn, lateral horn and posterior horn)|- Outer layer (divided into anterior funiculus, lateral funiculus and posterior funiculus)|
|Task|- Processing of neural impulses|- Transmission of action potentials (AP)|

> [!NOTE]
> The location of the gray and white matter is opposite to each other in the brain and spinal cord!

## Peripheral Nervous System

The peripheral nervous system includes the spinal nerves and the cranial nerves III–XII. The transition between the CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is fluid: At the spinal cord, it is referred to as the PNS starting from the transition to the spinal roots, while the cranial nerves count as part of the PNS from the moment they exit the brainstem.

### Spinal Nerves

Spinal nerves are paired nerves that originate from the spinal cord of the PNS. There are 31–33 spinal nerves, each named after the segment of the spinal cord from which they originate.

| |Number of segments|
|---|---|
|Cervical (C1–C8)|8|
|Thoracic (Th1–Th12)|12|
|Lumbar (L1–L5)|5|
|Sacral (S1–S5)|5|
|Coccygeal (Co1–Co3)|1(–3)|
|Total|31(–33)|

#### Structure and Course

- Origin: Spinal nerves arise from the union of two nerve roots, which emerge ventrally and dorsally from the spinal cord
    - Anterior root (Radix anterior): Contains efferent fibers that extend from the spinal cord to the periphery.
    - Dorsal root (Posterior root): Contains afferent fibers that draw from the periphery to the spinal cord
        - In the area of the dorsal roots lie the spinal ganglia, which contain the cell bodies of the afferent neurons.
- Progress
    - Spinal nerves leave the vertebral canal laterally through the intervertebral foramen, each below the corresponding vertebral body
        - Exception: Cervical nerves
    - Each spinal nerve gives off 4 branches (see table)

|Branches of the spinal nerves|Supply area/endpoint|
|---|---|
|Ramus anterior|- Extremities (via the formation of nerve plexus)<br>- Ventro-lateral trunk wall|
|Ramus posterior|- Autochthonous back muscles<br>- Skin of the back and neck|
|Ramus meningeus|- Meningeal membranes|
|Ramus communicans albus|- Runs to autonomic ganglia (e.g., in the sympathetic trunk)|

#### Radicular Innervation

The segmental organization of the spinal cord plays an important role in the organization of the peripheral nervous system, as each segment innervates a specific area of skin (dermatome) sensitively and certain muscles (key muscles) motorically. Thus, motor failure of a muscle (particularly in combination with sensory failure of a specific area of skin) can be a specific indication of a lesion of a particular nerve root/a spinal nerve.

- Sensible Innervation: Dermatome
    - Definition: Skin area that is sensitively innervated by a spinal nerve
    - Structure: Dermatomes are arranged segmentally.
- Motor innervation: Key muscles
    - Definition: Muscles that can be assigned to a specific segment of the spinal cord

> [!NOTE]
> Helpful reference points when learning the dermatomes are the nipples (transition Th4/Th5), the thenar (C6), the middle finger (C7), the navel (Th10), as well as the front of the knee (L4)!

> [!NOTE] Head's Zones
> Sometimes, the visceral afferent fibers of internal organs converge together with the somatosensory afferent fibers of the skin in the spinal cord onto the neurons of the spinothalamic tract (pain pathway). As a result, pain from an organ is perceived as pain in a specific area of skin known as a Head zone. This type of pain is referred to as "referred pain." Typical examples include the referral of pain from the heart to the area of the left thorax (dermatome Th3/Th4), the referral of pain sensations from the liver to the area under the right rib cage (dermatome Th8–L1), or the referral of pain from the kidneys or the testes to the area of the groin (dermatome Th10–L1).

> [!NOTE] Hip Muscles
> As key muscles, those muscles are referred to that are predominantly innervated by one or sometimes multiple spinal cord segments. A paresis of these muscles or a loss of the corresponding muscle stretch reflex is thus typical for the lesion of the respective segment. This is clinically of great importance, as often the level of a nerve root or spinal cord lesion can be suspected even without imaging diagnostics. The key muscle of segment S1 is, for example, the M. triceps surae, so the inability to stand on tiptoes and the loss of the Achilles reflex can be an indication of a lesion of this segment.

#### Plexus formation

- The anterior rami of neighboring spinal nerves form several nerve plexuses at the level of the extremities.
    - Cervical plexus (C1–C5)
    - Brachial plexus (C5–Th1)
    - Lumbar plexus (Th12–L5)
    - Sacral plexus (L4–S5)
- The nerve fibers of the plexus group together to form peripheral nerves that innervate specific muscles and skin regions.

> [!NOTE]
> The innervation areas of the spinal nerves do not overlap with those of the peripheral nerves!

> [!NOTE] Birth Traumatic Plexus Injuries
> At birth, excessive lateral flexion of the head or strong pulling on the arm can cause a strain of the brachial plexus (especially as a result of deliveries with forceps). This can lead to nerve damage, which, depending on the location, can result in an upper plexus paralysis with shoulder girdle weakness or a lower plexus paralysis with a claw hand position. However, with immobilization and physical therapy, the paralysis typically resolves within a few months.

### Development of the Nervous System

### Embryonic Development of the Brain

The brain begins to develop during the fourth and fifth week of the embryonic period.

- Primary brain vesicles: The brain develops from 3 primary brain vesicles that arise from the neural tube.
    - Prosencephalic vesicle
    - Rhombencephalic vesicle
    - Mesencephalic vesicle
    - Length growth of the bubbles → Curvatures/Bends
        - Neck flexion (between rhombencephalon and spinal cord)
        - Vertex flexure (in the area of the mesencephalon)
        - Bridge bend (between metencephalon and myelencephalon)
    - Thickness growth of the vesicles → Formation of the internal liquor spaces (ventricles)
- Secondary brain vesicles: 2 of the 3 brain vesicles divide, resulting in a total of 5 secondary vesicles (=5-vesicle stage).
    - Prosencephalonbläschen → Telencephalon (Endbrain) and Diencephalon (Interbrain)
    - Mesencephalic vesicle → Mesencephalon (Midbrain)
    - Rhombencephalon → Metencephalon (hindbrain) and Myelencephalon/Medulla oblongata (extended medulla)
- Neuromere
    - Narrow thickenings of nerve tissue at the brain vesicles
    - Functionally divide the neural tube of vertebrates into different segments.
    - One distinguishes prosomeres (about 6), mesomeres (about 2), and rhombomeres (about 8)
        - Prosomer: Segments of the Forebrain
        - Mesomere: Segments of the Mesencephalon
        - Rhombomere: Segments of the Rhombencephalon

### Embryonic Development of the Spinal Cord

The spinal cord develops from the caudal section of the neural tube. The sensory dorsal horns develop from the dorsolaterally located alar plate of the neural tube, while the motor ventral horns arise from the ventrolaterally located basal plate. Until the 4th month, the spinal cord and the vertebral canal develop in parallel, after which there is increased growth of the vertebral column, whose size eventually exceeds that of the spinal cord.

### Histogenesis of the CNS

The formation and development of tissue in the CNS takes longer than all other developmental steps. These processes occur partially simultaneously or sequentially.

- Cell proliferation: Cell division, cell growth
- Migration: The immature neurons (neuroblasts) and glial cells migrate to their target area.
    - Special feature in the CNS: The origin and target site of the neurons can be very far apart.
    - The neuroblasts migrate along specialized glial fibers that are stretched in the brain
- Axon growth: Targeted with the help of the growth cone
- Neuronal differentiation: In the target area, neurotransmitters and receptors are expressed.
- Synaptogenesis: Formation of neural connections that can also be dissolved during neuronal inactivity.
- Apoptosis: Cell death
    - Purpose: Regulation of the number of neurons
    - Trigger: Lack of neurotrophic factors in the target area → Insufficient stimulation of the neurons → Death
- Glial cell development: Develop from the neural tube
- Myelination: Formation of the myelin sheaths
## Review Questions for the Chapter Introduction to Neuroanatomy
Which fiber types are found in the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal cord and what structure do they converge into?
- From each spinal cord segment, one anterior root (Radix anterior) and one posterior root (Radix posterior) arise, which unite for a short section to form the spinal nerve. The Radix anterior contains exclusively motor (somatoefferent) fibers, while the sensory (afferent) fibers run in the Radix posterior.

What is a dermatome? Which dermatomes are associated with the nipples, the thenar, and the navel?
- A dermatome refers to the segmental skin area that is sensibly innervated by a spinal nerve. The nipples are assigned to dermatomes Th4/Th5, the thenar (thumb muscle pad) is considered a reference point for dermatome C6, and the navel lies in dermatome T10. Each dermatome is additionally supplied by its neighboring dermatomes, so that in the case of damage to a single spinal nerve or a single posterior root, there is usually no complete anesthesia of the dermatome.

What is a Head's zone? Where is the Head's zone of the liver?
- Head's zone denotes a skin area in which there is a kind of cross-connection between viszeroafferent fibers of internal organs and somatoafferent fibers of the skin. Both fiber types are jointly switched in the spinal cord onto neurons of the tractus spinothalamicus (= pain pathway), whereby pain of an organ is perceived as pain of a certain skin area ("referred pain"). This area is then called the Head's zone of the respective organ. For the liver, it lies under the right costal arch (dermatomes Th8–L1).

What are neuromeres and rhombomeres?
- The brain develops from three primary brain vesicles (prosencephalon, rhombencephalon, and mesencephalon vesicles), which in turn develop from the neural tube. Neuromeres are narrow thickenings of nerve tissue on the brain vesicles and functionally segment them into different parts. Depending on the brain vesicle, one distinguishes prosomeres, mesomeres, and rhombomeres; the latter are the specific neuromeres of the rhombencephalon.

From which embryonic structures do the anterior and posterior horns of the spinal cord arise?
- The spinal cord develops from the caudal section of the neural tube. The sensory posterior horns develop from the dorsolaterally located alar plate of the neural tube, the motor anterior horns from the ventrolaterally located basal plate.
