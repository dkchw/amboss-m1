# Bladder
## Summary

The bladder is a part of the urinary tract, which is responsible for transporting urine from the kidney to the external opening of the urinary system. It can also store about 500–1,000 mL of urine and release it in a controlled manner (micturition). It is a muscular hollow organ lined with a special epithelium (urothelium) and is located between the ureter and urethra in the pelvic cavity. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on the urinary tract in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the bladder.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile: Urinary Bladder

- Function: Urine transport and storage
- Location: Central in the small basin
- Shape: Spherical
- Volume: Depending on the fill level 500–1,000 mL

### Structure of the Urinary Bladder

The bladder is divided into four sections and has a characteristic internal relief with mucosal folds.

- Sections
    - Apex vesicae (= bladder apex): Ventral and cranial part of the bladder
        - Obliterated urachus (= median umbilical ligament): Continues from the apex of the bladder and extends to the navel.
    - Corpus vesicae (= urinary bladder body): main component of the urinary bladder
    - Fundus vesicae (= bladder base): Caudal part of the urinary bladder with the vesical trigone
    - Cervix vesicae (= bladder neck): Narrow caudal transition into the urethra (= urethra)
- Interior relief
    - Mucosal folds: Diminishing with increasing filling volume of the bladder
    - Trigonum vesicae: Triangular area of mucous membrane at the base of the bladder, which is firmly fused with the muscular layer and does not form mucosal folds.
        - Limitation
            - Internal urethral orifice
            - Interureteric fold: A fold raised by the interureteric muscle.
            - Ostia ureteris: Openings of the two ureters
    - Uvula vesicae: Teardrop-shaped elevation of the bladder mucosa in the area of the cervix of the bladder.
        - Function: Closure and sealing of the urinary bladder outlet pathway

### Topography of the Urinary Bladder

- Location: The bladder is located extra- or pre-peritoneally in the small pelvis behind the pubic arches (= Rr. superiores ossis pubis) and the symphysis; however, its cranial surface is covered by the peritoneum.
    - Lower pole of the bladder: Height of the lower edge of the symphysis
    - Upper pole of the bladder: Depending on the state of filling, between the upper edge of the symphysis and the level of the navel.
- Location relationships
    - Cranial: Urogenital peritoneum (♂ and ♀), uterus (♀)
    - Caudal: Muscle plate of the pelvic diaphragm (♂ and ♀), urethra (♂ and ♀), prostate (♂)
    - Ventral: Retropubic space
    - Lateral: Loose connective tissue with venous plexus (= extraperitoneal space of the pelvis with vesical venous plexus = paracystium)
    - Dorsal
        - ♂: Rectum with rectovesical excavation, ampullae of the ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, ureters
        - ♀: Uterus with vesicouterine excavation (= peritoneal fold)

> [!NOTE] Bladder puncture
> A filled bladder pushes the urogenital peritoneum upward so far that an area free of peritoneum appears at the upper edge of the pubic symphysis. The pubic symphysis provides a good reference point for performing a cranial bladder puncture because it can also be palpated easily in obese patients, among other things. A bladder puncture through the abdominal wall is used in the clinic for sterile urine diagnostics or therapeutically in cases of acute urinary retention.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Urinary Bladder

- Vascular supply
    - Arterial
        - Abdominal aorta → Common iliac artery → Internal iliac artery
            - A. umbilicalis → Superior vesical arteries (→ Ureteric branches)
            - A. vesicalis inferior (→ Rr. prostatici in men)
    - Venous
        - Vesical venous plexus → Vesical veins → Internal iliac vein → Common iliac vein → Inferior vena cava
        - Venous plexus of the vertebrae → Ascending lumbar veins → Azygos/hemiazygos vein → Superior vena cava
        - In men additionally: prostatic venous plexus → vesical venous plexus and vertebral venous plexus
- Lymph drainage
    - Lymph nodes prevesical/retrovesical or lateral vesical lymph nodes → Internal iliac lymph nodes → Common iliac lymph nodes → Right/Intermediate/Left lumbar lymph nodes → Right/Left lumbar trunk → Chyle cistern → Thoracic duct
- Innervation
    - Efferenzen: Vesical plexus
        - Sympathetic: Lumbar and sacral splanchnic nerves → Switch in the inferior mesenteric ganglion or inferior hypogastric plexus
        - Parasympathetic: Pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2–4) → Synapse in the inferior hypogastric plexus or in the organ wall
            - Acts mainly during micturition: Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder
        - Intrinsic: Autonomic ganglion cells in the adventitia
    - Afferents: Fibers run with pelvic splanchnic nerves

> [!NOTE] Cross-section syndrome
> The Nn. splanchnici are primarily involved in the regulation of micturition. They receive their signals mainly from the pontine micturition center. In the case of a spinal cord injury leading to the destruction of these signaling nerve fibers, the so-called spinal shock occurs initially, which is characterized by an atonic, flaccid bladder. After about 6-8 weeks, there is a recovery of the reflexive contraction of the M. detrusor vesicae (= viscerovisceral reflex). Through a special training, affected patients can learn to convert this reflex, allowing them to trigger a contraction of the M. detrusor vesicae by tapping the abdominal skin (= cutanovisceral reflex). This enables them to control the emptying of their bladder despite a spinal cord injury.

## Microscopic Anatomy

### Wall Structure

- Mucous membrane
    - Urothelium (= Transitional epithelium)
        - Epithelial cells: Height and number of layers vary depending on the filling and stretching state of the bladder.
        - Umbrella Cells: Single-layered special epithelial cells (so-called umbrella cells)
            - Tight Junctions: Deck cells are firmly connected to each other.
            - Uroplakin (= "Plaques"): Apically deposited, stiff plaques of the umbrella cells
            - "Hinges": Membrane components that lie between the plaques and connect them flexibly.
        - Function
            - Permeability barrier against the passage of urine and water-soluble substances
            - Protective barrier against irritating components of urine (e.g. against uric acid)
            - Adjustment to the state of fullness of the bladder
    - Lamina propria: Connective tissue layer made of loose collagenous connective tissue and a dense capillary plexus.
- Muscularis layer
    - M. detrusor vesicae ("bladder emptying muscle"): Three spiral-shaped layers of smooth muscle.
        - Stratum longitudinale internum: Inner, narrow longitudinal muscle
        - Stratum circulare: Strong circular muscle
        - Stratum longitudinale externum: Outer, narrow longitudinal muscle
            - Dorsal: M. vesicoprostaticus (♂), M. vesicovaginalis (♀)
            - Ventral: M. pubovesicalis
    - M. sphincter vesicae internus ("bladder sphincter", also known as "internus"): smooth muscle
- Adventitia (Surrounding connective tissue) or serosa

### Function

### Bladder closure (= continence)

Continence refers to the ability to hold urine, unless one intends to urinate voluntarily. It is based on a coordinated interplay of contraction and relaxation of the involved muscles with the anatomical support system.

### Process of Bladder Emptying (= Micturition)

1. Activation of stretch receptors through the filling of the bladder
2. Afferents project into the sacral micturition center (S2-3) and into the pontine micturition center.
3. Afferent fibers lead to the bladder and cause a
    - Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder → Increase in bladder internal pressure
    - Contraction of the muscle of the trigone of the bladder → Closure of the ureter openings
    - Relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle of the bladder as well as contraction of the dilator muscle of the urethra and the pubovesical muscle → Expansion of the urethral opening
4. Arbitrary: Relaxation of the external urethral sphincter muscle
5. Micturition

> [!NOTE] Urinary incontinence
> Urinary incontinence is a common medical condition characterized by uncontrolled loss of urine. The most common forms are stress incontinence and urge incontinence. In stress incontinence, urine loss occurs with increases in intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., coughing or laughing), usually caused by damage to the muscles that maintain continence or by overstretching of the support structures. Urge incontinence, on the other hand, is a bladder storage disorder that is often due to overactivity of the detrusor muscle and is frequently accompanied by an urgent need to urinate.

## Development of the Urinary Bladder

The urinary bladder develops from the cloaca, the common excretory organ, between the 5th and 10th week, from which the urogenital tract and the distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract develop.

### Components of the Cloaca

- Urogenital sinus
    - The cranial part differentiates into the urinary bladder and is connected to the allantois (later the urachus or median umbilical ligament).
    - Caudal portion differentiates into the urethra.
    - Additionally forms parts of the genital organs (see "Sexual Development")
- Urorectal septum
    - The urorectal septum grows cranially between the urogenital sinus and the anorectal canal until it reaches the cloacal membrane.
        - Ventral forms the septum the urogenital membrane.
        - Dorsally, the septum forms the anal membrane.
- Cloacal membrane: The cloacal membrane closes the cloaca ventrally.
- Anorectal canal: Final section of the digestive system

> [!NOTE] Urachal fistula
> In early development, the urinary bladder formation has an open connection to the umbilical cord via the allantois. In the further course, this develops into the urachus, a fibrous cord on the anterior abdominal wall between the apex of the bladder and the umbilicus, whose lumen becomes obliterated. If closure fails or is incomplete, a canal from the bladder to the navel may remain. In the newborn, this so-called urachus fistula is noticeable due to the discharge of urine from the navel and should be surgically removed.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Bladder
What influence does the autonomic nervous system have on the internal sphincter muscles and the detrusor muscle of the bladder?
- The Mm. sphincter vesicae internus and detrusor vesicae belong to the involuntary bladder musculature and are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The task of the sympathetic nervous system is the prevention of bladder emptying (continence): Under its influence, the M. sphincter vesicae internus (bladder neck muscle) contracts and closes the bladder. The M. detrusor vesicae is also called the "bladder emptier" and is inhibited during sympathetic activity. The parasympathetic nervous system, in contrast, initiates micturition by contracting the detrusor and relaxing the internal sphincter.

Describe the course of the parasympathetic nerve fibers relevant to micturition from the spinal cord segments to the bladder!
- The origin neurons of the parasympathetic nerve fibers relevant to micturition lie in the lateral horns of the spinal cord segments S2–S4. From there, they travel as the pelvic splanchnic nerves (Nn. splanchnici pelvici) to the inferior hypogastric plexus, where they synapse on their second neuron. They end in the bladder wall, where they are mainly responsible for the innervation of the M. detrusor vesicae, whose contraction initiates micturition.
