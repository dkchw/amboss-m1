# Circulatory Regulation
## Summary

The task of the circulatory system is to ensure a continuous organ perfusion by means of arterial blood pressure. For this purpose, either the arterial blood pressure or the blood flow to the target organ itself can be adjusted. To regulate arterial blood pressure, sensors are needed that measure the current state of the circulatory parameters and transmit their information to centrally located circulatory regulation centers in the reticular formation. These integrate the incoming information and temporarily alter primarily the activity of the autonomic nervous system and, in the long term, especially the blood volume. In this regard, the kidney is at the center as the executing organ.

In addition to central control mechanisms through innervation and hormone secretion, the organs are, to some extent, capable of autonomously regulating their perfusion through local mechanisms.
## Overview of the Structures of Circulatory Regulation

To regulate organ perfusion, it is necessary that circulatory parameters such as pressure, volume status, pH, etc., are registered with sensors, and this information is then processed in a central regulatory center. The regulatory center (in the reticular formation) now acts on various effectors to control blood flow in the short and long term.

### Sensors of Circulatory Regulation

- Baroreceptors: Detect blood pressure in the systemic circulation and regulate it through the autonomic nervous system.
- Volume receptors: Detect the volume in the pulmonary circulation and regulate it through the autonomic nervous system, ANP, and ADH.
- Chemoreceptors: Detect the pH level and the concentrations of respiratory gases and regulate them through breathing.

### Central Circulatory Regulation Center

- Definition: Neuron networks that are involved in the regulation of circulatory parameters.
- Localization: Reticular formation (in medulla oblongata and pons)
- Function: Regulates blood pressure to "normal" blood pressure values by taking into account the incoming afferents ("measured values") from the circulatory sensors.

### Key Mediators of Regulation

- Short-term
    - Resistance vessels: Can change blood pressure through resistance increase.
    - Capacity vessels: Can reduce the effective circulating blood volume through vasodilation.
    - Heart: Can change blood pressure by adjusting stroke volume and frequency.
- Long-term
    - Kidneys: Can regulate blood volume through adjustments in excretion.
## Short-term Blood Pressure Regulation

To adjust to short-term blood pressure fluctuations, important circulatory parameters are measured using pressure, volume, and chemoreceptors. Their afferents are mostly transmitted via the vagus nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve to the central circulation centers, where they are processed. In short-term blood pressure regulation, the circulation center in the medulla oblongata primarily influences the activity of the autonomic nervous system, which in turn affects the heart and the resistance and capacitance vessels.

### Summary of the short-term effects of the VNS on the circulatory system

The short-term regulation of blood pressure is mainly mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. When the cardiovascular centers are activated, the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are regulated oppositely, so that, for example, in the case of an observed increase in blood pressure, the sympathetic nervous system is inhibited and the parasympathetic nervous system is activated. Therefore, it is always important to consider the interplay of these two systems. The following summarizes how this regulation occurs.

- Effects of sympathetic stimulation
    - Heart: Inotropy and heart rate↑
    - Arteries: Vascular tone (especially in the resistance vessels)↑ → Total peripheral resistance↑
    - Veins: Vascular tone↑ → Constriction of capacitance vessels → Mobilization of more central blood volume → Filling pressure of the heart (preload)↑ → Stroke volume↑
- Effects of parasympathetic stimulation
    - Heart: Heart rate↓
    - Veins: Vessel tone↓ → More volume is "pooled" in the capacitance vessels → Central blood volume↓ → Filling pressure of the heart (preload)↓ → Stroke volume↓

### Regulation by the baroreceptors

Baroreceptors detect blood pressure in the large systemic circulation and primarily regulate it through an adjustment of the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.

- Occurrence: Primarily located in the aorta near the heart and the carotid sinus (i.e., in the high-pressure system!)
- Receptor type: Proportional-Differential Receptor
- Mechanism: Measure the elongation of the vessel wall (and thus the pressure in the high-pressure system)
- Process of regulation
    - Initial state
        - Pressure receptors generate action potentials with a specific base frequency.
        - This has an activating effect on the parasympathetic nervous system and an inhibitory effect on the sympathetic nervous system → Normal "low" blood pressure levels are maintained.
    - Reaction to blood pressure changes
        - Blood pressure increase: Through the activation of mechanosensitive cation channels, the impulse frequency of the baroreceptors increases → Parasympathetic tone↑ and sympathetic tone↓
            - Heart rate and stroke volume decrease, capacity vessels and resistance vessels are dilated → blood pressure decreases
        - Blood pressure drop: Impulse frequency of the baroreceptors decreases → Parasympathetic tone↓ and sympathetic tone↑ → Increase in heart rate and stroke volume, vasoconstriction of capacitance vessels and resistance vessels → Blood pressure rises
            - At the same time, activation of long-term regulatory mechanisms
                - ADH secretion ↑
                - Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

> [!NOTE]
> The pressure receptors are only suitable for adapting to short-term blood pressure changes, as their activity (i.e., their firing frequency) adjusts to a new blood pressure level within a few days!

> [!NOTE]
> Blood pressure is physiologically lower at night than during the day (so-called dipping)! The literature discusses, among other things, set-point changes of the baroreceptors as a cause.

> [!NOTE] Carotid sinus syndrome
> If the pressure sensors of the carotid sinus react too sensitively, even small stimuli like turning the head or the pressure of a shirt collar can lead to an excessive drop in blood pressure and even fainting. This is referred to as carotid sinus syndrome.

### Regulation by the volume receptors

The volume receptors of the heart work synergistically with the pressure receptors of the circulatory system. However, since they also influence blood volume, they play an important role not only in short-term blood pressure regulation but also in long-term blood pressure regulation.

- Goal
    - Short-term regulation of blood pressure and circulating blood volume through adjustment of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and vascular tone (via ADH)
    - Additionally, long-term regulation of blood volume through adjustment of water excretion in the kidneys (via the hormones ANP and ADH)
- Occurrence: Located in the pulmonary artery and in the heart atria (i.e., in the low-pressure system!)
- Mechanism: Registering the stretching of the vessel wall and the myocardium (and thus the "volume status") in the low-pressure system → Mediating circulatory regulatory reflexes (analogous to the baroreceptors)
- Course of regulation: Occurs through two reflexes: Atrial stretch reflex and Gauer-Henry reflex
    - Atrial stretch reflex: Adjusts blood pressure in response to increased or decreased atrial stretch through modulation of the autonomic nervous system and ANP secretion.
        - Blood volume increased (Atrium is being stretched)
            1. Increased release of ANP → NaCl and water excretion in the kidneys↑
            2. Parasympathetic tone↑ and sympathetic tone↓
        - Blood volume reduced (Atria are less stretched)
            1. Release of ANP from cardiomyocytes decreases → NaCl and water excretion in the kidney↓
            2. Parasympathetic tone↓ and sympathetic tone↑
    - Gauer-Henry Reflex (= Diuretic Reflex): Adjusts the release of ADH in the hypothalamus to the blood pressure.
        - Blood pressure increase: Atrial stretch receptors (Type B) inhibit ADH release in the hypothalamus via vagal afferents → Water excretion in the kidney↑
        - Blood pressure drop → ADH release↑ → Water excretion in the kidney↓

### Regulation by Chemoreceptors

There are central (located in the CNS) and peripheral chemoreceptors that measure not only the partial pressures of the main respiratory gases but also the pH level of the blood. Through their influence on the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, they regulate blood pressure.

- Receptors
    - Peripheral chemoreceptors
        - Localization: Glomus caroticum and Glomus aorticum
        - Function: Measurement of partial pressures (O2, CO2), pH
    - Central chemoreceptors
        - Localization: Medulla Oblongata
        - Function: Measurement of partial pressures (CO2) and pH
- Regulatory mechanisms
    - Increase sympathetic activity with rising CO2, decreasing O2, and decreasing pH.
    - Modulation of respiration (see respiratory regulation)

### Long-term Blood Pressure Regulation

The long-term regulation of blood pressure mainly occurs through the control of water and electrolyte balance. The focus here is on influencing the filtration processes of the kidneys.

### Regulatory Mechanisms

1. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)
    - Stimulation of the RAAS by:
        - Renal blood flow drops below 80 mmHg
        - Decreased osmolarity of blood plasma
        - Sodium content of blood plasma↓
    - Regulatory mechanism: Release of renin in the juxtaglomerular apparatus → Activation of the RAAS → Direct vasoconstriction and extracellular volume increase (NaCl and water reabsorption increase, K+ decrease, pH increase)
2. Gauer-Henry Reflex (via ADH) (see above)
3. Atrial stretch reflex (via ANP) (see above)

> [!NOTE] ACE inhibitor
> Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is significantly involved in the long-term regulation of blood pressure, it represents an ideal target when a patient's blood pressure needs to be lowered. Pharmacologically, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II can be influenced by the "angiotensin-converting enzyme" (ACE) through so-called ACE inhibitors. On the other hand, the effect of angiotensin II at the receptors of target cells can be inhibited by so-called AT1 receptor antagonists ("sartans").

## Regulatory Mechanisms of Organ Perfusion

Organ blood flow can be regulated through local and central mechanisms. Some local mechanisms are intended to keep organ blood flow constant (Bayliss effect, myogenic autoregulation), while others adjust blood flow specifically to the activity of the organ (metabolic autoregulation). Central regulatory mechanisms, such as the autonomic innervation of supplying vessels and the effects of circulating hormones like catecholamines or angiotensin, provide support in this process.

### Local Regulation of Organ Perfusion

#### Metabolic Autoregulation

- Definition: Mechanism that adjusts organ perfusion based on circulatory metabolites to organ activity.
- Triggers: "Used" cycle metabolites↑ (e.g. pCO2↑, lactate↑, H+↑, ADP↑, AMP↑, adenosine↑ and pO2↓)
- Reaction: Vasodilation
- Occurrence: Organs with highly variable activity (e.g., skeletal muscle, heart, exocrine glands)

#### Myogenic Autoregulation (Bayliss Effect)

- Definition: Reflexive vasoconstriction of the vessels with increased transmural pressure
- Goal: Maintaining a constant organ perfusion despite systemic blood pressure fluctuations.
- Trigger: Increased transmural pressure
- Reaction: Vasoconstriction
- Occurrence: (Almost) all organs, especially the kidney and brain

> [!NOTE]
> Only in the lungs is there no myogenic autoregulation. Here, an increase in transmural pressure leads to an increase in the diameter of the distensible pulmonary vessels (so-called pressure passivity)!

#### Chemical Autoregulation

- Definition: Secretion of vasoactive substances (so-called autacoids) by the endothelium for the autoregulation of vascular diameter.
- Involved substances and their effects
    - Nitric oxide (NO)
        - Definition: Short-lived vasoactive substance that is primarily produced by the endothelium through NO synthase from arginine.
        - Trigger
            - Increased shear stress in the vessel
            - Binding of vasoactive substances to endothelial receptors (e.g., serotonin, bradykinin)
        - Effect: Vasodilation of small arteries and arterioles
            - Mechanism of action: Activation of a guanylate cyclase in the vascular smooth muscle cells
    - Endothelin
        - Definition: Vasoactive Peptide
        - Effect: Vasoconstrictor/vasodilator (depending on the receptor)
        - Meaning: Endothelins play a role primarily in pathological processes (e.g., in circulatory shock)
    - Eicosanoid
        - Definition: Group of arachidonic acid derivatives, some of which are vasoactive (e.g., prostaglandins, thromboxane)
        - Effect: Varies
    - Other vasoactive substances: Kinins, Histamine, Serotonin

> [!NOTE] Nitrate
> If, for example, an acute under-supply of the heart muscle occurs due to a vascular stenosis, this can manifest itself in pain or a feeling of tightness and is called angina pectoris. To improve the blood supply to the heart, the affected person can be given a medication that releases nitric oxide. On one hand, this directly dilates the supplying coronary arteries, which improves the immediate blood flow to the heart. On the other hand, the venous capacitance vessels also dilate, leading to so-called venous pooling, meaning that more volume is stored in the capacitance vessels. This reduces venous return and preload, which lowers the workload of the heart, positively affecting the oxygen demand of the heart.

### Central Regulation of Organ Perfusion

- Mechanisms
    - Nervale Regulation: Regulation of organ perfusion through modulation of vascular tone by sympathetic nerve fibers
    - Hormonal Regulation: Regulation of organ blood flow by hormones circulating in the blood (especially catecholamines from the adrenal medulla)
- Receptors: In the vessels, the central regulation is primarily mediated by α1 and β2 receptors.
    - α1-receptors → Vasoconstriction
    - β2-receptors → Vasodilation
- Effects of catecholamines
    - Adrenaline → Affects both receptor types, but β-receptors respond more sensitively.
    - Norepinephrine → Primarily acts on α-receptors → Mainly vasoconstriction

> [!NOTE]
> Whether it ultimately leads to vasoconstriction or vasodilation in an organ primarily depends on the locally prevailing receptor types (α1, β2, etc.) and the type of catecholamines acting on them!

> [!NOTE] Circulatory shock
> If the function of vital organs is impaired due to microcirculatory disorders and insufficient perfusion, this is referred to as circulatory shock. For example, in the case of an injury resulting in significant blood loss (so-called volume deficiency shock), this is registered by pressure and volume sensors and primarily leads to an increase in sympathetic tone. In addition to an increase in heart rate, the sympathetic nervous system also causes the constriction of peripheral vessels (e.g., the extremities), resulting in a redistribution of blood to the vital organs (so-called centralization). Through additional constriction of the resistance vessels, an attempt is made to generate a sufficiently high blood pressure despite the low circulating blood volume. The constriction of the resistance vessels also lowers the effective filtration pressure in the downstream capillary areas (Starling's formula), leading to an increased reabsorption of volume into the venous vascular system (“autotransfusion”). All of these mechanisms attempt to compensate for the cause of circulatory shock, which, however, is only possible to a certain extent or for a limited time. If a circulatory shock decompensates, this can lead to multiple organ damage/failure and even death due to insufficient organ supply.

## Special Features of Organ Perfusion

Since the requirements and tasks of the various organs differ significantly from one another, they are supplied with different proportions of cardiac output. To regulate this blood flow, the regulatory mechanisms described above operate to varying degrees in the different organs.

### Proportional and Specific Organ Perfusion

The specific organ perfusion is the blood flow of an organ per minute relative to 100 g of organ weight. This allows for the comparison of the blood flow of organs of different sizes. The proportion of the cardiac output, on the other hand, indicates how much of the total circulating blood is used for the perfusion of the individual organs.

|Organ|Share of HZV  <br>%]|[Specific Organ Blood Flow  <br>[mL/min per 100 g Organ Weight]|
|---|---|---|
|Intestines|30|50|
|Kidneys|20|350|
|Muscle|20|3|
|Brain|15|50|
|Skin and Skeleton|10|10|
|Myocardium|5|85|

### Characteristics of Blood Circulation in Individual Organs

#### Lunge

- Special features of lung circulation
    - Is flowed through by the entire HZV
- Regulatory mechanisms
    - Vascular diameter changes passively with pressure → Pulmonary arterial pressure remains approximately constant
    - Adjustment of vascular perfusion to ventilation → Hypoventilation (hypoxia) causes vasoconstriction (Euler-Liljestrand mechanism)

#### Kidney

- Special features of renal blood flow
    - Highest specific organ perfusion
    - Extremely low oxygen consumption (∼10%)
- Regulation mechanism: In particular, myogenic autoregulation (Bayliss effect)

#### Skeletal Muscle

- Special features of skeletal muscle blood flow
    - High cardiac output proportion with overall large weight → Low specific blood flow → But can be massively increased during work (20–30 times)
- Regulatory mechanisms
    - Local metabolic and chemical autoregulation
    - Nervale Regulation

#### Brain

- Special features of cerebral circulation
    - Overall organ perfusion very constant
    - Local blood circulation is strongly activity-dependent.
- Regulatory mechanisms: In particular, local metabolic autoregulation (O2, CO2, pH) and myogenic autoregulation (Bayliss effect)

#### Skin

- Features of skin circulation
    - Cutaneous blood flow serves temperature regulation → Strongly variable proportion of cardiac output
    - Specific blood flow highly adjustable through arteriovenous anastomoses
- Regulatory mechanisms
    - Akren: Especially sympathetic innervation
    - Body trunk: In particular, local chemical autoregulation

#### Myocardium

- Specific features of myocardial perfusion
    - High specific blood flow that can only be slightly increased under stress (coronary reserve)
    - Greatest arteriovenous O2 difference (oxygen extraction ∼70-80%)
- Regulatory mechanism: In particular, local metabolic autoregulation

### Circulatory Regulation in Specific Situations

In everyday life, the circulatory system must constantly adjust to the activity and external conditions of the person.

### Orthostasis

Upon standing up, the circulatory system must adjust to the hydrostatic pressure conditions in the vessels that are altered by gravity.

- Starting situation: Transitioning from lying or sitting to standing
- Problem: Approximately 500 mL of the central blood volume "pools" in the capacity vessels of the legs.
- Introduction of counter-regulation: Venous return to the heart↓ → Preload↓ → Stroke volume↓ → Cardiac output↓ → Systolic blood pressure↓ → Impulse frequency of baroreceptors and volume receptors↓ → Counter-regulation (see above)
- Effects of counterregulation
    - Vasoconstriction of the resistance vessels → Total peripheral resistance↑
    - Vasoconstriction of the capacitance vessels → Venous return↑
    - Catecholamine release in the adrenal medulla↑
    - Heart rate↑ → Cardiac output (CO) is overall slightly decreased due to the reduced stroke volume (SV) despite the increased heart rate (SV decreases more significantly than CO)
    - Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system → Vasoconstriction (and long-term volume retention)
    - Increased ADH secretion → Volume retention

> [!NOTE] Orthostatic Syncope
> The adjustment reactions in the context of orthostasis are intended to ensure that a sufficiently high arterial blood pressure is generated to maintain organ perfusion. If these regulatory mechanisms are insufficient, it leads to underperfusion of the organs. In this case, the underperfusion of the brain is particularly noticeable in the form of visual disturbances, dizziness, or even loss of consciousness. Such a loss of consciousness when standing up from a lying position is referred to as orthostatic syncope.

## Review Questions on the Chapter on Circulatory Regulation
### Short-term Blood Pressure Regulation

What are baroreceptors and how do they respond to decreases and increases in blood pressure?  
- Baroreceptors are sensors in the vessel walls (especially in the aorta near the heart and the carotid sinus) that detect and regulate blood pressure. If blood pressure is elevated, the vessel wall stretches and thereby activates the receptors. Their impulses in turn activate the parasympathetic nervous system and inhibit the sympathetic nervous system. As a result, heart rate and stroke volume decrease, and the peripheral vessels dilate (vasodilation): this leads to a drop in blood pressure. If, on the other hand, blood pressure is reduced, the impulse frequency of the baroreceptors decreases, leading to the opposite reaction with an increase in blood pressure.

Describe the effects of sympathetic activation on the circulatory system!  
- The short-term regulation of circulation is mainly controlled by the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. A predominance of sympathetic activity leads to an increase in heart rate and the inotropy of the heart muscle. In addition, vasoconstriction of the resistance and capacitance vessels increases the total peripheral resistance and the venous return to the heart. Overall, this results in an increase in blood pressure.

How does the so-called atrial stretch reflex work?  
- The atrial stretch reflex is a mechanism of blood pressure regulation via volume receptors located in the atrium. If blood volume is increased, the atrium stretches, which is registered by the receptors. This leads to increased secretion of ANP, which enhances sodium and water excretion in the kidney and simultaneously causes vasodilation. In addition, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated and the sympathetic nervous system inhibited. If blood volume is reduced, the atrium is less stretched, resulting in the opposite reaction (ANP↓, parasympathetic↓, sympathetic↑).

How does the Gauer-Henry reflex work? Which hormone's release is influenced by it? What effect does the hormone have?  
- The Gauer-Henry reflex is a stretch reflex that adjusts the release of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the hypothalamus according to blood pressure. Type-B atrial stretch receptors detect changes in blood volume and subsequently stimulate or reduce the secretion of ADH from the nucleus supraopticus and nucleus paraventricularis of the hypothalamus. ADH decreases water excretion in the kidney and leads to an increase in blood pressure.

Through which measure does the body attempt to maintain the supply of vital organs such as the brain and heart during an acute blood loss?  
- Acute blood loss is detected by volume and pressure receptors in the vessels and heart. This leads to activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of catecholamines, which in turn cause vasoconstriction of the capacitance and resistance vessels and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. This results in a redistribution of cardiac output favoring the heart and brain (so-called centralization).

What is meant by the so-called night-time "Dipping"?  
- Blood pressure is subject to physiological fluctuations. The physiological decrease in mean systolic blood pressure at night compared to the average daytime value is also referred to as "dipping".

### Regulatory Mechanisms of Organ Perfusion

What is the so-called Bayliss effect (myogenic autoregulation)?  
- The Bayliss effect describes a reflexive vasoconstriction of small blood vessels in response to an increase in transmural pressure. This ensures that blood pressure within organs remains constant despite systemic fluctuations (e.g., during physical activity). This mechanism is particularly important in the kidney and brain.

Through which regulatory mechanism can the blood flow of an organ be specifically adjusted to its activity?  
- The blood flow of an organ can be adjusted based on its "consumed" metabolic metabolites (e.g., increased pCO2, lactate, H+, ADP, AMP, adenosine and decreased pO2). This mechanism is called metabolic autoregulation. If many metabolic metabolites accumulate, this indicates high organ activity and vasodilation is induced to increase blood supply.

Which substance secreted by the vascular endothelium leads to the relaxation of the smooth muscle of small vessels? Which enzyme plays a role in this?  
- Nitric oxide (NO), produced by the endothelium, serves the autoregulation of vessel diameter and diffuses in response to mechanical stimuli from the endothelial cells into the vascular smooth muscle. There, activation of soluble guanylate cyclase lowers the intracellular calcium concentration, resulting in relaxation and vasodilation.

### Circulatory Regulation in Special Situations

When changing positions from lying down to standing up, there is a drop in blood pressure in the upper body. Through which regulatory mechanisms can adequate perfusion of the brain be maintained nonetheless?  
- When rising from a lying position, the brain risks underperfusion due to the drop in blood pressure. This is prevented by the so-called orthostatic response, which is based on mechanisms of short-term blood pressure regulation. Pressure and volume receptors in the atria and vessels near the heart detect the blood pressure drop and respond with activation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system. This leads, among other things, to vasoconstriction with an increase in peripheral resistance and venous return, as well as an increase in heart rate. Overall, there is a short-term blood pressure drop upon standing, but due to counter-regulation, cerebral perfusion is maintained and blood pressure rises quickly.

How do cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate change when shifting from lying down to standing up?  
- Upon standing, part of the blood "pools" in the leg veins, reducing venous return to the heart and its filling. This leads to a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output. Compensatorily, heart rate increases to mitigate but not fully compensate for the drop in cardiac output (CO = HR × SV).
