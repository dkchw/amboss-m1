# From Fertilization to Implantation
## Summary

The first week of embryonic development (pre-embryonic period) includes the processes that lead from the fertilization of the egg to implantation. During this time, the mature egg released during ovulation is fertilized in the ampulla of the tube and then undergoes a maturation process so that it can implant in the uterine lining. The sperm also needs to mature further to make its way to the egg. After the fusion of the egg and sperm, the now diploid zygote is formed, which immediately begins cell division. Through several division steps, the embryo develops into the morula and ultimately the implantation-capable blastocyst. After the differentiation of the two cell layers of the embryo into embryoblast and trophoblast, the blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida and implantation of the embryo in the uterine lining occurs around day 6. If multiple eggs are fertilized or if an egg later divides into two embryonic structures, a multiple pregnancy with identical or fraternal twins occurs.
## The Preembryonic Development

After ovulation, the mature, fertilizable egg is located in the fallopian tube and can be fertilized there by a mature sperm. In the pre-implantation phase, the fertilized egg then travels into the uterine cavity, where implantation occurs on the 6th day of development.

- Outline
    1. Fertilization
    2. Pre-implantation phase
    3. Implantation
- Duration: 0–7 days after fertilization (Pre-embryonic period)
- Goal: Differentiation into trophoblast and embryoblast as a prerequisite for the further development and implantation of the embryo in the zona compacta of the endometrium.
## Fertilization (Fertilisation, Conception)

During intercourse, approximately 200-600 million sperm enter the vagina, most of which die within a short time. The remaining sperm ascend to the ampulla of the tubes and undergo a maturation process (capacitation) during this time. In addition, the so-called acrosome reaction occurs, which enables the sperm to penetrate the egg. By attaching to the egg membrane, the sperm provides the necessary signal to complete the second meiotic division. Finally, the fusion of the two germ cells creates the zygote, which immediately begins cell division.

- Location: Mostly in the ampulla of the uterine tube
- Time window
    - Within 24 hours after ovulation
    - The conception optimum is two days before to one day after ovulation.
- Process
    - Coitus (sexual intercourse): Sperm reside in the posterior vaginal vault after ejaculation.
    - Ascension
        - Ascension of the sperm through the cervix and uterus to the ampulla of the tube
        - Meanwhile, capacitation takes place.
    - Capacitation (functional maturation of sperm in the female genital tract)
        - Cholesterol is removed from the cell membrane of the sperm, making it more unstable.
        - This step is necessary for the acrosome reaction to occur.
    - Penetration of the corona radiata
        - Only functionally mature sperm can penetrate the corona radiata.
    - Acrosome reaction
        - Induced by contact with the zona pellucida
        - Fusion of the sperm membrane with the outer acrosomal membrane
        - Release of the hydrolytic enzymes (hyaluronidases) from the acrosome
        - The outer shell of the sperm head now mainly consists of the inner acrosomal membrane with the protease acrosin.
        - Penetration of the zona pellucida
            - Cleavage of the glycoproteins of the zona pellucida by means of acrosin
            - Sperm enters the space between the zona pellucida and the egg cell membrane (perivitelline space)
    - Impregnation
        - (Rest‑)cell membranes of oocyte and sperm merge
        - The nucleus penetrates into the oocyte along with other cell components.
    - Cortical reaction with polyspermy block: change in the oocyte membrane as well as hardening of the zona pellucida
    - Termination of the 2nd maturation division: formation of the female pronucleus
    - Approach of the two pre-nuclei: In this process, both pre-nuclei double their DNA (1n1C → 1n2C)
    - Nucleus fusion (syngamy, conjugation)
        - The core shells of the pre-nucleus dissolve → Fusion
        - The resulting zygote now has a diploid chromosome set (2n4C) and begins cell division.

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to the DNA of the cell nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively from the mother, as paternal mitochondria are degraded after fertilization!

> [!NOTE] Sterility and infertility
> If a pregnancy does not occur despite regular unprotected intercourse within a year, it is referred to as sterility. The inability to carry a pregnancy to the child's viability, even though conception is generally possible, is referred to as infertility in women. Sterility and infertility can have various causes: the most common cause in women is tubal blockage, which can occur after an infection or as part of endometriosis. To assess ovarian activity or follicle reserve, particularly in older women, the anti-Müllerian hormone can be measured, which is produced by the granulosa cells of the follicles. Depending on the cause of sterility, there are a variety of therapeutic options. In addition to determining the optimum time for conception, hormone therapy can be initiated, which results in a pregnancy in 30% of cases. Surgical procedures are also possible, such as restoring tubal patency or removing implantation obstacles. The last resort is artificial insemination.

> [!NOTE] Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
> The assisted reproductive technology (ART) – or artificial insemination – is the last resort for people who remain involuntarily childless. There are various methods involved, with in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) being the most common methods. In IVF, sperm and eggs are brought together in a test tube (from Latin "in vitro" = "in glass") and transferred to the uterus after incubation. ICSI is performed similarly; however, the sperm are not just added to the egg but are directly injected into the egg under microscopic observation. Generally, with ART, the rate of multiple pregnancies is increased; additionally, the risk of chromosomal abnormalities rises. Reasons for this include the generally older average age of mothers and the generally reduced sperm quality of fathers who undergo ART.

## Pre-implantation Phase

During the journey through the tube, the fertilized egg divides multiple times before arriving as a blastocyst at the implantation site in the uterus.

- Location: Fallopian tube and uterus
- Time window: 2nd to 5th day of embryonic development
- Stadiums
    - Zygote: Immediately after the pre-nuclear fusion, the zygote undergoes the first cleavage division.
    - Two-cell stage: After division, there are two equally sized blastomeres present.
    - More cell stages: Following further cleavage divisions, the 4-, 8-, and finally the 16-cell stage occurs.
    - Morula
        - Designation of the germ cell starting from the 16-cell stage
        - Further surrounded by the protective zona pellucida, which prevents premature implantation.
        - Reaches the uterus about 4 days after fertilization → Beginning of differentiation into the blastocyst
    - Blastocyst
        - Through the inflow of fluid from the outside, a fluid-filled cavity (blastocyst cavity) forms between the outermost cell layer and the inner cell layer.
        - The outer and inner cell layers further differentiate into trophoblast and embryoblast.
            - Outer cell layer (trophoblast)
                - Closes together through cell-cell connections (compaction)
                - Later forms the embryonic part of the placenta
            - Inner cell layer (embryoblast)
                - Primarily forms the embryonic body cells later

> [!NOTE]
> While the zygote was still omnipotent, the cells of the blastocyst are merely pluripotent!

> [!NOTE]
> The size of the embryo does not change from the zygote to the blastocyst, as the size of the blastomeres is halved with each cell division!

> [!NOTE] Ectopic pregnancy
> If there is an early loss of the zona pellucida, the embryo may implant outside of the physiological location in the uterine cavity. The most common site for ectopic implantation is the fallopian tube, especially since inflammatory stenoses often develop in the context of ascending genital infections. These are impassable for the fertilized egg, leading to ectopic implantation. Ectopic pregnancies usually become clinically apparent only when, for example, a tubal abortion or a rupture of the tube causes blood to enter the free abdominal cavity and, due to peritoneal irritation, results in an acute abdomen. Ectopic pregnancy can represent a life-threatening situation.

> [!NOTE] Preimplantation diagnosis
> In preimplantation diagnosis (PID), the diagnosis of genetic diseases takes place before the fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus. Basically, this is prohibited in Germany under the Embryo Protection Act (ESchG). However, there are some exceptions that allow for preimplantation diagnosis. These include a genetic predisposition of the mother or father for a severe hereditary disease, as well as the suspicion of a serious impairment of the embryo that would very likely lead to stillbirth or miscarriage. In these cases, however, it is essential that there is informed consent, counseling, and approval from the woman, as well as the consent of an interdisciplinary ethics committee. Furthermore, the PID may only be carried out by a qualified physician. No physician is obligated to perform a PID.

## Implantation (= Nidation)

The blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida around day 5 and is capable of implantation from this point on. However, before the actual implantation process, the trophoblast first differentiates into syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast invades the uterine lining and the embryo is implanted. In addition, the trophoblast maintains the pregnancy by producing hormones and signaling molecules.

- Place: Mostly upper fundal area of the uterine posterior wall
- Time window: 6th day of embryonic development
- Process
    1. Docking: With the embryonic pole, the blastocyst attaches itself to the endometrium.
    2. Differentiation of the trophoblast
        - Syncytiotrophoblast: Multinucleated cell layer without cell boundaries (syncytium)
            - It arises from the fusion of trophoblast cells with the cells that are directly adjacent to the endometrium.
        - Cytotrophoblast: Cells that remain capable of division throughout the entire pregnancy and provide replenishment for the syncytiotrophoblast.
            - Located below the syncytiotrophoblast as a boundary to the embryoblast
    3. Invasion into the uterine lining
        - Infiltration of the syncytiotrophoblast into the compact zone of the endometrium using proteolytic enzymes.
        - The invasive penetration of the blastocyst into the stroma (interstitium) of the endometrium is also referred to as interstitial implantation.
        - By the end of the second week, the embryo is completely surrounded by the endometrium.

|Regulation of Implantation|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|β-HCG|   |- Produced by the syncytiotrophoblast<br>- Stimulation of the corpus luteum for progesterone production → Essential for maintaining pregnancy|
|Signaling molecules  <br>(e.g. Early Pregnancy Factor)|   |- Produced by the trophoblast<br>- Suppression of the maternal immune response so that the maternal organism does not reject the invading syncytiotrophoblast as "foreign"|
|MHC-I molecules|   |- Antigen presentation, present on the cell surface of all nucleated body cells as well as on platelets<br>- Absent on syncytiotrophoblast cells → Maternal immune system does not recognize these cells as foreign|

> [!NOTE]
> The embryo remains completely surrounded by endometrial tissue throughout the entire pregnancy!

> [!NOTE] Implantation bleeding
> The implantation of the blastocyst in the uterine lining may be accompanied by a slight bleeding, referred to as implantation bleeding. This can be mistaken for an early menstrual period.

> [!NOTE] Pregnancy certificate
> Starting from the 6th to 9th day, a pregnancy can be confirmed through a β-HCG test in serum. Additionally, a pregnancy test can determine pregnancy based on β-HCG in urine. Depending on the test, this determination is possible from about the second week after fertilization. The Early Pregnancy Factor can also be used as a pregnancy indicator within the first ten days of development.

## Multiples

Multiple pregnancies are, on one hand, a special event for expectant parents, while on the other hand, they also pose a particular challenge for midwives and doctors. It is important to distinguish between pregnancies with identical twins, which arise from the division of a fertilized egg into two embryonic structures, and pregnancies with fraternal twins, which occur through the fertilization of 2 eggs by 2 sperm.

### Identical vs. fraternal twins

| **Feature**                           | **Identical Twins (Monozygotic Twins)**                     | **Fraternal Twins (Dizygotic Twins)**                |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Frequency**                       | About ⅓ of all twin pregnancies                              | About ⅔ of all twin pregnancies                      |
| **Formation**                      | Division of a fertilized egg into two embryonic structures   | Fertilization of 2 eggs by 2 sperm                   |
| **Genetics of Individuals**        | Genetically identical individuals                            | Genetically different individuals                    |
| **Chorionic cavity and amniotic sac** | Different                                                    | Always dichorionic-diamniotic                         |

> [!NOTE]
> The frequency of a twin birth is 1:85, with fraternal twins occurring twice as often as identical twins!

> [!NOTE]
> Identical twins always have the same gender, only fraternal twins can also be of different genders!

### Birth Conditions of Identical Twins

| **Description**                       | **Time of Egg Division**                       | **Frequency in Identical Twins** |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Dichorial-diamniotic**            | Each identical twin has its own amniotic sac and placenta | Within the first 3 days after conception         | Approx. 29%                     |
| **Monochorial-diamniotic**          | The identical twins share a placenta but have their own amniotic cavity | Division occurs between day 3 and day 8 after conception | About 70%                      |
| **Monochorionic-monoamniotic**      | The identical twins share a placenta and amniotic cavity | Division occurs between day 8 and day 13 after conception | Approximately 1%              |
| **Monochorionic-monoamniotic (conjoined twins)** | The twins share a placenta and amniotic cavity and are fused together | Division from day 14 after fertilization              | Less than 0.1%                 |
### Complications and Mortality

Multiple pregnancies have an increased risk for a variety of pregnancy complications. Almost every feared complication has an increased risk in multiple pregnancies. Reasons for this include spatial confinement and increased hormone production. The risk of premature birth is significantly elevated.

- Increased maternal burden
    - Excessive pregnancy nausea (Hyperemesis gravidarum)
    - More frequent gestoses
    - Cervical insufficiency, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes
- Supply deficit
    - Placental insufficiency: Can lead to hypotrophy due to intrauterine malnutrition of one or both/all children.
    - Feto-fetal transfusion syndrome
        - Brief description: In monochorionic twin pregnancies, there can be placental connections between the two twins. When blood flows in a fixed direction from one twin to the other, a fetal-fetal transfusion occurs from the donor to the acceptor, putting both twins at risk.
            - The acceptor is at risk due to polycythemia. In a diamniotic pregnancy, the acceptor also experiences polyhydramnios.
            - The donor is at risk due to anemia, dehydration, and delayed growth. In a diamniotic pregnancy, the donor also experiences oligohydramnios.
- Birth complications in mother and child
    - Extended opening phase/birth process
    - Premature placental abruption after the birth of the first twin
    - Umbilical cord complications or umbilical cord entanglement by multiple umbilical cords
    - Uterine atony due to increased stretching of the uterus
- Abortion risk: Multiple pregnancies have a significantly higher abortion risk, so the frequency of multiple pregnancies is significantly higher than the number of multiple births. It is also possible for only one twin to be lost.
- Perinatal mortality: The perinatal mortality rate of twins is up to five times higher than that of singletons. In particular, the second twin is at risk.

> [!NOTE]
> Multiple pregnancies more often require delivery by cesarean section (C-section) due to the complicated birthing process!

## Review Questions on the Chapter From Fertilization to Implantation
### Fertilization

Where does the fertilization of the egg take place and within what time frame is this even possible?
- Fertilization of the egg usually takes place in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. Fertilization normally must occur within 24 hours after ovulation. Sperm are capable of fertilization for about 48 hours. The ideal conception period is therefore from two days before ovulation to one day after ovulation.
Describe the process of the so-called acrosome reaction!
- In the acrosome reaction, the membrane of the sperm initially fuses with the acrosomal membrane. Subsequently, hydrolytic enzymes (hyaluronidases) are released from the acrosome, which dissolve the cell connections between the corona cells so that the sperm can penetrate the corona radiata and reach the zona pellucida.
### Pre-implantation Phase

How do trophoblast and embryoblast develop?
- Through an influx of fluid into the blastocyst, a fluid-filled cavity forms between the outer and inner cell layers (blastocystic cavity). The outer cell layer differentiates into the trophoblast, the inner into the embryoblast.
What is meant by interstitial implantation and when does it occur?
- Interstitial implantation refers to the invasive penetration of the embryo into the stroma (interstitium) of the endometrium. This begins around day 6 after fertilization and is fully completed by the end of the second week of development. This means the embryo is then completely surrounded by endometrium.
How does the trophoblast further differentiate and what are the tasks of its "offspring"?
- The trophoblast further differentiates into syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast is a multinucleated cell layer (so-called syncytium) that arises through the fusion of trophoblast cells and is adjacent to the endometrium. Its task is the production of various hormones and signaling molecules (e.g., β-HCG); additionally, it initiates implantation into the endometrium. The cytotrophoblast lies beneath the syncytiotrophoblast, facing the embryoblast. It consists of mitotically active cells that supply new cells for the syncytiotrophoblast for the duration of the pregnancy. Together with the parietal layer of the extraembryonic mesoderm, the syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast also form the fetal part of the placenta.
When is it possible to confirm pregnancy using β-HCG?
- Detection of β-HCG in serum can confirm pregnancy as early as 6–9 days after fertilization. Detection of β-HCG in urine allows confirmation from about the second week post-conception.
How does a monozygotic, as well as a dizygotic twin pregnancy occur? What is the approximate ratio of monozygotic to dizygotic in relation to all twin pregnancies?
- A monozygotic twin pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg divides into two embryonic structures. A dizygotic twin pregnancy occurs when two eggs are fertilized by two sperm. About one-third of twin pregnancies are monozygotic twins, and therefore about two-thirds are dizygotic twins.
Identical twins can have different placental relationships. What is the most common and how is it characterized?
- In about 70% of monozygotic twin pregnancies, the two embryos/fetuses share one placenta but each have their own amniotic sac. This placental arrangement is called monochorionic-diamniotic.
