# Erythrocytes
## Summary

Erythrocytes (red blood cells) are the most common cells in the blood. Their main functions include the transport of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide. During their maturation, they lose all organelles and consist largely of the protein hemoglobin. Therefore, erythrocyte metabolism has some peculiarities: due to the absence of organelles, many metabolic pathways can no longer occur in them, which is why anaerobic glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate pathway are essential for them.

In this chapter, the general structure of erythrocytes, their production, and their metabolism are discussed. The exact process of gas transport in the blood, as well as the structure and function of hemoglobin, will be explained in the corresponding chapters.

## Profile

Erythrocytes make up the largest part of the blood cells. They are small cells that have lost almost all organelles and consist largely of the protein hemoglobin.

- Dimensions
    - Diameter: approx. 7.5 μm
    - Volume: approx. 90 fL
- Erythrocytes in the blood
    - Concentration in the blood: approx. 5 × 10^12/L blood (♂: 4.5–5.9 × 10^12/L blood, ♀: 4–5.5 × 10^12/L blood)
    - Total number in the blood: 24–30 × 10^12
        - Approximately 2 × 10^11 erythrocytes are produced daily.
    - Hemoglobin content (Hb) of the blood: approx. 15 g/dL
- Functions
    - Gas transport (O2, CO2)
    - Buffering of the pH value
- Lifespan: approx. 120 days

> [!NOTE]
> "3-rule": Red blood cells per liter multiplied by three gives the hemoglobin content per deciliter, multiplied by three gives the hematocrit. In men, all values may be slightly higher, while in women they may be slightly lower.

## Structure

### General Structure

Erythrocytes appear microscopically as red discs that are paler in the center than at the edge. The red color is due to the extremely high content of hemoglobin: it makes up about one third of the erythrocyte mass.

- Form: Biconcave disc (Thickness at the edge: approx. 2 μm, at the center: approx. 1 μm)
    - Highly deformable

> [!NOTE]
> Due to hemoglobin, erythrocytes are extremely rich in iron, with about 0.5 g per liter of blood – thus they contain over 50% of the body's total iron reserves (approximately 5–7 g)!

### Erythrocyte Membrane

- Lipid bilayer
    - Thickness about 10 nm
- Close connection with the cytoskeleton
    - Anchorage, among others, through the proteins glycophorin, band 3 protein, ankyrin
    - The malaria pathogen Plasmodium enters the erythrocytes through these proteins.
    - Crucial for the shape and stability (especially spectrin)

> [!NOTE] Defects of the erythrocyte membrane
> Inherited defects of membrane proteins can alter deformability and/or osmotic resistance. This can lead to hemolytic anemias, including hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis, where there is usually a hereditary defect of ankyrin. Typical consequences are hemolytic anemia and iron overload.

#### Blood Types

The different blood groups are based on surface antigens (so-called blood group antigens) in the erythrocyte membrane, which can trigger immune reactions. They are discussed in detail in the chapter on Blood and Blood Cells.

#### Special Features

- No expression of MHC class I
    - This implies the possibility of blood transfusions: only the blood types need to be compatible, not the MHC molecules.
- Aquaporin
    - Proteins that enable the diffusion of water
    - Erythrocytes respond quickly to changes in osmolarity
- Blood coagulation
    - Involved in the activation of coagulation factors
- Ion transport
    - Among other things, important for CO2 transport and buffering
    - Exchange of bicarbonate and chloride (so-called Hamburger shift)
## Erythrocyte Indices

The erythrocyte indices describe size (MCV), hemoglobin content (MCH), hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and the deviation of the mean erythrocyte size (RDW). They are routine parameters in the clinic and allow for, for example, the classification of anemias. For more information on erythrocyte indices as clinical parameters, see: Fundamentals of Hematology.

### Hematocrit (Hct)

- Hkt: The proportion of the solid components of the blood to the total volume is approximately 45%.

> [!NOTE]
> Normally, the hematocrit approximately corresponds to the proportion of erythrocytes in the blood volume, since white blood cells account for less than 5%. A low hematocrit indicates anemia. A high hematocrit increases blood viscosity and decreases, for example, the sedimentation rate!

### MCV

- MCV: Mean Corpuscular Volume ≈ 90 fL
- Meaning: Average size of the erythrocytes
- Calculation: MCV = Hematocrit/Erythrocyte count

> [!NOTE]
> 90 fl corresponds to normocytic erythrocytes. If this value deviates by at least 10% upwards or downwards, it is referred to as macrocytic or microcytic erythrocytes, respectively!

### MCH

- MCH: Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin ≈ 30 pg
- Meaning: Average hemoglobin content of the erythrocytes
- Calculation: MCH = Hb concentration/Erythrocyte count

> [!NOTE]
> 30 pg corresponds to normochromic erythrocytes. If this value deviates by at least 10% upwards or downwards, it is referred to as hyperchromic or hypochromic erythrocytes, respectively!

### MCHC

- MCHC: Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ≈ 330 g/L
- Meaning: Average hemoglobin concentration in erythrocytes
- Calculation: MCH/MCV

> [!NOTE]
> Since the MCHC is derived from the ratio of MCH/MCV, it remains normal in many disease states. For example: In iron deficiency anemia, less hemoglobin is produced (MCH↓), while the erythrocyte volume (MCV ↓) also decreases. The MCHC would therefore be within the normal range here. While it is usually provided, it is significantly less important than the MCV and MCH!

### RDW

- RDW = Red Cell Distribution Width = Red Cell Distribution Width = RCDB
- Meaning: Shows how differently sized the erythrocytes are
- Calculation: Standard deviation based on the MCV
- Physiological normal values up to 14.5%

> [!NOTE]
> The RDW is a nonspecific parameter for erythrocyte production disorders. An increase is referred to as anisocytosis; a common cause of this is iron deficiency anemia!

### Example Calculation: How many red blood cells does the human body contain?

- Specifications
    - In normal-weight individuals (for example, 70 kg), the blood volume accounts for 7% of body weight.
    - One microliter (or mm3) contains 5 million (= 5 × 10^6) erythrocytes, thus one liter (= 10^6 μL or mm3) of blood contains 5 × 10^12 erythrocytes.
- Invoice
    - 70 kg × 7% ≈ 5 L blood
    - Assuming there are 5 liters of blood and 5 × 10^12 erythrocytes per liter of blood, the total number of erythrocytes can be calculated as follows:
        - 5 × 10^12 erythrocytes/L × 5 L = 25 × 10^12 erythrocytes

### Classification of Anemias

Anemia (blood deficiency) is present when there are too few erythrocytes (erythrocyte count↓) or too little hemoglobin (hemoglobin concentration↓) in the blood. This can have many different causes, but even the values of MCV and MCH allow for a rough categorization.

|Microcytic hypochromic (MCV↓, MCH↓)|Normocytic normochromic (MCV→, MCH→)|Macrocytic hyperchromic (MCV↑, MCH↑)|
|---|---|---|
|- Iron deficiency<br>- Anemia due to chronic inflammation<br>- Tumor anemia|- Hemorrhagic anemia<br>- Aplastic anemia<br>- Renal anemia|- Vitamin B12 deficiency<br>- Folate deficiency<br>- Alcoholism|
## Life Cycle

### Erythropoiesis

The production of erythrocytes is referred to as erythropoiesis, while the production of blood cells in general is called hematopoiesis. The production of a single erythrocyte takes about 8 days; after approximately 120 days, it loses its function and is broken down. The following describes the exact process.

#### Place

After birth, erythropoiesis mainly takes place in the red bone marrow, while during embryonic development it shifts multiple times:

|3rd to 8th week of pregnancy|6th week of pregnancy to birth|10th to 28th week of pregnancy|from 18th week of pregnancy|
|---|---|---|---|
|Yolk sac|Liver|Spleen|Bone marrow|

> [!NOTE]
> Young liver synthesizes blood – yolk sac, liver, spleen, bone marrow!

> [!NOTE] Extramedullary hematopoiesis
> In cases of significantly increased consumption of erythrocytes (e.g., in thalassemia) or in diseases of the bone marrow (such as leukemias), there can also be blood formation outside the bone marrow in adults, i.e., primarily in the liver – this is referred to as extramedullary hematopoiesis.

#### Procedure

Erythrocytes are formed from multipotent stem cells in the red bone marrow. The synthesis occurs roughly in three steps.

1. Doubling of individual stem cells
2. Hemoglobin synthesis
3. Release of reticulocytes into the periphery

- Reticulocytes (from Latin reticulum = "the little net"): Direct precursor cells of erythrocytes
    - Features
        - Have already lost their nucleus but still possess a small amount of mRNA for final protein biosynthesis (especially for hemoglobin)
        - Allow conclusions about the activation of erythropoiesis

> [!NOTE]
> Mature erythrocytes have lost their organelles to make room for hemoglobin!

> [!NOTE]
> Reticulocytes are the only cells of erythropoiesis that physiologically occur in the peripheral blood. An increase in the reticulocyte count indicates enhanced erythropoiesis, while a decrease indicates disturbed erythropoiesis!

> [!NOTE] Reticulocyte count
> The percentage of erythrocyte precursors in the total number of erythrocytes in the blood is referred to as the reticulocyte count. The reticulocyte count is compensatorily elevated when more erythrocytes are destroyed (e.g., in hemolytic anemia) or lost due to blood loss. In contrast, if the blood production capacity of the bone marrow itself is impaired (e.g., in the context of aplastic anemia), the reticulocyte count is reduced.

#### Regulation

Erythropoiesis is influenced by the specific hormone erythropoietin as well as by some other hormones. The latter includes thyroid hormones (T3/T4), interleukins (e.g., interleukin-3), stem cell factors (SCF, stem cell factor), CSF (colony-stimulating factor), and sex hormones (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, etc.). If necessary, erythropoiesis can be increased tenfold.

- Erythropoietin (EPO)
    - Function: Stimulation of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow
    - Structure: Glycoprotein
    - Stimulus for synthesis: Renal oxygen partial pressure ↓ → Hydroxylases are inactivated → Transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) is no longer hydroxylated and consequently also no longer ubiquitinated → Proteasomal degradation of HIF ↓ → Intracellular HIF concentration ↑ → Transcription rate of the EPO gene ↑
    - Production sites: Peritubular fibroblasts of the kidney as well as hepatocytes

> [!NOTE]
> Fibroblasts in the kidney measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood. If this decreases, the transcription rate is increased by the transcription factor HIF and more erythrocytes are produced!

> [!NOTE] EPO and Anemia
> In the case of anemia, which is a decrease in hemoglobin levels, the EPO level in the blood is usually elevated compensatorily, leading to an increase in the reticulocyte count. An exception is renal anemia, which is caused by a lack of EPO. In this form of anemia, there is normochromic normocytic anemia with a decreased reticulocyte count.

> [!NOTE] Erythropoietin as a medication
> Erythropoietin can be produced recombinantly and used for the treatment of anemias. In particular, this represented a revolution in the treatment of renal anemia. Previously, treatment was only possible through regular transfusions with the resulting complications.

### Erythrocyte Breakdown

After about 120 days, the erythrocytes are broken down by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS).

- Sites of erythrocyte breakdown
    - Red pulp of the spleen approx. 55%
    - Liver about 40%
    - Bone marrow and peripheral approximately 5%
- Process
    - In the cells of the MPS (especially macrophages), the erythrocytes are broken down, releasing hemoglobin, which is then decomposed into its components during the breakdown of hemoglobin.
    - In addition to old erythrocytes, hemoglobin transported from the periphery is also broken down by the MPS.
    - The exact degradation signal has not yet been conclusively clarified; however, a reduced deformability of the old erythrocytes plays a crucial role.

> [!NOTE]
> Lifespan and synthesis of erythrocytes can vary significantly. For example, after a significant blood loss, the synthesis duration in erythropoiesis can be shortened!

## Glucose Metabolism of Erythrocytes

Mature erythrocytes lack cell organelles. This means that most metabolic processes do not occur within the erythrocytes, which is why they rely on glucose as an energy carrier. Furthermore, glucose also contributes to the production of NADPH and the synthesis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) via the hexose monophosphate pathway.

### Uptake and Metabolic Pathways

Erythrocytes take up glucose independently of insulin. It is primarily used for ATP production, but also serves for the generation of NADPH/H+ and for the synthesis of 2,3-BPG.

- Glucose uptake: GLUT1 transporter (insulin-independent)
- Metabolism
    - Around 90% in anaerobic glycolysis
        - Of this, 10% is diverted for the 2,3-BPG synthesis.
        - The remaining 80% is used for ATP production.
    - About 10% in the hexose monophosphate pathway

### Anaerobic Glycolysis

The anaerobic glycolysis serves to generate energy in the form of ATP and to produce the erythrocyte-specific molecule 2,3-BPG.

- ATP is required for:
    - The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase
        - Significantly involved in the erythrocyte membrane potential of -10 mV
        - Regulation of the water balance
    - Glutathione synthesis
- Emerging lactate is converted by liver cells (to a lesser extent also by kidney cells) into pyruvate, which is used for gluconeogenesis.

### Hexosemonophosphate Pathway (Pentose Phosphate Pathway)

The hexose monophosphate pathway primarily serves to generate reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH+H+ as well as riboses. The latter plays no role in erythrocytes, as they do not possess DNA or RNA. If the hexose monophosphate pathway is defective, this can lead to hemolytic crises (favism).

- Metabolism of glucose ("alternative pathway of glycolysis")
- Formation of the reducing agent NADPH
- Only source of NADPH for erythrocytes!
- Occurs in the cytosol
- Furthermore, the formation of ribose-5-phosphate: Important for nucleotide synthesis in other cells.

> [!NOTE]
> The hexose monophosphate pathway is the only source of NADPH+H+ for erythrocytes. NADPH+H+ is required for glutathione regeneration and the breakdown of peroxides!

> [!NOTE] Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency
> Glucose-6-Phosphat-Dehydrogenase is the key enzyme of the hexose monophosphate pathway. A deficiency of this enzyme is particularly noticeable in erythrocytes, which rely on the reduction equivalents produced in this metabolic pathway for protection against reactive oxygen species. The lack of NADPH leads to a decreased regeneration capacity of reduced glutathione, which in turn is not available for protection, for example, of hemoglobin from oxidation. Under cellular stress conditions, such as those that occur after the consumption of fava beans, peroxides are formed. Without sufficient amounts of reduced glutathione, these cannot be neutralized. Hemoglobin molecules cross-link with each other and form aggregates (so-called Heinz bodies). As a result, deformations and damage to the cell membrane occur, leading to cell lysis. Clinically, this can lead to a life-threatening hemolytic crisis (acute hemolytic anemia).

### 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate

2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) serves in erythrocytes to regulate oxygen affinity. Although it is derived from glycolysis, it primarily acts as a modulator of O2 binding by hemoglobin (allosteric effector) rather than for energy production.

#### Synthesis of 2,3-BPG

In glycolysis, 3-phosphoglycerate is produced from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) in the seventh reaction step, resulting in the formation of one molecule of ATP. For the synthesis of 2,3-BPG, this step is specifically bypassed in erythrocytes: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is diverted from glycolysis and converted into 2,3-BPG. It can later re-enter glycolysis through 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) or also as 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG), although no ATP is produced in this process.

- Reactions: 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) → 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) → 3-Phosphoglycerate + Phosphate → 2-Phosphoglycerate
    - Enzyme: Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) catalyzes all three reactions
        1. Isomerization of 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG
        2. Dephosphorylation of 2,3-BPG to 3-PG
        3. Isomerization of 3-PG to 2-PG
- Regulation
    - pH↓ → Less isomerization of 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG by BPGM with constant phosphatase activity → 2,3-BPG↓
    - At high altitude
        - Respiratory alkalosis (pH↑) due to hyperventilation; this increases the O2 affinity of hemoglobin and leads to a left shift of the oxygen-binding curve.
        - The 2,3-BPG level rises simultaneously and lowers the O2 affinity of hemoglobin, stabilizing the oxygen binding curve.
    - 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate lowers pH in erythrocytes (anion!) → Decreased 2,3-BPG synthesis (feedback)

> [!NOTE]
> The formation of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is catalyzed by bisphosphoglycerate mutase!

#### Functionality

2,3-BPG can bind to the central channel of hemoglobin, which forms between two β-chains. This channel is significantly larger in the low oxygen-affinity T state of hemoglobin than in the oxygen-affinity R state, so the binding mainly occurs to deoxygenated hemoglobin in the T state. This stabilizes hemoglobin in the T state and reduces the oxygen affinity (rightward shift of the oxygen binding curve).

- Binding
    - In the central channel of hemoglobin
    - Between β-chains
    - Mainly on Hb in the T-state
- Follow
    - In O2-poor tissue, hemoglobin is stabilized in the T state (does not transition to the oxygen-affinitive R state).
    - Decrease in the O2 affinity of hemoglobin
    - At the same time, in the CO2-rich tissue, the release of O2 is also facilitated by the low pH level.
## Glutathione

Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide. It is present in all body cells and can also be synthesized by mature erythrocytes, even though they lack a nucleus and rough endoplasmic reticulum. Its particularly high concentration in erythrocytes (about 2.5 mol/L) underscores its significance in cellular metabolism there.

- Structure: Tripeptide made of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine (therefore contains two amide bonds), where glutamate is linked to cysteine via its γ-carboxyl group rather than its α-carboxyl group!
    - This results in (at pH 7.2): A positive charge from the amino end (glutamate) as well as two negative charges from the carboxyl groups of glutamate and glycine.
    - Two glutathione molecules can be linked through their cysteine residues to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) by the elimination of hydrogen, i.e., they are oxidized.
        - Reaction: 2 GSH + NADP+ ⇄ GSSG + NADPH+H+
        - Enzyme: Glutathione reductase
    - The charges of the individual GSH molecules are not altered in this process (thus, the charges double: GSSG has four negative and two positive charges)
- Function
    - Generally: GSH is a reducing agent → Protection of the cell against free radicals/reactive oxygen species.
        - Example: Detoxification of peroxides (e.g. H2O2)
            - Reaction: H2O2 + 2 GSH → 2 H2O + GSSG
            - Enzyme: Glutathione peroxidase
    - Specifically in erythrocytes: Protection of hemoglobin from oxidation
        - Enzymatic: Methemoglobin reductase (NADH-dependent)
            - Reaction: 2 Met-Hb + NADH ⇄ 2 Hb + NAD+ + H+
        - Enzyme-independent through glutathione
            - Reaction: Met-Hb + 2GSH → Hb + GSSG
    - Outside the erythrocytes
        - Product of Phase II of biotransformation (here the substrate generally reacts with the SH group of glutathione)
        - Component of leukotriene C4
- Education: Through ATP-dependent synthetases (so-called atypical tripeptide)

## Review Questions on the Chapter Erythrocytes
### Property

What is the approximate diameter of a red blood cell? What is the term for an increase, as well as a decrease in diameter?
- Erythrocytes have an average diameter of approx. 7.5 μm. A decrease in diameter is called microcytosis, an increase is called macrocytosis.
How many erythrocytes are there on average in one μL of blood in a healthy adult?
- The concentration of erythrocytes is about 5 million/μL blood (= 5 × 10⁶/μL). They are by far the most common cells in the blood (approx. 99%).
How long is the average lifespan of a red blood cell?
- The lifespan of an erythrocyte is about 120 days.
### Structure

Describe the shape of red blood cells. How is it maintained?
- Erythrocytes have a biconcave shape. It is maintained by an intracellular spectrin network that is connected to the cell membrane via proteins (e.g., glycophorin, ankyrin). This confers stability and at the same time flexibility to the erythrocyte.
How much iron is contained in one liter of blood of an adult human on average? What is the proportion of iron bound to hemoglobin in relation to the total iron?
- The iron content in the human body is about 5–7 g depending on body weight. Slightly more than half is stored as hemoglobin in erythrocytes; one liter of blood therefore contains approximately 0.5 g of iron (about 3 g iron distributed over 5–6 liters of blood). The remaining iron is mostly present as storage iron (ferritin, hemosiderin), in myoglobin, and in enzymes.
Why can't a classic rejection reaction occur during blood transfusions, in contrast to organ transplants?
- The classic rejection reaction after an organ transplant is based on incompatibility of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I molecules on the surface of donor and recipient cells. All nucleated body cells and thrombocytes express MHC molecules – erythrocytes do not. Due to this particularity, compatibility of blood groups must be observed in blood transfusions, but not MHC compatibility.
### Erythrocyte Indices

What is hematocrit and how high is it normally?
- Hematocrit describes the proportion of solid components of the blood relative to the total volume and is approximately 45%.
How is anemia defined?
- Anemia exists when there are too few erythrocytes (erythrocyte count↓) or too little hemoglobin (hemoglobin concentration↓) in the blood.
Name the two most important erythrocyte indices for anemia classification and the formulas for their calculation!
- The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) describes the average size of an erythrocyte and is calculated by the formula hematocrit/erythrocyte count. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) describes the average hemoglobin content of an erythrocyte and is calculated by the formula hemoglobin concentration/erythrocyte count.
How do the erythrocyte indices change in iron deficiency anemia and how can this form of anemia be described further?
- Iron is essential for the formation of hemoglobin (Hb). If not enough Hb can be produced due to iron deficiency, the average Hb content per erythrocyte decreases and its volume decreases (MCH↓, MCV↓). Thus, erythrocytes are still sufficiently present but smaller and less intensely colored – this is also referred to as microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
What causes macrocytic anemia and how do the erythrocyte indices change?
- In macrocytic anemia, the number of erythrocytes is reduced, but hemoglobin synthesis is not impaired. The erythrocytes are therefore overloaded with hemoglobin (MCH↑) and enlarged (MCV↑). This anemia is triggered by a disturbance of erythropoiesis, as occurs for example with a deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12.
In which form of anemia do MCV and MCH remain unchanged? What are the causes?
- In normochromic, normocytic anemia, volume (MCV) and hemoglobin content (MCH) per erythrocyte are normal, yet the total hemoglobin concentration is reduced due to the decreased erythrocyte count. Typically, this occurs in acute bleeding or an EPO deficiency in the context of renal insufficiency.
### Life Cycle

What is erythropoietin (EPO) biochemically? Where is it produced and where does it act?
- Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein that is mainly produced in the kidney and stimulates erythropoiesis (formation of erythrocytes) in the bone marrow.
Through which mechanism can the EPO concentration be increased when needed?
- EPO production is regulated via oxygen-dependent gene expression of the EPO gene in the kidneys. A drop in arterial oxygen partial pressure (hypoxia) is detected by specialized fibroblasts in the kidney, which then increase the concentration of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). This acts as a transcription factor to raise the transcription rate of the EPO gene and thus increase EPO concentration. An increase in erythropoiesis in the bone marrow induced by EPO ultimately leads to an increase in arterial oxygen partial pressure.
What are reticulocytes and when is their number increased?
- Reticulocytes are the direct precursor cells of erythrocytes; they physiologically occur in peripheral blood. In the case of reduced erythrocyte numbers due to loss or destruction (e.g., hemolytic anemia, blood loss), erythropoiesis is compensatorily increased and the number of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood is accordingly higher.
### Glucose Metabolism of Erythrocytes

How is energy generated in erythrocytes and how does the starting material needed for this enter the cell?
- Because mature erythrocytes lack mitochondria (among other reasons to free up additional space for hemoglobin), energy in the form of ATP can only be generated anaerobically via glycolysis. They take up the glucose needed for this insulin-independently via the glucose transporter GLUT1 from the blood.
What is the goal of the hexose monophosphate pathway (pentose phosphate pathway) in erythrocytes?
- The pentose phosphate pathway, as a side pathway of glycolysis, metabolizes glucose to generate the reducing agent NADPH + H+. For erythrocytes, which require NADPH + H+ for glutathione regeneration and the breakdown of peroxides, this is the only way to obtain NADPH.
Which is the key enzyme of the hexose monophosphate pathway and what effects does a deficiency have in erythrocytes?
- The key enzyme of the hexose monophosphate pathway is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. If there is an enzyme deficiency, NADPH cannot be produced sufficiently. Erythrocytes depend on NADPH as protection against reactive oxygen species, so in situations of oxidative stress, deformation and damage to the cell membrane up to cell lysis may occur, with the risk of a hemolytic crisis.
In erythrocytes, in about 10% of cases, the ATP-generating step of glycolysis is bypassed. What reaction occurs instead and with what purpose?
- Besides energy generation, glycolysis in erythrocytes also serves the synthesis of 2,3-BPG (bisphosphoglycerate). In 10% of glycolysis cases, instead of the ATP-generating step, 1,3-BPG is converted to 2,3-BPG via bisphosphoglycerate mutase. 2,3-BPG in erythrocytes modulates oxygen affinity. It causes a right shift of the oxygen dissociation curve (lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin), thus facilitating oxygen release in the periphery to the tissues.
### Glutathione

Glutathione (GSH) consists of three amino acids: cysteine, glutamine, and glycine. Two GSH molecules can connect through cysteine.
- Glutathione is a tripeptide and consists of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Through the free SH group of cysteine, disulfide bridges (-S–S-) can be formed between two glutathione molecules (formation of GSSG).
What is the total electric charge of a glutathione molecule?
- A glutathione molecule carries an overall single negative charge. It bears a positively charged amino group (NH3⁺) on the glutamate residue and two negatively charged carboxyl groups (COO⁻) on the glutamate and glycine residues. The functionally important SH group in the side chain of the cysteine residue is uncharged.
What is the function of glutathione? Name an example of a reaction in which it is involved!
- Glutathione in its reduced form (GSH) is a reducing agent, i.e., it donates electrons in the reduction of free radicals by glutathione peroxidase. This enables reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to be converted into harmless compounds like H2O (H2O2 + 2 GSH → 2 H2O + GSSG).
What other function does glutathione have outside of erythrocytes?
- Glutathione is involved in biotransformation in the liver. Poorly excretable substances (e.g., paracetamol) are conjugated to the SH group of glutathione in the conjugation reaction, thereby making them water-soluble.
