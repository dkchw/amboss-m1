# Emotion and Motivation
## Summary

Emotions can be understood as the experience of sensory perceptions and consist of four different components: a physiological component, a feeling component, a cognitive component, and a behavioral component. Furthermore, a distinction is made between innate, primary emotions and learned, secondary emotions. With the help of emotion theories, an attempt is made to explain the emergence and perception of emotions.

Motivation refers to the inner drive of a living being to perform an action. It is influenced by the respective motives (reasons) of the living being. For example, the motive of hunger leads to the motivation to cook something. Similar to emotions, there is also a distinction between innate, primary motives and learned, secondary motives concerning motives.
## Basics of Emotions

Emotions can be understood as the experience of sensory perceptions. They arise, for example, as a result of external stimuli such as during a sad movie or through one's own thoughts about a happy coincidence. Emotions consist of several components, including physical signs (e.g., trembling when afraid) and a facial expression specific to the emotion, and can be divided into primary and secondary emotions.

### The four components of emotion

- Physiological component: Physical signs of emotion
- Emotional component: Personal feeling of the emotion
- Cognitive Component: Assessment of Emotion
- Behavioral component
    - Expression component: The experience of the emotion leads to an expression specific to the emotion in facial expressions, gestures, voice, and/or posture.
    - Motivational component: The experience of emotion leads to action.

### Primary and secondary emotions

One can distinguish between primary (innate) and secondary (acquired) emotions.

- Primary emotions (Basic emotions)
    - Are innate
    - The following emotions are referred to as primary emotions
        - Joy
        - Grief
        - Annoyance
        - Fear/Anxiety
        - Surprise
        - Disgust
    - The facial expression of the basic emotions is the same in all cultures.
    - Facial Action Coding System: Overview of the muscles involved in the respective basic emotions to recognize and differentiate between the various emotions.
- Secondary Emotions
    - If primary emotions are subject to social and cultural influences, they become secondary emotions.
    - Learned over the course of life
    - Mixed emotions of the primary emotions are also referred to as secondary emotions

> [!NOTE] Social smile
> The emotion "joy" is expressed through smiling or laughing. A social smile is referred to as a smile in response to the environment, particularly in reaction to faces and voices. It first appears about 6-8 weeks after birth.

## Emotion Theories

Using emotion theories, an attempt is made to explain the emergence and perception/interpretation of emotions. The many different theories differ in that each considers a different component of emotion to be decisive for its emergence and perception. For example, cognitive theories of emotion state that emotions only become perceived or relevant through a corresponding cognitive evaluation. In contrast, emotion theories that view the physiological component of an emotion as decisive assume that the experience of physiological changes leads to the emergence and perception of the emotion. However, the theories alone are not sufficient to satisfactorily explain emotions. Rather, it is helpful to consider and apply the different theories depending on the situation.

A detailed description of this model is provided in the chapter "Stress Models".                                                                             |

> [!NOTE] Anxiety Disorders
> The emotion of fear can also be pathological in nature. Patients suffering from a (specific) phobia experience fear exclusively or predominantly in clearly defined, actually harmless situations. For instance, a person with agoraphobia has a fear of going out alone and being in crowds. People with social phobia, on the other hand, avoid being the center of attention because they fear being critically evaluated by others and are afraid of embarrassing themselves. Patients diagnosed with a panic disorder suffer from sudden, episodic, recurrent panic attacks in nonspecific situations. Symptoms of such a panic disorder can include, for example, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, sweating, and chest pain. Characteristic of the panic attacks is the sudden ("out of the blue") onset of symptoms and their duration of about 5-10 minutes. The consequence of these nonspecific panic attacks is often a general avoidance behavior leading to social withdrawal and a decline in quality of life. In generalized anxiety disorder, the anxiety symptoms occur independently of the situation and, in contrast to a panic attack, present with varying characteristics and intensities as a subthreshold persistent state lasting for weeks to years.

> [!NOTE] Acute Stress Reaction
> A temporary psychological reaction to severe physical or emotional stress is classified as acute stress reaction. Typically, the symptoms begin shortly after the stressful event and subside relatively quickly. The acute stress reaction is therefore to be understood as a normal reaction to an "abnormal" experience.

> [!NOTE] Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
> A post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a reaction that can occur within six months after a traumatic, emotionally distressing event and is characterized by a disruption of self and world understanding. A typical symptom of PTSD is flashbacks. Patients experience the traumatic event again in thoughts, feelings, and images triggered by a key stimulus.

> [!NOTE] Secondary traumatization
> The concept of secondary traumatization is a relatively recent development in psychiatry, which is still controversial. It states that a so-called secondary traumatization can occur when someone is confronted with another person's trauma - for example, through physical presence at the site of the trauma or even just through the narratives of the primarily traumatized individual.

> [!NOTE] Depression
> Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with women being significantly more affected than men. In diagnosing, three main symptoms (depressed mood, loss of interest, and loss of drive) are distinguished from a range of other symptoms such as feelings of guilt, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, inner restlessness, and a feeling of inner emptiness. Additionally, in the context of a depression, patients may experience suicidal thoughts, which should always be openly discussed by doctors or therapists when there is suspicion. Although suicide attempts are more frequently made by women, completed suicides occur significantly more often in men.

## Motivation

The inner drive of a living being to take action is referred to as motivation. Motivation is influenced by the respective motives (reasons) of the living being. For example, the motive hunger leads to the motivation to cook something. The following will address some important aspects of motivation and its motives.

### Primary and secondary motives

One distinguishes between primary (innate) and secondary (learned) motives.

- Primary motives
    - Are evolutionarily conditioned and serve to preserve the individual or the community
    - Are divided into homeostatic and non-homeostatic motives
        - The primary homeostatic motives include, for example, hunger, thirst, sleep
        - Primary non-homeostatic motives include, for example, sexuality and curiosity.
- Secondary motives: Are learned over the course of life.
    - Secondary motives include, for example,
        - Achievement Motivation
        - Achieving social recognition
        - Acquisition of possession
        - Erlangen von Macht

### Hierarchy of Needs According to A. Maslow

A. Maslow defined the so-called hierarchy of needs (= pyramid of needs), which can be used to explain an individual's motivation for their actions. According to Maslow, humans go through the different levels of the hierarchy of needs in order and thus realize themselves more and more over time. However, not everyone reaches the final level. An important critique of this theory is that, in reality, levels can indeed be skipped. For even if biological needs are sometimes not met, an individual can very well strive for affection and attachment in their actions, for example.

- The following needs are sequentially fulfilled according to A. Maslow (from "base of the pyramid" to "top of the pyramid")
    1. Biological needs
    2. Need for security
    3. Need for affection and bonding
    4. Need for appreciation
    5. Need for self-actualization
    6. Need for Transcendence

### Motivation Conflicts

An individual is in a motivational conflict according to Lewin when two different forces of similar intensity act upon them, making the decision for or against a course of action more difficult. These forces can either consist of a desire (appetence) for something or a repulsion (aversion) against something.

- Appetence-Appetence Conflict: The individual must choose between two alternatives, each of which they desire.
- Aversion-Aversion conflict: The individual must choose between two alternatives, each of which they feel aversion toward.
- Approach-Avoidance Conflict (Ambivalence Conflict): The individual must weigh an alternative for which they feel both desire and aversion.
- Double appetite-aversion conflict (Double ambivalence conflict): The individual must choose between two alternatives for which they feel both desire and aversion.

### The Performance Motivation

The individual performance motivation varies greatly from person to person. It belongs to the secondary motives and describes the drive to do something better than before or in comparison to others.

#### Success-oriented and failure-oriented people

The achievement motivation is characterized on one hand by the hope for success and on the other hand by the fear of failure. Thus, depending on their characteristics, a distinction is made between success-oriented and failure-oriented individuals. The various attribution styles (causal attribution) and the choice of tasks (easy, medium, or hard tasks) are also differently pronounced among success-oriented and failure-oriented individuals.

- Success-oriented people
    - Are optimistic about their own performance
    - Suchen die Herausforderung, um sich zu zeigen, wie gut sie sind
    - Attribute successes more to internal and stable factors and failures more to external and variable factors.
    - Choose rather medium-level tasks that are realistic to accomplish, yet also provide satisfaction.
- Failure-oriented people
    - Are pessimistic about their own performance.
    - Act to prevent a feared failure
    - Attribute successes more to external and variable factors and failures more to internal and stable factors.
    - Choose rather easy tasks that are simple to accomplish or difficult tasks that others likely would not have managed either, which makes failure feel less negative.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Emotion and Motivation
### Basics of Emotions

Which are the so-called primary emotions (basic emotions)? What are they characterized by?
- The primary emotions are innate and can be reliably recognized in all cultures by characteristic facial expressions. The following emotions are included: joy, sadness, anger, fear/anxiety, surprise, and disgust.
Define secondary emotions!
- Secondary emotions are feelings that are learned over the course of life under social and cultural influences; these include, for example, feelings of envy and guilt.
What is the social smile and when can it be observed?
- A social smile is a smile that occurs as a reaction to the environment, especially to faces and voices. It can first be observed in infants at about the age of 6–8 weeks.

### Emotion Theories

What does the two-component theory by Schachter and Singer state in accordance with Lazarus's transactional stress model?
- The two-component theory by Schachter and Singer states that emotions arise and are perceived in two steps. First, there is the nonspecific perception of a physical reaction. In the next step, this is then cognitively evaluated unconsciously depending on the prevailing situation. Lazarus also emphasizes in his transactional stress model that emotions can only arise through cognitive evaluation.
Define specific phobia!
- A specific phobia refers to the fear of a clearly defined situation (e.g., fear of heights) or a specific object (e.g., spiders).
What is agoraphobia and what are typical consequences?
- Agoraphobia is a specific phobia in which those affected fear going out alone in public and entering crowds. As a consequence of this disorder, consistent avoidance behavior develops, and those affected rarely leave the house or only do so in company.
What characterizes a panic disorder and what are typical symptoms?
- A panic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks in nonspecific situations. Those affected suffer from sudden, paroxysmal symptoms such as shortness of breath, racing heart, dizziness, sweating, or chest pain, which last about 5–10 minutes.
In which mental illness do flashbacks typically occur?
- Flashbacks refer to sudden, intense memories of an experience, which are usually involuntarily triggered by a key stimulus (e.g., smell, voice). The term is mostly used in connection with re-experiencing traumatic events. Flashbacks are a typical symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which those affected relive the traumatic event again in thoughts, feelings, and images.
How can secondary traumatization occur?
- Secondary traumatization can occur when someone is confronted with another person's trauma, for example through presence at the trauma site or simply through the stories of the primarily traumatized.
Which gender is more likely to suffer from depression? What are typical symptoms?
- Depression is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses; women are significantly more affected than men. The three main symptoms of the illness are depressed mood, loss of interest, and loss of drive. Additionally, many other symptoms can occur, such as feelings of guilt, sleep disturbances, restlessness, or a sense of inner emptiness.
Describe the gender distribution in suicides or suicide attempts!
- Although women attempt suicide more often, the rate of completed suicides is significantly higher in men.

### Motivation

What is a motivation conflict in general, and what are an approach-approach conflict and an approach-avoidance conflict (ambivalence conflict) in particular?
- A motivation conflict arises as soon as two different forces of similar intensity act on a person and thus make the decision for or against a course of action difficult. An approach-approach conflict describes a necessary decision between two alternatives toward which the individual has a desire (= approach) (e.g., between two interesting evening events). An approach-avoidance conflict (ambivalence conflict), on the other hand, refers to a situation in which a person must weigh an alternative for which they feel both desire and aversion (e.g., a risky operation that promises improvement of a symptom).
Explain Maslow's hierarchy of needs and name the order of needs from the "base of the pyramid" to the "pyramid’s peak"!
- Maslow's hierarchy of needs defines a hierarchy of needs that can explain an individual's motivation for their actions. According to Maslow, a person goes through the individual levels of the hierarchy of needs in sequence and can only move to the next level when the needs assigned below are sufficiently satisfied. In this way, the person realizes more and more of themselves over the course of their life. The needs are: biological needs (e.g., hunger), need for safety, need for love and belonging, need for esteem, need for self-actualization, need for transcendence.
