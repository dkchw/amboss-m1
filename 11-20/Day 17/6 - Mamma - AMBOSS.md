# Mamma
## Summary

The female breast is composed of 10–20 gland lobes and the surrounding connective and fatty tissue. Each gland lobe contains numerous glandular end pieces, which converge through the milk duct system into a main milk duct and open into the nipple. In an active state, these glandular end pieces produce breast milk, which serves to nourish the infant and can also protect him from infections (the so-called "nest protection"). Additionally, the nipple has numerous nerve endings, which is why it plays a role in the sexual arousal of women. For more detailed information on lactation of the female breast, see: pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the breast in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the mammary gland.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Structure of the Mammary Gland

- Mammary gland
    - Organization into 10–20 gland lobes (lobes of the mammary gland)
    - Main excretory ducts of the gland lobes radiate into the nipple.
- Interlobular stroma: Connective and adipose tissue bed the glandular lobes.
- Nipple complex
    - Areola of the breast (Areola)
        - Surroundings of the nipple
        - Sharply defined area with darker skin pigmentation
        - Areolar glands (Montgomery glands): Small sebaceous/sweat glands
    - Mammary papilla (Nipple, Breast nipple)
        - Common opening of the milk ducts of the mammary glands
        - Rags normally hang above skin level.

### Topography of the Breast

- Mammary glands are paired along the ventral body wall at the level of the 2nd to 6th rib (variable) beneath the subcutis.
- They lie on the muscles of the ventral thorax.
    - 1/2 lies on the M. pectoralis major
    - 1/4 is located on the M. serratus anterior
    - 1/4 is located on the M. rectus abdominis

> [!NOTE]
> The position of the nipple can serve as a point of reference for the (slim) man: It is usually located in the midclavicular line and approximately at the level of the 5th rib. In women, this reference is less reliable due to the variable size and shape of the breast!

#### Bands

The mammary glands are attached to the skin and the chest wall by connective tissue strands.

- Suspensory ligaments of the breast (Cooper's ligaments)
    - Connective tissue strands radiating from the skin
    - Fixation of the subcutis of the breast to the thoracic wall

#### Fascia

The mammary glands lie directly on the thoracic fascia and are connected to it by loose connective tissue.

- Fascia: Moveable over loose connective tissue connected to the breast.
    - Pectoral fascia: Lies dorsal to the mammary gland.
    - Axillary fascia
    - Superficial abdominal fascia

### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Breast

The supply of the breast is provided by intercostal and axillary pathways.

- Vascular supply (Arterial and venous supply of the breast)
    - Arterial
        - Medial mammary branches of the internal thoracic artery from the subclavian artery
        - Lateral mammary branches of the lateral thoracic artery from the axillary artery
        - Rr. mammary of the posterior intercostal arteries (2nd–5th intercostal spaces) from the thoracic aorta
    - Venous
        - Internal thoracic vein into subclavian vein
        - Lateral thoracic vein into axillary vein
        - Intercostal veins in the azygos vein
        - Areolar venous plexus in the axillary vein
- Innervation (somatic/vegetative)
    - Supraclavicular nerves of the cervical plexus
    - Lateral and medial mammary nerves from the 2nd to the 6th intercostal nerves
- Lymph nodes of the breast
    - Cutaneous lymph nodes of the neck, contralateral breast, and epigastrium
    - Parasternal Lymph Nodes
        - Nll. parasternales along the internal thoracic artery
        - Drainage of the medial parts of the breast
    - Axillary lymph nodes
        - 75% of the lymphatic drainage of the breast
        - Quantity: 30–60
        - Classification into 3 levels depending on the position of the pectoralis minor muscle.

#### Axillary lymph node stations of the breast

The lymph drainage primarily occurs into the axillary lymph nodes, which are clinically very important in relation to the metastasis and prognosis of breast cancer.

|Axillary lymph node stations of the breast|Location|Regional lymph nodes|
|---|---|---|
|Level I|- Lower Axilla<br>- Lateral of the pectoralis minor muscle|- Paramammary lymph nodes<br>- Lateral axillary lymph nodes<br>- Pectoral axillary lymph nodes<br>- Subscapular axillary lymph nodes|
|Level II|- Moderate Axilla<br>- At the level of the M. pectoralis minor|- Central axillary lymph nodes<br>- Interpectoral axillary lymph nodes|
|Level III|- Apical Axilla<br>- Medial of the M. pectoralis minor|- Apical axillary lymph nodes<br>- Infraclavicular lymph nodes|

> [!NOTE] Lymphogenous metastasis of breast cancer
> The mammary carcinoma metastasizes early via the lymphatic vessels. Since most mammary carcinomas arise in the upper lateral quadrant, lymph node metastases are primarily found in the axilla on the same side. The so-called "sentinel lymph node" is the first lymph node in the lymphatic drainage of the tumor and is of great importance in the spread diagnostics of mammary carcinoma. If the sentinel lymph node is free of tumor, the tumor has generally not spread via the lymphatic vessels. In this case, the lymph nodes do not need to be removed during the surgery, and the further prognosis is good.

## Microscopic Anatomy

### Non-lactating (resting) mammary gland

The glandular lobes (lobes of the mammary glands) of the breast consist of numerous glandular lobules (lobules of the mammary glands), whose milk duct system merges into a main milk duct for each glandular lobe.

- Lobules of the mammary gland: Consist of glandular acini and surrounding connective tissue
    - Glandular ends: Site of milk production
        - Structure: Tubuloalveolar with a bilayered glandular epithelium
            - Inside: Cubical, apocrine gland epithelial cells
            - Outside: Myoepithelial cells
    - Intralobular stroma: Loose, cell-rich connective tissue (also known as mantle tissue)
- Milk duct system: Transport of milk from the terminal ducts to the opening in the nipple
    - Structure: Two-layered epithelium
        - Inside: Prismatic epithelial cells
        - Outside: Myoepithelial cells
    - Sections
        1. Terminal duct: Duct of a single lobule
            - Contains stem cells for proliferation during the remodeling to the lactating mammary gland.
        2. Lactiferous duct: Largest part of the milk duct system
            - Connects several terminal ducts with the main milk duct of the respective gland lobe.
        3. Lactiferous duct (main milk duct): Excretory duct of a lobe
            - Radiate towards the nipple and expand into the lactiferous sinus.
        4. Lactiferous sinus (milk sac): Enlarged terminal part of each milk duct with an opening into the nipple.
- Terminal duct-lobule unit (TDLE): Functional unit of the mammary gland and site of milk production
    - Consists of a terminal duct and the merging lobule, which is composed of several acini.

> [!NOTE] Breast cancer
> The mammary carcinoma is the most common malignant disease in women. Histologically, ductal (originating from the milk duct epithelium) and lobular (originating from the glandular lobules) carcinomas are differentiated based on the tissue of origin. The invasive ductal carcinoma occurs most frequently. The most significant risk factors include early menarche, late menopause, older age, and genetic factors. Therapeutically, the surgical removal of the tumor has the greatest relevance. If there is a favorable ratio between breast and tumor size, breast-conserving surgery is usually performed. Depending on the individual case decision, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and/or chemotherapy may be administered as well.

### Lactating Mama

Even during the first trimester of pregnancy, the transformation of the resting breast into the lactating breast occurs. The volume of the glandular tissue increases and the production of breast milk is initiated.

- Changes in the breast tissue
    - Enlargement and differentiation of the lobules of the mammary gland
    - Tubuloalveolar glands of the glandular end pieces begin with lactation.
    - Reduction of the intra- and interlobular stroma
- Hormonal regulation of glandular remodeling
    - Estrogen: Proliferation of the milk duct system↑
    - Progesterone and Prolactin: Differentiation and Proliferation of the End Pieces↑

> [!NOTE]
> Histological recognition features of the lactating mammary gland are the very large lobules with their tubuloalveolar terminal ends. There is only very little connective tissue between the lobules!

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the reduced stromal component, the histological preparation of the lactating mammary gland can be confused with that of the prostate or the parathyroid gland!

### Cycle- and Age-Related Changes of the Breast

The size and blood flow of the breast glands not only vary during the menstrual cycle but also change throughout a woman's entire life.

- Cycle
    - Increase in blood circulation throughout the cycle
    - Additionally, some women may experience an increase in size before menstruation.
- Puberty: See: Development of the glandular body
- In old age: Involution of the breast
    - Involution of the mammary gland from menopause onward
        - Atrophy of the glandular body and the fibrous stroma
        - The milk transport system remains intact.
    - Relative increase in fat content

### Development of the Mammary Gland

The mammary glands develop from the embryonic ectoderm initially as milk ridges. It is only at puberty that the maturation of the glandular tissue begins in women.

### Formation of the glandular body from the mammary glands

The milk lines are the precursors of the later mammary glands and develop from the 7th week as vertically oriented epidermal structures along the torso. The development of the breast proceeds identically in both sexes until birth.

#### Milk Lines

- Definition: Striped epidermal structure as a basis for multiple breast gland buds.
- Location: On both sides of the ventral torso between the groin and the axilla

#### Process of Glandular Body Development

1. Development of the mammary gland
    - Process
        - Thickening of the ectoderm (milk streak)
        - Thickening increasingly spreads into the subepithelial connective tissue and is then called the milk line.
2. Involution of the excess milk line portions
    - Process
        - Rapid complete regression of the mammary gland
        - Only one thoracic epithelial bud per side of the body remains in the area of the later mammary glands.
3. Outgrowth of the two epithelial buds
    - Process: The two remaining epithelial buds sprouted subepidermally → Formation of the first glandular lumens
4. Eversion of the nipple
    - Process
        - First, the nipple is at skin level.
        - Excretory ducts of the gland lumens are everted → Protrusion of the nipple above the skin level
        - Training and onset of pigmentation of the nipples and areolas

> [!NOTE] Accessory Mammary Glands
> If the regression of the milk line is disturbed and more than two epithelial buds remain, supernumerary nipples develop. If an developed gland body is additionally present, this is referred to as polymastia or ectopic breast.

### Maturation of the glandular body

With the onset of puberty, the development of the mammary gland continues in a sex-specific manner. The breast development of women during puberty is also called thelarche.

- Changes in the female breast during puberty
    - Tissue proliferation begins in the area of the areola with slight protrusion
    - Estrogen stimulates the increasing branching of the milk duct system

> [!NOTE]
> The man also has mammary glands (male mammary glands), which are fundamentally structured the same. However, due to the lack of hormonal influence from estrogen, they remain rudimentary. Men can therefore also be affected by breast cancer!

> [!NOTE] Hexenmilch
> Through the influence of maternal pregnancy hormones, the breast glands of the newborn child are also stimulated for lactation. The child's breast glands may be slightly swollen after birth and secrete a milky fluid known as "witch's milk."

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Breast
### Microscopic Anatomy

What are the histological characteristics of the non-lactating mammary gland (Gl. mammaria)?
- The tissue of the non-lactating breast consists histologically predominantly of connective and fatty tissue. Scattered within are numerous glandular lobules (Lobuli glandulae mammariae). Each of these glandular lobules consists of several tubuloalveolar end pieces made of two-layered cuboidal epithelium, whereby the outermost layer is formed by myoepithelial cells. The glandular lobule opens into a terminal duct. This is called a terminal duct-lobule unit (TDLE); it represents the smallest functional unit of the mammary gland and the site of milk production.
What changes histologically in the lactating breast?
- The transformation from the resting to the lactating breast occurs already in the first trimester of pregnancy. Histologically, there is an enlargement and differentiation of the lobuli glandulae mammariae as well as a reduction of the intra- and interlobular stroma. Finally, after birth, the glandular end pieces begin lactation due to the decline of placental hormones when the corresponding hormonal (e.g., prolactin, oxytocin release) and mechanical stimuli (suckling of the newborn at the breast) are present.
