# Renal Blood Flow and Glomerular Filtration
## Summary

One of the most important functions of the kidney is the filtration and excretion of waste substances with urine. Through ultrafiltration of the blood, the so-called primary urine is initially formed in the glomeruli of the kidney. Subsequently, the primary urine is processed into final urine through reabsorption and secretion processes in the tubule system (see: Tubular transport processes).

The kidneys are, in relation to their weight, the most perfused organs in the body, receiving about 20% of the cardiac output. This enormous blood flow allows for a large blood volume to be quickly cleared of nitrogenous metabolic waste products. Various regulatory mechanisms such as myogenic autoregulation, tubuloglomerular feedback, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and external mechanisms contribute to maintaining renal blood flow and, consequently, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) constant.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) describes the amount of plasma filtered per minute by all glomeruli in both kidneys. In a healthy adult, it is 120 mL/min. The GFR is an important parameter for assessing kidney function but cannot be measured directly. In clinical practice, the clearance of various marker substances (e.g., inulin) is used. This refers to a "fictional" plasma volume that is cleared of a substance within a certain time. Using clearance, the GFR can be indirectly determined, allowing for an assessment of kidney function.
## Urine Formation: From Primary Urine to Final Urine

Through the filtration of blood within the renal corpuscle, primary urine is initially formed. In this process, blood is pressed out of the convoluted capillary tuft, and the resulting primary urine is collected from the capsule space (glomerular filtration). The glomerular filter (composed of capillary endothelium, basement membrane, and podocytes) retains larger molecules and cells; thus, only smaller plasma components are released into the primary urine. In the next step, the primary urine is passed to the tubular system, where it is processed. Through complicated transport processes, about 99% of the primary urine is reabsorbed; the final urine is produced.

### Process of Urine Formation

- Place of education: Glomeruli and tubular system
- Principle of urine formation
    1. Blood flows through the renal vascular tuft.
    2. Filtration of the blood through the glomerular filter into the capsule space: Primary urine is produced (approximately 180 L/day)
    3. Primary urine flows through the tubular system and is "processed": final urine is produced.
    4. Endharn will be excluded.
- Advantages of this principle
    - Substances that must be excreted (uremic substances such as creatinine, for example) can leave the body in large amounts.
    - At the same time, water and electrolyte excretion can be adjusted to meet the needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Generally, it is the case that in the renal corpuscle, everything (except for macromolecules and blood cells) is filtered in large quantities, resulting in the formation of primary urine. In the tubular system and collecting duct, reabsorption and secretion processes occur, leading to the formation of final urine!

> [!NOTE] Proteinuria
> Normally, larger proteins cannot pass through the glomerular filtration barrier. However, if the glomerular filter is damaged, proteins can be filtered without obstruction and detected in the urine. A protein amount of 150 mg/24 h is referred to as proteinuria. Clinically, the patient may notice foamy urine. A urine test strip is used diagnostically to detect proteins in the urine. A more precise diagnostic method is the urine sediment or electrophoresis.

### Primary Urine

- Quantity: Approximately 1⁄5 of the blood plasma that has flowed through (about 180 L/day)
- Composition: Corresponds largely to that of blood plasma

> [!NOTE]
> Substances that are freely filtered (that is, dissolved, unbound, neutral substances) are present in the primary urine in the same concentration as in blood plasma. Macromolecules (such as plasma proteins) are, on the other hand, present in a higher concentration in the efferent vessel than in the primary urine, as they are not filtered, although fluid has been removed from the efferent vessel!

### Endharn

- Quantity: Approximately 1/100 of the primary urine volume (about 1.8 L/day)
- Composition: Very variable
    - Osmolarity: Between 50–1500 mosmol/L
    - pH value: Approximately 5.5 (between 4.5 and 8.2)
## Kidney Perfusion

In relation to their weight, the kidneys are the most highly perfused organs: they receive 20% of the cardiac output. This enormous blood flow allows for a large volume of blood to be quickly cleared of waste metabolic products. Various regulatory mechanisms help maintain a constant renal blood flow and thus also a constant glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Details on kidney metabolism are presented in exercise physiology (see: exercise physiology and aging → kidney metabolism).

- Pathway of blood through the kidneys: Renal arteries (Aa. renales) → Interlobar arteries (Aa. interlobares) → Arcuate arteries (Aa. arcuatae) → Interlobular arteries (Aa. corticales radiatae interlobulares) → Afferent arterioles (Vasa afferentes) → 1st capillary network: Glomeruli (filtration of primary urine) → Efferent arterioles → 2nd capillary network: Peritubular capillary system (nutrient supply to the kidney)

### Parameters of Renal Blood Flow

- Renal Blood Flow (RBF)
    - Definition: Amount of blood that flows through the kidney per minute
    - Quantity: About 1/5 of the cardiac output (approximately 1.2 L/min)
- Renal Plasma Flow (RPF)
    - Definition: Amount of blood plasma that flows through the kidney per minute
    - Calculation: RPF = RBF × (1-Hematocrit)
    - Amount: ∼600 mL/min

### Regulation of Renal Blood Flow

The kidney has the ability to maintain renal blood flow – and thus filtration performance – even with varying blood pressure conditions.

#### Myogenic Autoregulation (Bayliss Effect)

- Description: The renal arteries independently compensate for blood pressure fluctuations (between 80 and 180 mmHg).
- Mechanism
    - Blood pressure increase (up to 180 mmHg) → Increase in intravascular blood pressure → Contraction of the afferent arteriole → Decrease in blood pressure in the glomerular vascular bed → Blood pressure remains constant
    - Blood pressure drop (down to 80 mmHg) → Drop in intravascular blood pressure → Dilation of the afferent vessel → Increase in blood pressure in the glomerular vascular bed → Blood pressure remains constant

#### Prostaglandin

- Principle: Impaired blood flow (especially of the renal medulla) → Stimulates the synthesis of prostaglandins → Vasodilation of blood vessels → Increased blood flow, especially to the renal medulla

#### Tubuloglomerular Feedback

- Goal: Adjustment of renal filtration to tubular reabsorption capacity
- Mechanism: Macula densa in the distal tubule measures the salt concentration in the urine of the tubular lumen and adjusts the GFR of the individual nephron to the reabsorption capacity of the proximal tubule through local mechanisms.
- Procedure: Hypertonic urine → Release of adenosine → Afferent arterioles constrict (Adenosine acts vasoconstrictively via A1 adenosine receptors) → Capillary pressure decreases → GFR decreases

#### Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)

##### Goal

- Circulation: Increase in arterial blood pressure
- In the kidney: Maintenance of glomerular filtration rate during a drop in blood pressure

##### Involved Hormones

- Renin
    - Definition: Protease, which catalyzes the first reaction of the RAAS
    - Syntheseort: Cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (epithelioid Polkiss cells of the afferent arteriole)
    - Effect: Splitting of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I
    - Stimuli for renin release
        - Drop in blood pressure below the myogenic autoregulation range (i.e., below 80 mmHg)
        - Sympathetic activation
        - Hypovolemia
        - Hyponatremia
        - Hypotonic Urine
    - Inhibitory stimuli of renin release (in the sense of negative feedback)
        - Angiotensin II
        - Aldosterone
- Angiotensinogen
    - Definition: Glycoprotein; is cleaved from renin to angiotensin I within the RAAS.
    - Synthesis site: Primarily in the liver, adipose tissue
- Angiotensin I: Byproduct of angiotensinogen that is converted to angiotensin II by ACE
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
    - Definition: Protease; converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II
    - Synthesis site: Endothelial cells, mainly of the lung
- Angiotensin II
    - Definition: Is formed (catalyzed by ACE) from Angiotensin I and mediates an increase in blood pressure upon activation of the RAAS together with Aldosterone.
    - Molecular mechanism of action: Binding to the Gq protein-coupled AT1 receptor (syn. Angiotensin II receptor subtype 1)
    - Direct effect on the target organs
        1. Vascular: Vasoconstriction
        2. Central
            - ADH release from the neurohypophysis
            - Salt appetite↑
            - Durst↑
        3. Renal
            - Increased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule → Increased water reabsorption
            - Constriction mainly of the efferent arteriole → Despite reduced renal blood flow during systemic vasoconstriction, the GFR is maintained.
        4. Adrenal: Stimulation of aldosterone synthesis
    - Indirectly (via Aldosterone): Increased sodium and water retention as well as K+ and H+ secretion in the distal and connecting tubule as well as in the collecting duct.

> [!NOTE] AT1 receptor blocker
> AT1 receptor blockers (sartans) bind as antagonists to the AT1 receptor and thus inhibit the blood pressure-raising effects of angiotensin II. This principle is utilized in the treatment of arterial hypertension. The decreasing blood pressure leads to a compensatory increase in renin secretion and consequently an increased concentration of angiotensin II in the blood plasma.

> [!NOTE] COVID-19 and SARS
> Besides ACE, there is also the related protein ACE2, which is expressed similarly to ACE in various organs such as the lungs, kidneys, and heart. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and -2 bind to ACE2 via the so-called spike protein and thereby enter the type 2 pneumocytes, where they replicate and damage the alveolar epithelium of the lungs. Here, they cause the diseases SARS and COVID-19. In the case of a severe course of the disease, it can lead to respiratory failure requiring ventilation. In addition to the lungs, the viruses also damage other organs with ACE2 expression, so that an infection with SARS or COVID-19 can additionally lead to acute kidney injury.

##### Summary of the Mechanism

1. Renin release after stimulation by the above-mentioned factors (e.g. drop in blood pressure)
2. Renin splits angiotensinogen into angiotensin I.
3. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II.
4. Angiotensin II raises blood pressure and extracellular volume through the aforementioned mechanisms.

> [!NOTE]
> The RAAS is activated, among other things, when blood pressure or blood volume decreases. With the help of the enzymes renin and ACE, angiotensinogen is converted into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II leads, among other things, to an increase in blood volume and blood pressure through vascular tone, salt appetite, thirst, and renal reabsorption of sodium and water!

> [!NOTE] ACE inhibitor
> ACE inhibitors (e.g., Ramipril, Enalapril) inhibit the conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II and thus the blood pressure increase mediated by Angiotensin II. They are therefore among the first-line medications for arterial hypertension.

#### External Regulatory Mechanisms

##### Autonomic Nervous System

- Goal: Nervous Regulation of Renal Blood Flow
- Mechanism
    - Norepinephrine (NA): Via α1 receptors → Vasoconstriction of the arterioles → Increase in resistance → Blood flow decreases
    - Dopamine (DA): Through D1 receptors → Vasodilation of arterioles → Decreased resistance → Blood flow increases
    - When norepinephrine and dopamine act on the kidney simultaneously, the effect of norepinephrine predominates.

> [!NOTE] Acute kidney injury in shock
> In the case of significant blood loss, shock can occur: The arterial blood pressure drops significantly due to fluid loss. The sympathetic nervous system is activated, causing the blood vessels to constrict in order to maintain blood pressure. Due to the fluid deficiency on one hand and the high levels of catecholamines (especially norepinephrine) on the other hand, the kidneys are poorly perfused. Urine production decreases, and the patient excretes little to no urine – this is referred to as acute kidney injury.

## Kidney Function Parameters

### Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

- Definition: Describes the amount of plasma filtered by all the glomeruli of the kidney per minute.
- Quantity: Approximately 120 mL/min
- Course: The filtration performance of each individual glomerulus changes during the course of the glomerular vascular loop (decreases from the afferent arterioles to the efferent arterioles)

#### Determination of GFR

- Background: The GFR depends on three factors.
    - The effective filtration pressure Peff
    - The filtration area F
    - The permeability of the filter L
- Formula: GFR = Peff × F × L = Peff × Kf
- Decisive parameter: The effective filtration pressure Peff is the driving force of filtration.
- Definition of Peff: Peff = Pkap − Pbow − πonk → Peff = ΔP – πonk
    - Pkap: Hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries (capillary pressure)
        - Is influenced by vasoconstriction or vasodilation of the afferent and efferent arterioles of the kidney.
    - Pbow: Hydrostatic pressure in the Bowman capsule (capsule pressure)
        - Is influenced by the hydrostatic pressure of the subsequent tubular sections
    - ΔP: Difference between Pcap and Pbow
    - πonk: Oncotic pressure in the capillaries
- Clinical assessment of GFR
    - CKD-EPI formula
        - Considered factors: Serum creatinine, age, gender, ethnicity ("Race")
        - Unit of the result: mL/min/1.73 m2
    - MDRD formula
        - Considered factors and unit as in the CKD-EPI formula
    - Cockcroft-Gault formula: eGFR ≈ [(140−age) × body weight in kg] / [72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL]
        - For women, the result must still be multiplied by 0.85
        - Considered factors: Serum creatinine, age, gender, body weight
        - Unit of the result: mL/min

#### Filtration Equilibrium

Towards the end of the capillary path, a so-called filtration equilibrium can be established, which leads to no further filtration. It occurs when ΔP (Pcap - Pbow) and πonk come so close together that their difference Peff - and thus the driving force of filtration - approaches zero.

> [!NOTE]
> The effective filtration pressure (Peff) decreases along the glomerular capillary and approaches zero towards the end - a filtration equilibrium is established!

#### Relationship between kidney filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF)

- Requirements
    - The higher the renal plasma flow (i.e., the kidney blood flow), the more the filtration equilibrium is shifted towards the end of the capillary.
    - The further the filtration equilibrium shifts towards the end of the capillary, the larger the available filtration area.
    - The larger the filtration area F, the larger the GFR (since it holds: Peff × F↑ × L = GFR↑)
- Result: The filtration performance of the kidney (GFR) is proportional to the renal plasma flow (RPF): The greater the renal plasma flow, the greater the filtration performance of the kidney.

### Renal Clearance

- Definition: Describes the "fictional" plasma volume that is cleared of a substance by the kidneys within a specific time.
- Features
    - Does the unit of a river have (Volume/Time)
    - Always applies only to one substance
    - The clearance of a substance and the GFR are not necessarily equal.
- Interpretation
    - The clearance is greater than the GFR when the substance is initially freely filtered and then additionally secreted.
    - The clearance is smaller than the GFR when the substance is initially freely filtered and then reabsorbed.
    - Clearance is equal to GFR when the substance is freely filtered and excreted without modification.
- Calculation: Clearance (mL/min) = Substance concentration in urine (mmol or g/mL) × Urine time volume V (mL/min) / Substance concentration in plasma (mmol or g/mL)
- Example calculation: ClearanceInulin = Urine concentration Inulin 2 g/L × Urine time volume 5 mL/min / Plasma concentration Inulin 0.1 g/L = 0.002 g/mL × 5 mL/min / 0.0001 g/mL = 100 mL/min

> [!NOTE]
> Low clearance values mean that the plasma has been only slightly cleared of a certain substance - high clearance values mean that the plasma has been largely cleared of that substance!

#### Clearance behavior of important substances

##### Glucose

- Clearance behavior: Glucose is completely freely filtered and fully reabsorbed in the tubular system under normal conditions and is not secreted.
- Clearance value: 0 mL/min (under normal conditions)
- Clearance value dependent on the plasma concentration of the substance: Yes
- Urine concentration
    - Under normal conditions, no glucose can be detected in the urine.
    - After exceeding the renal threshold for glucose (10 mmol/L or 180 mg/dL), the glucose concentration rises linearly.
- Physiological explanation: Up to the renal threshold, it does not matter how much glucose is in the blood; it is completely reabsorbed. The plasma volume is therefore not "cleared" of glucose; the clearance is zero. However, when the renal threshold is exceeded, glucose is increasingly excreted in the urine. From this point on, the urine concentration rises (more or less) in proportion to the plasma concentration. The clearance also initially increases proportionally with the plasma glucose concentration until it approaches the GFR – more volume than the GFR cannot be cleared per minute (unless the substance is secreted tubularily, which is not the case for glucose).

##### Inulin

- Clearance behavior: Inulin is completely freely filtered, neither reabsorbed nor secreted → thus, the inulin clearance corresponds to the GFR.
- Clearance value: 120 mL/min
- Clearance value dependent on the plasma concentration of the substance: No
- Urine concentration: Increases proportionally with plasma concentration
- Physiological explanation: Regardless of how high the inulin concentration in plasma is, the clearance of this substance always corresponds to the GFR. Proportionally, the same amount is excreted at high plasma inulin concentration as at low plasma concentration – thus, if there is more inulin in the plasma, more will also be excreted with the urine.

##### Paraaminohippurate (PAH)

- Clearance behavior: PAH is freely filtered, not reabsorbed, and completely secreted.
- Clearance value: Approx. 650 mL/min (maximally as high as the renal plasma flow)
- Clearance value dependent on the plasma concentration of the substance: Yes
- Urine concentration: Initially increases disproportionately, then becomes proportional with increasing plasma concentration.
- Physiological explanation: At low plasma concentration, the entire plasma volume is "cleared" of PAH – everything that has not already been filtered in the glomerulus is secreted at the latest in the tubular system. However, from a certain plasma concentration onwards, saturation of the secretion mechanisms occurs, which is why not the entire plasma volume flowing through the kidney can be "cleared" of PAH anymore.

##### Clinical Application: Creatinine

- Clearance behavior: Creatinine is completely freely filtered, not reabsorbed, and secreted in small amounts tubularly.
- Clearance value: approx. 120 mL/min
- Special feature: Creatinine is used in clinical practice to assess kidney function (normal value for serum creatinine ≤0.9 mg/dL (♀) and ≤1.1 mg/dL (♂)):
    - Has a similar clearance behavior as inulin; thus, it is well-suited for assessing GFR.
    - Disadvantage: Blood creatinine levels depend (aside from kidney function) on muscle metabolism.
    - Advantage: Creatinine is a substance produced by the body during muscle metabolism and does not need to be infused into the body like inulin.

> [!NOTE] GFR and creatinine clearance in the clinic
> The GFR is an important parameter for assessing kidney function. Various diseases (e.g., a glomerulonephritis) lead to the destruction of the glomeruli over time, resulting in a decrease in GFR and thus an accumulation of waste substances in the blood. Since GFR cannot be determined directly, creatinine clearance is usually taken as a measure of GFR. Creatinine is continuously produced by the body, glomerularly filtered, not reabsorbed, and only secreted in very small amounts. The concentration should therefore remain constant and indirectly provides clues about the GFR. The GFR can be calculated using the so-called CKD-EPI formula based on age, gender, ethnicity ("Race"), and serum creatinine. However, a disadvantage is that serum creatinine only increases after a reduction in GFR of over 50%. A lesser reduction in GFR is not measurable; it lies in the so-called “creatinine-blind” range.

#### Free Water Clearance

- Definition: Formation of electrolyte-free water by the kidneys to regulate renal water excretion in response to altered plasma osmolality (particularly due to altered sodium concentration).
    - Unit: mL/min
    - Reference value plasma osmolality: 290 mosmol/kg
- Interpretation: Assessment of the kidney's ability to concentrate urine
    - Free water clearance negative: The free water clearance is typically negative because the urine is hyperosmolar compared to plasma.
    - Positive free water clearance: In this case, the urine is hypotonic compared to plasma.
- Calculation: Free water clearance cH2O = Urine volume per time VU (mL/min) × 1 – (Urine osmolality Uosm/[Plasma osmolality Posm)]
- Example calculation: cH2O = 5 mL/min × [1 – (180 mosmol/kg / 300 mosmol/kg)] = 5 mL/min × [1 – 0.6] = 5 mL/min × 0.4 = 2 mL/min

### Fractional Excretion (FE)

- Definition
    - The fractional excretion indicates the proportion of a filtered substance X that is actually excreted with the urine.
    - It corresponds to the ratio of the clearance of a specific substance to the GFR.
- Interpretation
    - FA <1: Lower excretion (e.g. of water, glucose, amino acids, sodium, chloride)
    - FA >1: Higher excretion (e.g. in the case of organic anions and cations such as para-aminohippurate (PAH) or atropine)
- Example calculation: Out of 180 liters of glomerular filtered primary urine, ultimately 1.5 liters of water are excreted with the urine. This corresponds to a fractional excretion of 1.5/180 ≈ 0.01 (which means that only about 1% of the filtered water is actually excreted).
## Review Questions on the Chapter Renal Blood Flow and Glomerular Filtration
### Urine Formation: From Primary Urine to Final Urine

Explain the principle of urine formation!
- Urine is formed through filtration, reabsorption, and secretion in the kidney. In the first step, blood is filtered in the renal glomerulus. About 180 L of the so-called primary urine are formed per day. It has approximately the same composition as blood plasma. The primary urine flows through the tubular system as well as the collecting duct of the kidney, during which 99% of the water and dissolved particles are reabsorbed. Some substances are secreted into the forming final urine. Thus, about 1.8 L of final urine are produced per day.
Are bound and unbound substances present in the primary urine in the same concentration as in blood plasma?
- Substances not bound to proteins, i.e., dissolved and uncharged in plasma, are freely filtered in the glomerulus and are therefore present in the same concentration both in plasma and in the primary urine. Larger molecules such as proteins are retained by the glomerular filter and thus occur in higher concentration in the blood plasma than in the primary urine.
Between which values can the osmolarity of the final urine fluctuate?
- Depending on how concentrated the final urine is, the osmolarity fluctuates between 50 and 1,500 mosmol/L. The higher the osmolarity, the more concentrated the final urine is.
### Kidney Perfusion

What parameters of renal blood flow do you know? How are they calculated?
- Renal blood flow is described by the amount of blood or plasma that flows through the kidney per minute. A distinction is made between renal blood flow (RBF) and renal plasma flow (RPF). The RBF is about 20% of the cardiac output, i.e., approximately 1.2 L/min. The RPF is determined using RBF and hematocrit (Hkt). It holds that RPF = RBF × (1 - Hkt).
What does the Bayliss effect describe and where does it occur?
- The Bayliss effect describes the myogenic autoregulation of the kidneys and ensures constant renal blood flow. Blood pressure fluctuations between 80 and 180 mmHg are compensated by contraction or dilation of the afferent arterioles to keep the blood pressure in the glomeruli, and thereby the filtration pressure and GFR, constant.
Where is renin produced and what does it do?
- Renin is produced in specialized cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, also called epitheloid polkiss cells, located in the afferent arteriole. As a protease, renin cleaves angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II by ACE through proteolytic cleavage. Angiotensin II, together with aldosterone, mediates an increase in systemic blood pressure.
How is the secretion of renin regulated?
- Renin is increasingly secreted when blood pressure falls below the kidney’s autoregulation range of 80 mmHg. Additionally, sympathetic activation, hypovolemia, and hyponatremia act as positive stimuli for release. Angiotensin II and aldosterone inhibit secretion via negative feedback.
Where is angiotensinogen produced?
- Angiotensinogen is a glycoprotein produced in the fat cells of the liver.
Which receptors does Angiotensin II bind to and what effects does this have?
- Angiotensin II binds to angiotensin II receptors (AT receptors). Binding to the AT1 receptor causes vasoconstriction. Centrally, it increases thirst and salt appetite as well as ADH secretion. In the kidney, it leads to increased water and sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubular system. In the adrenal cortex, it stimulates aldosterone synthesis. These mechanisms increase the extracellular volume, which together with vasoconstriction leads to increased vascular resistance and thus elevated blood pressure.
In the treatment of hypertension, AT1 receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors are used, among other things. What compensatory mechanism do they induce in the kidney?
- AT1 antagonists and ACE inhibitors lower systemic blood pressure by inhibiting angiotensin II. The consequent reduced renal perfusion leads compensatorily to increased renin secretion.
What effect does norepinephrine have on kidney blood flow?
- By binding to α1 receptors, norepinephrine causes vasoconstriction of smooth vascular muscle cells, i.e., resistance in the kidney’s vessels increases and the kidneys are less perfused.
### Kidney Function Parameters

What is meant by the glomerular filtration rate?
- The amount of plasma filtered per minute is called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It usually amounts to 120 mL/min and corresponds to the amount of primary urine produced per minute.
With which formula commonly used in clinical practice can the GFR be approximately determined?
- The so-called CKD-EPI formula is recommended for estimating GFR; it takes into account age, gender, ethnicity ("race"), and serum creatinine. Since the CKD-EPI formula is quite complicated and results cannot be calculated mentally, in clinical practice the (no longer recommended) Cockcroft-Gault formula is occasionally still used: GFR ≈ [(140 − age) × body weight in kg] / [72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL] (for women, additionally multiplied by a factor of 0.85).
Is the effective filtration pressure along the glomerular capillary consistent?
- The effective filtration pressure is a pressure difference that describes fluid transport through the capillary wall. It decreases along the glomerular capillaries and approaches zero at their end because a filtration equilibrium is established.
What is meant by the so-called clearance and how is it calculated?
- Clearance is the amount of “hypothetical” plasma volume from which a certain substance is cleared per minute. It is calculated by this formula: Clearance = concentration of substance in urine × urine volume per time / concentration of substance in plasma. If clearance is low, only a small portion of the plasma was cleared of the substance. If clearance is high, most of the plasma was cleared.
Which laboratory value can be used as an approximation for GFR? Why?
- Creatinine is freely filtered in the glomerulus and passes through the tubular system largely unaltered (not reabsorbed, minimally secreted). Since it is always present in the body, it can clinically be used as an approximation of the inulin clearance (freely filtered, not reabsorbed, not secreted) to determine GFR.
What is the clearance behavior of para-aminohippuric acid?
- Para-aminohippuric acid is freely filtered in the glomeruli, not reabsorbed, and completely secreted. The clearance value depends on plasma concentration: the lower it is, the better the plasma clearance of para-aminohippuric acid. When plasma concentration rises, secretion mechanisms become saturated, so clearance decreases.
Why is the clearance value for glucose under normal conditions 0 mL/min? When is it no longer?
- Glucose is freely filtered in the glomerulus, but then completely reabsorbed in the tubular system, so final urine normally contains no glucose. If plasma glucose exceeds 10 mmol/L or 180 mg/dL, glucose concentration in the final urine rises linearly. This is called exceeding the renal threshold.
Explain the term free water clearance and state its plasma reference value!
- Free water clearance denotes the amount of water excreted or reabsorbed by the kidney to regulate urine osmolality. With the free water clearance, the kidney’s ability to concentrate urine can be assessed. The plasma osmolality reference value is 290 mosmol/kg. Normally, urine is hyperosmolar compared to blood plasma, i.e., free water clearance is negative. With impaired concentrating ability, urine is hypoosmolar, and free water clearance is positive, i.e., more water is excreted than required given the osmotically active substances in urine.
How is the free water clearance calculated?
- The formula for free water clearance is CH2O = urine volume per time (VU) × [1 - (urine osmolality Uosm / plasma osmolality Posm)].
Explain the term fractional excretion!
- Fractional excretion refers to the proportion of a filtered substance that is actually excreted in the urine. It describes the ratio of the clearance of a particular substance to the GFR.
