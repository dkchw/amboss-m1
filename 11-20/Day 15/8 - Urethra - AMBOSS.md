# Urethra
## Summary

The urethra connects the bladder to the outside world and is significantly longer in men, measuring about 20 cm due to its course through the penis, compared to 3–5 cm in women. The main function of the urethra is to conduct urine (see: bladder emptying) and additionally, in men, to transport sperm during ejaculation. Along its course, several small glands also open into the lumen of the urethra in men. The development of the urethra is discussed alongside the development of the bladder. By the way, you will also find a histo trainer episode on the urinary tract in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the urethra.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function: Urine excretion (♀/♂) and sperm transport (♂)
- Course
    - ♀: Subperitoneal from the bladder to the vaginal vestibule
    - ♂: Subperitoneal from the bladder through the prostate and pelvic floor to the penis
- Length: ♀ 3–5 cm, ♂ approx. 20 cm

> [!NOTE] Urethra feminina
> The shortness of the female urethra promotes ascending infections of the bladder (cystitis) and the renal pelvis (pyelonephritis), which actually occur much more frequently in women than in men. In contrast, urinary retention is rarely seen in women. Additionally, catheterization of the bladder is significantly easier in women due to the shortness of the urethra compared to men.

### Structure of the Urethra

- Urethral entrance and exit
    - Internal urethral orifice: Entrance of the urethra into the bladder with M. sphincter urethrae internus (internal urethral sphincter)
    - External urethral orifice: Exit of the urethra at the body surface
        - ♂ Slit-shaped, opening at the apical glans penis
        - ♀ Point-like, opens into the vestibule of the vagina between the clitoris and the vagina

#### Sections of the Urethra

##### Urethral sections of the woman

1. Intramural part of the urethra: Short section within the wall of the bladder (<1 cm)
    - Dorsally running urethral crest
2. Membranous part of the urethra: Section in the subperitoneal connective tissue (1–2 cm)
    - Openings of the execution ducts of the urethral glands (for detailed information see: urethral glands)
    - Passage through the urogenital diaphragm with M. sphincter urethrae externus (external urethral sphincter, voluntarily innervated)

##### Urethral Sections of the Male

1. Intramural part of the urethra: See above
2. Prostatic part of the urethra: Section within the prostate (approximately 3 cm)
    - Dorsally running urethral crest
    - Contains the colliculus seminalis (seminal colliculus): continuation of the crista urethralis
    - The following structures flow into here:
        - Prostatic ducts: Excretory ducts of the prostate (open laterally into the colliculus)
        - Ejaculatory ducts (open on both sides dorsally into the colliculus)
        - Prostatic utricle: Blind sac as a remnant of the embryonic Müllerian duct (opens centrally into the colliculus)
3. Membranous part of the urethra: See above
4. Spongy part of the urethra: section within the corpus spongiosum of the penis (approximately 15 cm)
    - Opening of the two ducts of the bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands) into the urethral ampulla
    - Navicular fossa: Dilatation of the urethra at the glans of the penis

#### Narrow and wide areas along the male urethra

- Bottlenecks
    1. In the course through the bladder wall near the ostium urethrae internum (in the intramural part)
    2. Upon passing through the pelvic floor in the membranous part (this is the narrowest point of the urethra)
    3. At the slit-shaped external urethral orifice
- Wide Areas
    1. Prostatic part
    2. Ampulla of the urethra (transition to the bulb of the penis)
    3. Navicular fossa

> [!NOTE] Male bladder catheterization
> The catheterization of the bladder is usually somewhat more difficult in men than in women. The reason for this is that the male urethra is longer and has a more complex course with constrictions. When inserting the catheter, the penis must first be stretched and then, upon reaching the membranous part, bent downward to follow the physiological course.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Urethra

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. urethralis from the A. pudenda interna<br>- Additionally in men: Small branches from Rr. prostatici of the A. vesicalis inferior|
|Venous|- Venous plexus of the bladder into the internal iliac vein<br>- Additionally in men<br>    - Prostatic venous plexus into the internal iliac vein<br>    - Penile veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Sensory|- Pudendal Nerve|
|Sympathetic|- Sacral splanchnic nerves of the inferior hypogastric plexus|
|Parasympathetic|- Pelvic splanchnic nerves|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Lumbar nodes → Internal iliac nodes/Inguinal nodes|
## Microscopic Anatomy

- Mucous membrane
    - Mucosa with longitudinal folds (star-shaped lumen in cross-section)
    - Three different types of epithelium with sex-dependent different boundaries → see: Urethral epithelium in females vs. Urethral epithelium in males
        - Urethral epithelium in women: the transitions of the epithelium are fluid.
            - Upper third: Urothelium
            - Middle third: Stratified columnar epithelium
            - Lower third: Multilayered non-keratinized squamous epithelium
        - Urethral epithelium in men: transitions clearly marked
            - Intramural part + Prostatic part: Urothelium
            - Membranous part + Majority of the spongy part: Stratified columnar epithelium
            - From the navicular fossa: Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
    - Lamina propria: Connective tissue layer with pronounced vascular plexuses (=Tunica spongiosa)
- Tunica muscularis: Smooth muscle arranged in a spiral configuration
    - M. sphincter urethrae externus: Continence-maintaining muscle in the area of the membranous part of the urethra (pelvic floor)
        - External striated part: M. sphincter urethrae transversostriatus
        - Inner circular smooth muscle component: M. sphincter urethrae glaber
- Tunica adventitia: Surrounding connective tissue layer
## Urethral Glands

### Urethral Glands ♂ & ♀ (Littré Glands)

- Location: Endoepithelial tubular mucous glands in the distal part of the urethra
- Size: Pinhead-sized
- Mouth
    - ♀: Distal Membranous Part
    - ♂: In the urethral lacunae
- Function: Production of slimy lubricating fluid and thereby lubrication of the urethra

> [!NOTE] Infection of the urethral glands
> In infections of the urethra, the urethral glands are usually infected early. Particularly in the case of a gonococcal infection, prolonged inflammation can occur.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Urethra
### Macroscopic Anatomy

How long are the male and female urethras, approximately?  
- The female urethra is significantly shorter at 3–5 cm in length compared to the approximately 20 cm long male urethra.  
List the sections of the male urethra in their order from proximal to distal!  
- The male urethra is divided from proximal to distal into the following sections: Pars intramuralis urethrae, Pars prostatica urethrae, Pars membranacea urethrae, and Pars spongiosa urethrae.  
Name the constrictions and expansions of the male urethra! Which is the widest and which is the narrowest point?  
- The male urethra has three constrictions: near the Ostium urethrae internum, at the passage through the pelvic floor in the Pars membranacea (this is the narrowest point of the urethra), and at the slit-shaped Ostium urethrae externum. The three expansions are the Pars prostatica, the Fossa navicularis, and the Ampulla urethrae, the latter being the widest point of the urethra.  
Which glandular excretory ducts open into the ampulla urethrae?  
- The Ampulla urethrae is located in the Pars spongiosa of the male urethra and is one of its wide areas. The ducts of the Glandulae bulbourethralis (Cowper's glands) open into it.
