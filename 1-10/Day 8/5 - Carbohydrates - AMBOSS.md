# Carbohydrates
## Summary

Carbohydrates are the most important energy carriers of the human body. They are chemically composed of monosaccharides (simple sugars), which can polymerize into di- or polysaccharides (disaccharides and oligosaccharides). Carbohydrates ingested with food are broken down into monosaccharides in the mouth and small intestine, absorbed through special transporters, and transported to the body cells for further metabolism.

The most important monosaccharide for the human body is glucose. For energy production, it is broken down via glycolysis, which all body cells are capable of. In the hexose monophosphate pathway, it can be converted into precursors for nucleotide synthesis. Furthermore, it is stored in the form of glycogen, which plays a significant role primarily in the liver, kidneys, and skeletal muscles. During periods of food deprivation, glycogen stores can be broken down to maintain blood sugar levels and thus ensure the energy supply of glucose-dependent tissues. Once they are depleted, glucose must be synthesized by the body. This process, known as gluconeogenesis, mainly occurs in the liver, which is thus the most important organ for glucose homeostasis.

Other important monosaccharides are galactose as a component of milk sugar and fructose as a component of table sugar. They are also mostly metabolized in the liver.
## Chemical Structure of Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates (syn. saccharides) are summarized under the general formula Cn(H2O)n. They are aldehydes or ketones of polyhydric alcohols, thus containing a carbonyl group and at least two hydroxyl groups.

### Monosaccharide

Monosaccharides are the building blocks ("monomers") of carbohydrates.

#### Structure

- Basic framework: Sugar made up of at least three carbon atoms with at least one carbonyl group and at least two hydroxyl groups.
    - Pentose: Sugars with 5 carbon atoms, e.g. ribose and ribulose
    - Hexose: Sugars with 6 carbon atoms, e.g. glucose and fructose
    - Aldose: The carbonyl group of the sugar is an aldehyde.
    - Ketose: The carbonyl group of the sugar is a ketone
- Ring formation: In solution - and also in the human body - monosaccharides are only partially present in chain form; they prefer the ring form.
    - Pyranose: Six-membered Ring
    - Furanose: Five-membered ring
    - Ring formation of aldoses
        - The aldehyde group reacts with a hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal.
        - For glucose: The aldehyde group at the C1 atom reacts with the hydroxyl group at the C5 atom. This leads to the formation of a pyranose.
    - Ring formation of ketoses
        - The ketone group reacts with a hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal.
        - With fructose: The ketone group at the C2 atom reacts with a hydroxyl group at the C5 or C6 atom. This results in the formation of a furanose or a pyranose.
- Ring opening: A spontaneous ring opening in solution is only possible if the anomeric C-atom of a sugar unit is not involved in a glycosidic bond.
- Stereoisomerism
    - Anomer
        - Through ring formation, a center of asymmetry (chirality center) is created at the former carbonyl carbon of the ring. This is referred to as the anomeric center.
        - α-Form: Hydroxyl group is located below the plane of the ring in the Haworth projection.
        - β-Form: Hydroxyl group is located above the plane of the ring in the Haworth projection.
        - Mutarotation: In aqueous solution, the α- and β-forms interconvert through an open-chain form as an intermediate step until equilibrium is reached; as a result, the optical rotation value of this aqueous solution also changes.
    - Enantiomer: Enantiomers occur when all OH groups on asymmetric C atoms have the opposite configuration! In glucose, for example, there are four C atoms.
        - D-Form: The hydroxyl group on the asymmetric carbon atom that is furthest away from the aldehyde or ketone group points to the right (in the Fischer projection)
        - L-Form: The hydroxyl group on the asymmetric carbon atom that is furthest away from the aldehyde or ketone group points to the left (in the Fischer projection)
        - Example: D-Glucose and L-Glucose
    - Diastereomer
        - Example: L-Glucose and D-Galactose
    - Epimer
        - Example: D-Glucose and D-Galactose

> [!NOTE]
> One can recognize glucose in the Fischer projection by the specific arrangement of its OH groups "right-left-right-right" or also TA-TÜ-TA-TA (read from top to bottom)!

#### Classification

- By number of C atoms
- According to the position of the carbonyl group in aldoses and ketoses
- Combined: For example, aldohexose
- By ring size

#### Representation

- Fischer projection: Open chain form
- Haworth projection: Ring form
- Lewis projection: Ring shape with additional angles, appears in "chair form" and "boat form"

> [!NOTE]
> F-L-O-H: The substituents that are on the left in the Fischer projection are at the top in the Haworth projection!

#### Reactions

Monosaccharides are highly reactive. The following table provides an overview of possible reactions and their products using glucose as an example:

|Reaction|Product|
|---|---|
|- Oxidation of the hydroxyl group at C1|- Gluconolactone|
|- Oxidation of the terminal CH2OH group|- Glucuronic acid|
|- Reduction of the C1 constant carbonyl group|- Sorbitol (sugar alcohol)|
|- Exchange of a hydroxyl group for an amino group<br>    - Acetylation of the amino group|- Glucosamine (amino sugar)<br>    <br>    - N-Acetyl-Glucosamine|

> [!NOTE]
> Glucuronic acid plays an important role in biotransformation. It is primarily attached to steroids, bilirubin, and phenolic rings, making them water-soluble and excretable!

### The glycosidic bond

Connections made from monosaccharides are formed through so-called glycosidic bonds: this bond arises from the reaction of the hemiacetal hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon atom with another hydroxyl group or an amino group, with the elimination of water. An acetal is formed.

|Systematics of the Nomenclature of Glycosidic Bonds|   |
|---|---|
|Reactants|- O-glycosidic bond: Between two hydroxyl groups<br>- N-glycosidic bond: Between a hydroxyl group and an amino group|
|Position of the hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon atom|- α-glycosidic bond: α-position<br>- β-glycosidic bond: β-position|
|Involved C-atoms|- E.g. 1,4-glycosidic bond: Between the hydroxyl groups on the C1 atom of one and the C4 atom of the second monosaccharide|

#### Disaccharide

- Definition: Two O-glycosidically linked monosaccharides
- Types
    - Reducing disaccharides: The glycosidic bond is formed between the hydroxyl group of an anomeric C-atom and that of a non-anomeric C-atom.
        - Result: The disaccharide can be further oxidized at one free anomeric C-atom.
    - Non-reducing disaccharides: The glycosidic bond is formed between the hydroxyl groups of the two anomeric C atoms.
        - Consequence: The disaccharide no longer has a free anomeric carbon atom and therefore cannot be further oxidized.

| Maltose                                      | - 2×Glucose                  | - α-Glc-(1,4)-Glc: The hydroxyl group on the α-configured, anomeric C1 atom of one glucose molecule forms a bond with the hydroxyl group on the C4 atom of the second glucose molecule (reducing disaccharide) |
| Lactose<br><br>("milk sugar")                | - 1×Glucose<br>- 1×Galactose | - β-Gal-(1,4)-Glc: The hydroxyl group at the β-configured anomeric C1 atom of galactose links with the hydroxyl group at the C4 atom of α- or β-configured glucose (reducing disaccharide)                     |

#### Oligosaccharide

- Definition: Three to ten glycosidically linked monosaccharides
- Occurrence in the organism
    - In plant-based foods
    - Frequently bound to lipids or membrane-bound proteins
    - Play an important role in the surface differentiation of cells

#### Polysaccharide

- Definition: Polymers made up of more than ten O-glycosidically linked monosaccharides
    - One distinguishes between homoglycans and heteroglycans.

##### Important Homoglycans from the Basic Building Block Glucose

|Name|   |Binding Type|Function in the Organism|
|---|---|---|---|
|“Starch” (consists of about 70% amylopectin and about 30% amylose)|   |- Amylopectin: α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic<br>- Amylose: α-1,4-glycosidic|- Most important food carbohydrate|
|Glycogen|   |- α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic|- Storage form of carbohydrates in the human organism|
|Cellulose|   |- β-1,4-glycosidic|- Component of plant cell walls|

> [!NOTE]
> In the human digestive tract, there are no enzymes that can break β-glycosidic bonds of polysaccharides. Cellulose therefore remains undigested in the intestines and is referred to as dietary fiber!

##### Important Heteroglycans

- Glycoproteins
    - Definition: Proteins with attached short carbohydrate chains
        - Commonly occurring carbohydrate: N-Acetylglucosamine (which is attached to asparagine residues of proteins, known as N-glycosylation)
    - Function: Membrane proteins, plasma proteins, mucins
        - Commonly occurring amino acids in mucins: The carbohydrate chains of mucins are usually linked to serine and threonine residues of the protein portion.
- Proteoglycans
    - Definition: Protein with many covalently linked glycosaminoglycan side chains that contain sulfate groups, which are negatively charged under physiological conditions.
    - Function: Important component of the extracellular matrix
- Glycosaminoglycans: Linear polysaccharides made up of repeating disaccharide building blocks. These consist of a uronic acid (often glucuronic acid) and an amino sugar (often N-acetylglucosamine).
    - Heparin (anticoagulant medication)
    - Chondroitin sulfate (occurs, for example, in cartilage)
    - Hyaluronic acid (Important component of the skin and synovial fluid)
- Peptidoglycan
    - Definition: Long carbohydrate chains with a short peptide chain
    - Function: E.g. peptidoglycan as an important component of the bacterial cell wall

## Digestion and Absorption

### Digestion

- Carbohydrates in food
    - Sources: E.g. sugar, grains, fruits, vegetables,
    - Availability
        - About ⅔ in the form of starch (a polysaccharide)
        - About ⅓ as disaccharides (lactose, sucrose)
- Process: In the duodenum, only monosaccharides can be absorbed.
    - Mouth: Initiation of the breakdown of polysaccharides into di- and oligosaccharides by salivary amylase.
    - Duodenum
        - Further digestion by pancreatic amylase
        - Splitting of di- and oligosaccharides into monosaccharides by further enzymes in the duodenum

> [!NOTE]
> Digestive enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates are referred to as glycosidases. All glycosidases are hydrolases!

|Name of the Enzyme|Occurrence|Reaction|Substrate/Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|α-Amylase|- In saliva (α-Amylase 1, Ptyalin)<br>- In pancreatic secretions|- Hydrolytic cleavage of the internal 1,4-glycosidic bonds of polysaccharides|- Substrate: Polysaccharides<br>- Products<br>    - Maltose<br>    - Isomaltose: Isomaltose is one of the breakdown products of starch and features a 1,6-glycosidic bond, which can only be further cleaved by sucrase-isomaltase.<br>    - Maltotriose<br>    - Branched oligosaccharides|
|Lactase|- In the small intestine: Lactase is located as an integral membrane protein on the brush border membrane of the main cells of the villous epithelium.|- Hydrolytic cleavage of lactose|- Substrate: lactose<br>- Products<br>    - Glucose<br>    - Galactose|
|Sucrase-Isomaltase|- In the small intestine: The sucrase-isomaltase is located on the microvilli of the enterocytes|- Hydrolytic cleavage, especially of disaccharides|- Substrates<br>    - Maltose<br>    - Maltotriose<br>    - Isomaltose<br>    - Sucrose<br>- Products<br>    - Glucose<br>    - Fructose|
|Maltase-Glucoamylase|- In the small intestine|- Hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal 1,4-glycosidic bonds|- Substrate<br>    - Polysaccharides<br>    - Oligosaccharides<br>    - Disaccharides<br>- Product<br>    - Glucose|

> [!NOTE]
> Lactase is the only digestive enzyme in the human body that can cleave β-glycosidic bonds – however, only those of the disaccharide lactose. Polysaccharides with β-glycosidic bonds (e.g., cellulose) cannot be digested!

> [!NOTE] Lactose intolerance
> The enzyme lactase is physiologically produced in the human organism during early childhood. Normally, there is a decrease in lactase production after weaning, resulting in lactose being either not digested or only insufficiently digested. It reaches the large intestine undigested, where it is fermented, which can lead to bloating and diarrhea. This is referred to as "lactose intolerance." Approximately 70% of adults worldwide are affected, with an estimated 15% in Germany.

### Resorption

Glucose enters the enterocytes of the duodenum and the tubular cells of the kidney via symport with two Na+-ions through the SGLT (short for sodium-dependent glucose transporter). In all other cells of the body, uptake occurs through another family of specific glucose transporters (known as GLUT).

- Absorption in the intestine
    - SGLT (SGLT1)
        - Specific transporter on the luminal side of the mucosal cells
        - The driving force is a sodium concentration gradient maintained by the basally located Na+/K+-ATPase (principle of secondary active transport).
        - Sodium follows this concentration gradient and takes one glucose molecule into the cell.
- Transport in the blood: Unbound
- Uptake into the target cells
    - GLUT
        - Group of specific glucose transporters found in the membranes of almost all body cells
        - Passive transport via facilitated diffusion
        - Meanwhile, at least five types are known that differ in terms of localization and functionality.
- Resumption in the kidney
    - SGLT (SGLT1 and SGLT2)
        - Free filtration of glucose in the glomeruli of the kidney
        - Complete reabsorption in the proximal tubule

## Overview of Glucose Metabolism

- Breakdown of glucose
    - Glycolysis
    - Hexosemonophosphate pathway
- Synthesis of glucose: Gluconeogenesis
- Storage of glucose: Glycogen metabolism

## Metabolism of Galactose

Galactose is a component of lactose. Lactose is broken down in the small intestine by the enzyme lactase, and the released galactose is transported to the liver for further metabolism.

### Breakdown of Galactose

- Galactose is introduced into glucose metabolism through several intermediate steps: Galactose → Galactose-1-phosphate → UDP-Galactose → UDP-Glucose → Glucose-1-phosphate
- The following enzymes are involved
    - Galactokinase: ATP-dependent phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate
    - Galactose-1-phosphate Uridyl-Transferase: Exchanges the UDP residue of a UDP-Glucose with the phosphate residue of Galactose-1-phosphate.
    - UDP-Galactose-Epimerase: Epimerization of UDP-Galactose to UDP-Glucose

> [!NOTE] Galactosemia
> A deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase, leading to the accumulation of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate in the blood and urine, causes the clinical picture of congenital galactosemia with damage to the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, and lens of the eyes. Therefore, therapy must immediately involve stopping the intake of lactose and galactose.

### Synthesis of Galactose

- Plays a role primarily in the lactating mammary gland.
- Inversion of the above-mentioned reactions of galactose breakdown

## Metabolism of Fructose

Fructose is contained as a component of sucrose in many foods. In the body, it plays an important role primarily as an energy source for sperm cells.

### Breakdown of Fructose

- Location: Liver cells
- Process: Is introduced into glycolysis through an alternative pathway: Fructose → Fructose-1-phosphate → Dihydroxyacetone phosphate + Glyceraldehyde
    - Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is directly incorporated into glycolysis.
    - Glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated by triose kinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is then fed into glycolysis.
- The following enzymes are involved:
    - Fructokinase: ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate
    - Aldolase B: Cleavage of fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde
    - Triosekinase: ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

> [!NOTE] Fructose intolerance
> The hereditary fructose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of Aldolase B. Consequently, there is an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which then inhibits glycogen phosphorylase and thus glycogenolysis. There is less inorganic phosphate (Pi) available for ATP synthesis, among other things. Gluconeogenesis is suppressed by inhibition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The consequences include pronounced hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and vomiting. Symptoms usually become apparent when the infant is switched from breast milk to formula, which often contains sucrose.

### Synthesis of Fructose (Polyol Pathway)

- Fructose serves as a substrate for sperm cells to provide energy; it is synthesized from glucose with the help of two enzymes.
    - Aldose reductase (Cofactor: NADPH+H+): Reduces glucose at the C1 atom to sorbitol
    - Sorbitol dehydrogenase (Cofactor: NAD+): Oxidizes sorbitol at the C2 atom to fructose

## Review Questions on the Chapter Carbohydrates
### Chemical Structure of Carbohydrates

Describe the basic structure of a monosaccharide! What properties can be used to categorize its open-chain form?  
- Monosaccharides are the basic building blocks ("monomers") from which all larger carbohydrates are constructed. They consist of at least three carbon atoms with at least one carbonyl and at least two hydroxyl groups. Depending on the number of their carbon atoms, they are referred to as pentoses (five C atoms), hexoses (six C atoms), etc. Furthermore, in the open-chain form, ketoses and aldoses can be distinguished: If the carbonyl group is located at the terminal carbon atom, the group is called an aldehyde group and the monosaccharide is called an aldose. If the carbonyl group is located within the carbon chain (at a so-called secondary carbon atom), it is called a keto group and the monosaccharide is a ketose.

Name examples of pentoses and hexoses!  
- Pentoses are monosaccharides with five carbon atoms, e.g., ribose and ribulose. Hexoses are monosaccharides with six carbon atoms, e.g., glucose and fructose.

Explain the ring formation of monosaccharides using fructose as an example!  
- In aqueous solution – thus also in the human body – monosaccharides prefer the ring form over the chain form. In fructose, the keto group at the C2 atom reacts with a hydroxyl group at the C5 or C6 atom (forming an intramolecular hemiketal), resulting in either a furanose (five-membered ring) or a pyranose (six-membered ring).

What are anomers and what is meant by mutarotation?  
- Anomers are isomers of ring-shaped carbohydrates. Due to the cyclic structure, there is a chirality center (= anomeric center) at the former carbonyl carbon of the sugar, by which an α- and β-form can be distinguished. The α-form refers to carbohydrates whose hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon lies below the ring plane in the Haworth projection. In the β-form, the hydroxyl group at the anomeric carbon is located above the ring plane. The α- and β-forms continuously interconvert in aqueous solution until equilibrium is reached. During this equilibration, the optical rotation of the solution changes until a constant value is established – this is called mutarotation.

What distinguishes D-Glucose from L-Glucose and how is their relationship to each other referred to?  
- D-Glucose and L-Glucose are so-called enantiomers. The hydroxyl groups of their asymmetric carbon atoms (for glucose these are four carbon atoms) have exactly opposite configurations in the Fischer projection. In the enantiomers of glucose, the hydroxyl group of the asymmetric carbon atom farthest from the aldehyde group always points to the right in the D-form, whereas it points to the left in the L-form.

Describe the arrangement of the OH groups of D-glucose in the Fischer projection!  
- The open-chain form of D-glucose is recognized in the Fischer projection by the specific arrangement of its hydroxyl groups: "right-left-right-right" or also TA-TÜ-TA-TA (read from top to bottom).

How are maltose, lactose, and sucrose each structured? Which one is a non-reducing disaccharide?  
- Maltose consists of two glucose molecules linked by an α-1,4 bond. Lactose is formed by a β-1,4-glycosidic bond between glucose and galactose. In sucrose, a glucose molecule is glycosidically bonded via its α-configured anomeric carbon to the β-configured anomeric carbon of a fructose molecule. Among the three mentioned, sucrose is the only non-reducing disaccharide since there is no free hydroxyl group that could be oxidized.

What forms of polysaccharides can be distinguished? Name examples for each!  
- Polysaccharides are polymers composed of more than ten monosaccharides linked via O-glycosidic bonds. One distinguishes homoglucans, consisting of identical monosaccharide units, and heteroglycans composed of different monosaccharides which are often additionally bound to proteins, peptides, and/or lipids. Examples of homoglucans include starch, glycogen, and cellulose; examples of heteroglycans include glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans.

Through which type of bond are amylose and cellulose each characterized?  
- Amylose is a component of starch and consists of glucose units linked by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Cellulose consists of long, unbranched chains of glucose molecules connected by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.

How are proteoglycans and glycoproteins structured?  
- Proteoglycans are mainly composed of carbohydrates bound to a small protein core. They contain sulfate groups that are negatively charged under physiological conditions. Glycoproteins, in contrast, mainly consist of a protein to which short carbohydrate chains are attached. They often contain N-acetylglucosamine, which is linked to asparagine residues of proteins via N-glycosylation.

Describe the structure of glycosaminoglycans and name three examples!  
- Glycosaminoglycans belong to the heteroglycans and consist of unbranched polysaccharide chains of repeating disaccharide units. Each disaccharide unit contains a uronic acid (often glucuronic acid) and an amino sugar (often N-acetylglucosamine). Examples of glycosaminoglycans include heparin (anticoagulant), chondroitin sulfate (cartilage component), and hyaluronic acid (component of connective tissue and synovial fluid).

### Digestion and Absorption

Where do α-amylases occur and what reaction do they catalyze?  
- α-Amylases belong to the group of glycosidases and occur in saliva and pancreatic secretion. They hydrolytically cleave exclusively the internal 1,4-glycosidic bonds of amylose, a component of starch. This produces the disaccharides maltose (1,4-glycosidic bond), isomaltose (1,6-glycosidic bond), limit dextrins (branched oligosaccharides), and maltotriose (trisaccharide with 1,4-glycosidic bonds).

Where is sucrase-isomaltase located and what reaction does it catalyze?  
- Sucrase-isomaltase is a protein of the apical cell membrane of small intestinal enterocytes. It catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of disaccharides into glucose and fructose. Its substrates include maltose and isomaltose molecules formed by α-amylase activity in saliva and duodenal pancreatic secretion.

What causes lactose intolerance?  
- Lactose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lactase. Lactase is a protein of the brush border membrane of small intestinal villi responsible for the hydrolytic cleavage of the disaccharide lactose (milk sugar) into glucose and galactose. With a deficiency, lactose passes unhydrolyzed into the large intestine, ferments there, and leads to diarrhea and flatulence.

Which transport proteins are responsible for the uptake of glucose into the cells of the CNS and the liver, and how do they differ in their affinity for glucose?  
- Glucose uptake into target cells occurs via GLUT (glucose transporters), a group of specific transport proteins that differ in their localization and function. In the CNS, insulin-independent GLUT1 (in capillary endothelium) and GLUT3 (in nerve cells) are predominantly expressed, featuring high affinity for glucose, thus ensuring supply of nerve cells with their primary energy source across the blood-brain barrier. In the cell membrane of hepatocytes, the insulin-independent transporter GLUT2 is most significant. It has a low affinity for glucose with a KM value of about 42 mM. Consequently, hepatocytes only take up glucose at high blood sugar levels and store it as glycogen.

When does an increased insertion of GLUT4 into the cell membrane of skeletal muscle and adipocytes occur?  
- The number of GLUT4 transport proteins inserted into the cell membrane of skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes is regulated insulin-dependently. When blood sugar levels rise, more insulin is released, which binds to insulin receptors on the cell membrane of skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. This induces fusion of the membrane with intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles and thus insertion of new transporters. Therefore, increased blood glucose availability leads to enhanced glucose uptake and storage. In skeletal muscle cells, GLUT4 insertion can also be stimulated insulin-independently by increased motor activity. This process ensures glucose uptake in active muscles.

Which transport proteins are responsible for transporting fructose from the intestinal lumen into the intestinal cell and from the intestinal cell into the blood?  
- Fructose is typically passively absorbed in the small intestine via GLUT5 and then released into the blood together with other carbohydrates via GLUT2 at the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cell.

### Metabolism of Galactose

How is galactose supplied to glucose metabolism? Name the individual reaction steps and the involved enzymes!  
- Galactose is taken up as a component of lactose, cleaved in the small intestine by the enzyme lactase, and further metabolized in the liver. There, galactose is first converted by galactokinase in an ATP-dependent phosphorylation into galactose-1-phosphate. Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase subsequently transfers the UDP moiety of UDP-glucose to galactose-1-phosphate, producing UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. UDP-galactose is converted by UDP-galactose epimerase into UDP-glucose, which enters glycogen synthesis.

What are the consequences of a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme Galactose-1-phosphate Uridyl Transferase and what is the name of the disease it causes?  
- The enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase transfers the UDP moiety from UDP-glucose to galactose-1-phosphate during galactose metabolism. A deficiency of this enzyme, as seen in congenital galactosemia, causes accumulation of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate in blood and urine. If not detected in the first days of life, the disease quickly leads to severe damage of the liver, kidneys, CNS, and eye lenses.

### Metabolism of Fructose

How is fructose supplied to glucose metabolism? Name the individual reaction steps and the involved enzymes!  
- Fructose degradation takes place in the liver. Fructose is ATP-dependently phosphorylated by fructokinase to fructose-1-phosphate, which is then cleaved by aldolase B into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate can be directly fed into glycolysis, while glyceraldehyde is first ATP-dependently phosphorylated by triose kinase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which then also enters glycolysis.

What causes hereditary fructose intolerance?  
- Hereditary fructose intolerance is caused by a deficiency of aldolase B, which leads to accumulation of its substrate fructose-1-phosphate. Fructose-1-phosphate inhibits glycogen phosphorylase, resulting in reduced glycogen breakdown and pronounced hypoglycemia.

How can fructose be synthesized from glucose and what is this metabolic pathway called?  
- Fructose can be synthesized from glucose in the so-called polyol pathway in two reaction steps: Aldose reductase reduces glucose NADPH-dependently at carbon 1 to sorbitol, and sorbitol dehydrogenase then oxidizes sorbitol at carbon 2 to fructose.
