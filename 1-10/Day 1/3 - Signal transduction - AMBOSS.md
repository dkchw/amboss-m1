# Signal transduction

## Summary

The cells of the body perform numerous functions under different conditions and are interdependent in many ways. Therefore, it is essential that they communicate with each other. One way of cell communication is the transmission of signals using so-called extracellular messengers, which include hormones, for example. When such a signaling substance reaches its target cell, the signal must be transmitted from extracellular to intracellular and trigger the respective reactions there. This process is called "signal transduction."

## Basic Terms

- Stimulus: Trigger for the signal
- Signaling molecule: Chemical messenger; also referred to as "ligand" or "first messenger."
    - Specifically activates "his" receptors
    - Examples: Proteins, steroids, small organic molecules such as, for example, NO
- Receptor
    - "Receptor" proteins for the signal
    - React specifically to "their" signaling molecule
        - Cytoplasmic receptors: e.g. steroid receptors
        - Membrane-bound receptors: E.g. G-protein-coupled receptors
        - Nuclear receptors: E.g. ligand-dependent transcription factors
- Signal cascade: Linking individual signal steps
    - Second Messenger: Small molecules (such as cGMP, cAMP, IP3, Ca2+ ions) that serve in the context of signal transduction for the intracellular transmission of a stimulus received from outside the cell.

## Receptors

To exert its effect, an extracellular messenger must bind to a receptor. Lipophilic messengers can pass through the cell membrane and bind to intracellular receptors. Hydrophilic messengers are unable to do so due to the lipophilic properties of the cell membrane. They usually act through integral membrane receptors that translate the signal of the extracellular messenger into an intracellular signal.

### Intracellular Receptors

- Definition: Ligand-dependent transcription factors that act in the cell nucleus
- Examples of ligands
    - Thyroid hormones (Thyroid hormone receptor, TR)
    - Steroid hormones and vitamin D (steroid hormone receptors)
    - all-trans-retinoic acid or retinoate (retinoic acid receptor, RAR)
- Principle of activation
    1. Lipophilic hormones diffuse through the membrane into the cell.
    2. Hormone and receptor form a complex
    3. Hormone-receptor complex binds in the cell nucleus to regulatory promoter elements, so-called "hormone responsive elements," and acts there as a transcription factor.

### Membrane Receptors

Hydrophilic hormones primarily exert their effects through receptors located in the cell membrane. There are three types of membrane receptors: G-protein-coupled receptors, enzyme-linked receptors, and ligand-gated ion channels.

#### G-Protein-Coupled Receptors

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form the largest family of membrane receptors. The principle of the G-protein-coupled receptor is based on three parts: receptor, G-protein, and effector molecule. Upon activation of the receptor, the G-protein is activated, which in turn activates the effector molecule.

- Examples of ligands
    - Catecholamine
    - Gonadotropic Hormone of the Adenohypophysis (ACTH, LH, FSH, TSH)
    - Glucagon
- Receptor structure
    - Receptor with 7 transmembrane helices
    - Binding sites for ligands are located at the extracellular sites or between the helices.
    - The binding site for the G-protein is located intracellularly.
- Structure of the G-protein
    - Heterotrimeric protein with three subunits
        - α-Subunit
            - Binds GDP in the inactive state, GTP in the active state.
            - Has a GTPase activity: Hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and phosphate, thereby terminating its own activity.
            - Anchored by lipid anchors in the cell membrane
        - β-subunit: Exists in a stable complex with the γ-subunit
        - γ-Subunit: Anchored complex with the β-subunit via a lipid anchor in the cell membrane
- Principle of activation
    1. Binding of an extracellular ligand leads to a conformational change in the receptor.
    2. The receptor activates the intracellularly bound G-protein by exchanging GDP for GTP in the α-subunit.
    3. Three subunits of the G-protein dissociate into a) a complex consisting of the β- and γ-subunits and b) the α-subunit
- Membrane-bound effector molecules
    - Activation: Through the α-subunit of the G-protein
    - Function: Synthesis of second messengers (see below) depending on which G-protein is coupled with the receptor
    - Examples: Adenylate cyclase (with Gs or Gi proteins) or phospholipase C (Gq protein)

> [!NOTE]
> Gs proteins stimulate adenylate cyclase, Gi proteins inhibit it!

> [!NOTE] Whooping cough
> An infection with the bacterium Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough, a disease that progresses in stages, characterized by severe, staccato-like coughing fits followed by prolonged stridorous inhalation and possibly vomiting. The pertussis toxin produced by the bacterium is an important virulence factor. It acts on the surrounding tissue of the host by transferring an ADP-ribosyl residue from NAD to an inhibitory Gi protein, thereby inhibiting its activity. This leads to excessive activation of the now disinhibited adenylate cyclase and consequently causes an intracellular increase in cAMP, which damages the host cell. This way, the pathogen may potentially evade phagocytosis by immune cells.

#### Receptor Tyrosine Kinases

- Examples of ligands: Insulin, growth factors (e.g. EGF, IGF)
- Receptor structure:
    1. Ligand-binding Extracellular Region
    2. Individual transmembrane domain
    3. Cytoplasmic part with tyrosine kinase activity
- Principle of activation
    1. Binding of the extracellular ligand leads to the dimerization of two receptors.
    2. Two tyrosine kinase domains are now adjacent and phosphorylate each other at tyrosyl residues (so-called "autophosphorylation").
    3. Increase in kinase activity through autophosphorylation
    4. A variety of different signal transduction molecules with SH2 domains bind to phosphorylated tyrosyl residues and are thereby activated → Activation of various effector molecules from different signaling pathways
- Examples of effector molecules
    - Phospholipase C
    - RAS Protein
        - G-Protein Monomers
        - Connected to the cell membrane via a lipid anchor (farnesyl group)
        - Activation of the RAS protein: The SH2 adapter protein GRB2 is present in the cytosol in a complex with the GTP exchange factor SOS → Upon ligand binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase, the GRB2-SOS complex is recruited and bound to the receptor tyrosine kinase via the GRB2 part → SOS stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP on the RAS protein → Active RAS protein
        - Activated RAS protein activates additional signaling pathways such as the RAF-MEK-MAPK cascade.
            - Serine/Threonine protein kinase RAF is recruited to the cell membrane by RAS and activated by binding to RAS → Active RAF phosphorylates the protein kinase MEK (MAP2K) → MEK phosphorylates and activates MAPK → Transcription of target genes for cell growth, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation
        - RAS has GTPase activity and thus inactivates itself
        - The RAS gene belongs to the proto-oncogenes.
            - Mutations in the RAS gene can lead to a lack of deactivation of the RAS protein due to loss of GTPase activity and the development of tumors.
        - Examples of signal pathways involving RAS participation
            - Insulin
            - PDGF (Factor de Crecimiento Derivado de Plaquetas)
            - Growth factors (e.g., EGF)

#### Receptors with associated tyrosine kinases

- Examples of ligands: growth hormone, prolactin, erythropoietin, interferons, etc.
- Receptor structure
    - Membrane receptor without its own tyrosine kinase activity
    - Tyrosine kinase from the Janus kinase family (abbreviated as "JAK") is coupled to the receptor as a separate protein.
- Principle of activation (JAK-STAT signaling pathway, similar to receptor tyrosine kinases)
    1. Binding of ligands leads to the dimerization of two receptors
    2. Two adjacent tyrosine kinase domains of the JAK kinases phosphorylate each other (“autophosphorylation”) → activation of the JAK kinases
    3. Binding sites for SH2 domains of signaling proteins (so-called STAT proteins) arise at phosphorylated tyrosine residues.
    4. STAT proteins are phosphorylated and dimerized by Janus kinases.
    5. STAT dimers act directly in the cell nucleus as transcription factors for JAK-STAT regulated genes.

> [!NOTE]
> There are receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated, among other things, by insulin, and receptors with associated tyrosine kinases that are activated, for example, by prolactin!

#### Receptor Serine/Threonine Kinases

- Examples of ligands: TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor β)
- Receptor structure: Two subunits (named: Type-I and Type-II receptor) each with serine/threonine kinase activity.
- Principle of activation
    1. Ligand binding
    2. Oligomerization of the receptor
    3. Type II receptor activates Type I receptor
    4. Type I receptor phosphorylates so-called Smad proteins
    5. Smad proteins act as transcription factors for target genes

### Ligand-regulated Ion Channels

In addition to membrane receptors, ligand-regulated channels play an important role in signal transduction. However, since the ligands are largely neurotransmitters, only a brief overview will be provided here.

- Examples of ligands: Acetylcholine, GABA, Glutamate, IP3, Glycine
- Receptor structure: Membrane receptors that function as ion channels belong to the group of channel proteins.
- Principle of Activation (Example)
    1. Binding of a ligand → Conformational change
    2. The opening of a pore allows the influx of ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−)
    3. Change of the membrane potential → Very fast signal response
## Intracellular Signal Transduction

In signal transduction, extracellular signals are converted into intracellular signals. This occurs via so-called second messengers. After receptor activation, their concentration increases in the cytoplasm and regulates, for example, enzymes of cellular metabolism. The second messengers cAMP and IP3/DAG are particularly relevant. At various steps of the signaling pathway, the signal can be amplified multiple times in terms of signal amplification.

### cAMP (Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate) and Protein Kinase A

- cAMP synthesis
    - Membrane-bound adenylate cyclase: Synthesizes cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) from ATP.
    - Signal amplification: Increase in the number of signaling molecules at each step of the signaling cascade
        - Example: An activated adenylate cyclase enzyme synthesizes thousands of cAMP molecules.
    - Regulation of adenylate cyclase: Depending on the type of G-protein of the G-protein-coupled receptor
        - Gs-protein: Stimulation of adenylate cyclase → cAMP ↑
        - G proteins: Inhibition of adenylate cyclase → cAMP ↓
- cAMP effect: Activation of protein kinase A (PKA)
    - Many hormones exert their effects through the cAMP protein kinase A pathway (e.g., ACTH, TSH, Glucagon)
    - Protein kinase A
        - Enzyme class: Serine/Threonine kinase
        - Activation: An increase in cAMP concentration releases the catalytic subunits.
        - Mechanism of action: PKA regulates the activity of numerous enzymes through phosphorylation.
            - Interconversion: "Turning on and off" an enzyme: Through the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, target enzymes can either be activated (e.g., glycogen phosphorylase or hormone-sensitive lipase) or inactivated (e.g., glycogen synthase), with ATP being converted to ADP.
            - Example glycogen metabolism
                1. In case of hypoglycemia: Activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor by glucagon or adrenaline
                2. Increase in cAMP concentration
                3. Activation of protein kinase A
                4. Phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase → Activation → Increased mobilization of glucose from glycogen
                5. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase → Inhibition → Reduced formation of glycogen
                6. Ins.: Increase in blood sugar concentration
- cAMP breakdown: By a phosphodiesterase to AMP (adenosine monophosphate)
### cGMP

In the formation of cGMP, the pathways of soluble and membrane-bound guanylate cyclase must be distinguished:

- NO (Nitric oxide) and soluble guanylate cyclase
    - NO-Synthesis
        - Catalyzed by the so-called endothelial NO synthase (= eNOS) in the endothelial cells of blood vessels
        - Conversion of L-Arginine to L-Citrulline in two NADPH-dependent reactions → NO release
    - Stimulation of eNOS
        - Physical influences such as the wall shear stress of arteries
        - Increase in intracellular calcium concentration in endothelial cells
    - NO-Structure
        - Transient gas: Half-life 2–30 seconds
        - Can freely diffuse through the membrane, meaning it acts as both an intracellular and extracellular signaling molecule.
    - NO effect: Activation of soluble (cytosolic) guanylate cyclase
- Membrane-bound guanylate cyclase
    - Activation: Through binding of extracellular ligands, e.g., ANP
- Effect of both guanylate cyclases: Synthesis of cGMP from GTP
- Examples of cGMP effects
    - Activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G in smooth muscle cells → Inhibition of Ca2+ efflux from the sarcoplasmic reticulum → Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ↓ → Relaxation of smooth vascular muscle → Vasodilation
    - Activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G in platelets → Phosphorylation of various substrates that inhibit platelet aggregation
    - cGMP-dependent ion channels in photoreceptor cells of the retina → Maintenance of the unstimulated state → Dark signal
- cGMP degradation: Through a phosphodiesterase to GMP (guanosine monophosphate)

NO stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase!

> [!NOTE] NO (Nitric oxide)
> NO is an endogenous neurotransmitter that has only a low stability (a few seconds) and is therefore not stored by the body, but synthesized as a result of stimulation. NO primarily acts as a vasodilator in the heart and skeletal muscle and thus plays an important role in the local blood flow response. This effect is utilized in the acute symptomatic treatment of angina pectoris: The so-called nitrates are a group of medicinal substances that stimulate the formation and release of NO. By relaxing the smooth muscle in the vessel walls, an expansion of the coronary arteries is achieved. Systemically, peripheral vasodilation results in a reduction of cardiac preload.

> [!NOTE] Phosphodiesterase inhibitor
> The second messengers cAMP and cGMP are broken down and inactivated by various phosphodiesterases (PDE) into AMP and GMP. In smooth muscle, a decrease in cAMP or cGMP concentration is associated with contraction, which leads, for example, to bronchoconstriction in the lungs. The medicinal use of PDE inhibitors can prevent the breakdown of the second messengers: By inhibiting the lung-specific PDE-IV, the concentration of cAMP increases, resulting in relaxation of the bronchial muscles. Another well-known PDE inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra®), which increases the cGMP level in the vessels of the penis and erectile tissue by inhibiting PDE-V, thereby reducing vascular resistance and enhancing erection. Particularly at high doses, sildenafil additionally inhibits the phosphodiesterase in the retina, which can lead to visual disturbances.

### IP3 and DAG

- Process of synthesis

    1. Activation of a Gq protein-coupled receptor
    2. Activation of phospholipase C
    3. Cleavage of the membrane-bound phospholipid PIP2 (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) into the second messengers IP3 (Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (Diacylglycerol)

    - IP3 (hydrophilic) diffuses into the cytosol → Activation of an IP3 receptor on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum → Release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum through IP3 receptor-coupled calcium channel → Intracellular Ca2+ concentration↑
    - DAG (lipophilic) remains in the membrane → Activation of protein kinase C (PKC)
        - PKC works in a Ca2+-dependent manner (dependent on IP3-mediated Ca2+ release!)
        - Mechanism of action: Regulates the activity of various enzymes through the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, e.g., regulatory proteins influencing cell growth (actin cytoskeleton) or differentiation (EGF receptor)
        - Example of the effect of PKC: cell growth and proliferation

> [!NOTE]
> Gq proteins activate phospholipase C, which cleaves PIP2 into the second messengers IP3 and DAG. These, in turn, activate protein kinase C!

### Ca2+ as a Second Messenger

- Principle
    - Intracellular Ca2+ concentration is normally very low.
    - Second messengers (such as IP3) or depolarization through action potentials lead to the opening of Ca2+ channels in the membrane of the cell or ER → Ca2+ spikes (= strong peaks of concentration)
    - Effect of Ca2+ particularly in complex with Calmodulin: One molecule of Calmodulin binds four Ca2+ ions → Conformational change → Regulation of Calmodulin-dependent kinases/phosphatases, e.g. CaM kinase III (protein biosynthesis)
- Examples of Ca2+-mediated effects
    - Glycogen synthesis↓
    - Cholesterol biosynthesis↓

> [!NOTE]
> Ca2+ mediates the effects of other second messengers, such as IP3 and DAG via protein kinase C. It also acts as a second messenger itself, meaning it has a direct effect, i.e., without the activation of another signaling molecule!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Signal Transduction
### Receptors
With which receptor type does all-trans-retinoic acid (vitamin A acid) interact? Describe its general mechanism of action!
*   All-trans retinoic acid is a ligand of nuclear retinoic acid receptors. These are intracellular receptors (ligand-dependent transcription factors, nuclear receptors) that are activated by their lipophilic ligands after diffusion into the cytosol. The resulting hormone-receptor complex is transported into the nucleus, binds there to regulatory promoter elements of DNA, so-called "Hormone Responsive Elements," and acts as a transcription factor.
    
What functions do the three subunits of the G-protein have respectively?
*   G-proteins are heterotrimeric proteins with one α-, β-, and γ-subunit each. The α-subunit binds GTP when the receptor is activated by a ligand. It also has intrinsic GTPase activity, allowing it to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and phosphate to inactivate itself again. The β- and γ-subunits exist together in a complex and anchor the receptor in the cell membrane using lipids.
    
What type of receptor do catecholamines (dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline) bind to? Name other typical ligands of this receptor type!
*   Catecholamine receptors are so-called G-protein-coupled receptors. Other typical ligands are glucagon and glandotropic hormones of the adenohypophysis (ACTH, LH, FSH, TSH).
    
What are receptor tyrosine kinases and how do they function?
*   Receptor tyrosine kinases are membrane receptors with an extracellular ligand-binding site and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Some tyrosine kinases already exist as dimers in the inactive state; in others, ligand binding leads to dimerization of two receptors. Their tyrosine kinase domains then phosphorylate each other on tyrosyl residues (so-called "autophosphorylation"), thereby increasing the kinase activity of the receptor. A variety of different signal transduction molecules bind to the phosphorylated tyrosyl residues and trigger a signaling cascade through effector molecules.
    
What are classical ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases?
*   Classical ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases are insulin and various growth factors (e.g., EGF, IGF, PDGF).
    
Describe the function of the RAS protein! What happens when there is a mutation in the RAS gene?
*   The RAS protein is a so-called proto-oncogene: It is both a receptor tyrosine kinase effector and a monomeric G-protein whose task is stimulating cell proliferation. Through mutation, RAS can lose its GTPase activity, which means that once activated, it remains permanently active. This leads to uncontrolled cell division and thus to tumor development.
    
What signaling cascade is initiated alongside the protein kinase B (PKB) signaling pathway by the activation of the RAS protein via the insulin receptor?
*   Insulin binding to the insulin receptor activates, among other things, the RAS protein. This can then initiate the so-called MAP kinase cascade, which activates transcription factors by phosphorylation and thus stimulates cell growth and proliferation.
    
### Intracellular Signal Transduction
What is cAMP, how is it synthesized and broken down?
*   cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger synthesized from ATP by membrane-bound adenylate cyclase that activates an intracellular signaling cascade. To terminate the signal, cAMP is hydrolyzed to AMP by a specific phosphodiesterase.
    
How is nitric oxide synthesized and what stimulates the synthesis?
*   Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from L-arginine by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in the endothelial cells of blood vessels. eNOS is activated by physical influences such as increased wall shear stress in arteries.
    
What is special about the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) and how does it act in smooth vascular muscle cells?
*   Nitric oxide (NO) is a very small molecule that can freely diffuse through tissue. It is also a short-lived radical that does not need to be actively degraded or inactivated. In smooth vascular muscle cells, it activates soluble guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP into cGMP. Through activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G, Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is inhibited, leading to relaxation of the smooth vascular muscle and consequently to vasodilation.
    
What effect does the binding of ANP (Atrial Natriuretic Peptide) to its receptor (Natriuretic Peptide Receptor A (NPR-A)) on the vascular endothelium have?
*   The receptor for natriuretic peptides is a membrane-bound guanylate cyclase. When ANP binds, GTP is converted to cGMP, which in turn, as an intracellular second messenger, activates a cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Through this mechanism, ANP mediates vasodilation.
    
Describe the effect of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the smooth muscle of blood vessels and bronchi!
*   The second messengers cAMP and cGMP are broken down and inactivated by various phosphodiesterases to AMP and GMP. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are a group of drugs that inhibit the activity of these phosphodiesterases, thereby increasing the concentration of cAMP and cGMP. This causes vasodilation and bronchodilation through relaxation of smooth muscle, reducing airway resistance.
    
What are IP3 and DAG and how are they formed?
*   Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) are second messengers of a G-protein-coupled signaling cascade. The receptor-activated Gq proteins activate phospholipase C, which cleaves the membrane-bound phospholipid PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) into IP3 and DAG.
    
What are the functions of IP3 and DAG?
*   After its formation, IP3 diffuses into the cytosol and binds there to specific IP3 receptors of the endoplasmic reticulum. This causes release of Ca2+ and an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which in turn influences various intracellular processes. Because DAG is lipophilic, it remains anchored in the cell membrane and activates protein kinase C there. Protein kinase C opens calcium channels in the cell membrane, further increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Additionally, it regulates the activity of various enzymes through phosphorylation, thereby influencing, among other things, cell growth and proliferation.
