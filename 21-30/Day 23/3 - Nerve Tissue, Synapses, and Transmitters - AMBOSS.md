# Nerve Tissue, Synapses, and Transmitters
## Summary

In the body, two fundamentally different nervous systems are distinguished: the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which includes all nerves outside of the CNS. Nerves are the "power lines" of the human body. They control movements and organ functions among other things, and serve as transmitters of sensory inputs. Depending on their system affiliation (peripheral or central nervous system or somatic or autonomic nervous system) and function, they can have very different structures; however, their neurons all have the same structure consisting of a cell body and cell extensions (axons and dendrites). Neurons receive information and transmit it to other nerves or their target organ. This information is transmitted along the nerve fiber either continuously and therefore slower, or saltatorily (in jumps). If the information is to be transmitted to another nerve fiber or an organ, this occurs with the help of electrical or chemical synapses, which use transmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, etc.). Information from the autonomic nervous system is switched in ganglia during its transmission process. Nerve fibers are also distinguished based on their function or the direction of their information transmission into afferents and efferents: Afferents transmit information from the periphery of the body to the CNS, while efferents transmit information from the CNS to the periphery.
## Classification of the Nervous System

- Topographic classification
    - Central Nervous System (CNS): Brain and Spinal Cord
    - Peripheral Nervous System (PNS): All nerves outside of the CNS
- Functional Classification
    - Somatic Nervous System: Processing of stimuli that affect the body from within and outside
    - Autonomic Nervous System (ANS): Regulation of organ function
## Nerve Tissue

The cells of the nervous system can be divided into two groups: neurons (nerve cells) and glial cells (support cells).

### Neuron (Nerve Cells)

Neurons are found in the peripheral and central nervous system and primarily function as elements for receiving, transmitting, and processing stimuli. Each neuron consists of a cell body and its associated extensions (dendrites and axons) and is functionally oriented in structure (signal reception/receptor → signal conduction → signal transmission). The extensions are also referred to as “neurites” and form the neuropil (“nerve hair”). It establishes the connection to synapses through which neurons are interconnected.

#### Cell body

- Core
    - Structure: Uncoiled DNA
    - Staining behavior: In Nissl staining, overall pale staining (as there is little heterochromatin); nucleolus highly stainable
- Perikaryon (Soma)
    - Supply center of the neuron → High metabolic activity → Large number of organelles
        - Nissl bodies: Rough endoplasmic reticulum, which becomes visible as a granular substance after staining with basic substances.
- Axon hillock (initial segment, Colliculus axonis)
    - Function: Starting point of the axon, conversion of depolarizations into action potentials
        - Convergence of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials → Triggering of a depolarization
        - High density of sodium channels in the subplasmalemmal dense zone of the so-called initial segments → excitation threshold low → depolarizations more easily converted into action potentials (APs) → propagation of the APs via axon
    - Morphology: Free of Nissl bodies
- Cytoskeleton
    - Neurofilaments: Intermediate filaments of nerve cells; they aggregate to form neurofibrils.
    - Neurotubules: Microtubules of nerve cells; anterograde and retrograde axonal transport of substances
        - Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs): stiffen neurotubules, intertwining them with other cytoskeleton elements.
    - Actin filaments: Lie beneath the cell membrane, form a support structure, insert into important support proteins of the membrane

#### Cell fortifications

- Dendrites
    - Definition: Tree-like branching extensions that direct signals towards the soma
    - Structure
        - Several tree-like branching dendrites converge into a neuron (surface enlargement)
        - At their ends, there are so-called "spines" (= thorns) that serve as docking sites for synapses
- Axon
    - Definition: Nerve cell process that serves to transmit neuronal signals
    - Structure
        - Division into 3 segments
            1. Initial segment: A short section immediately following the axon hillock that is unmyelinated and contains many Na+ channels.
            2. Middle part with axon segments
            3. End segment with presynaptic termination (also: axon terminals, "boutons")
        - Axolemma: Cell membrane of the axon
        - Axoplasm: Cytoplasm of the axon, which contains neurofilaments and neurotubules
        - Glial sheath: Sheath of the axon
    - Staining behavior: Golgi silvering best illustrates axon initial segments, dendrites, and perikarya of individual neurons.
    - Function
        - Transmission of neural signals (in the form of action potentials) from the cell body to a target cell
        - Axonal Transport
            - Anterograde: Components of synapses, organelles, and precursors of secretory vesicles are transported from the center (perikaryon) to the periphery (axon terminal).
                - The rapid anterograde transport along the neurotubules occurs with the help of the motor protein kinesin
            - Retrograde: Vesicles with degradable proteins and cell organelles are transported by the motor protein dynein along the neurotubules from the periphery back to the perikaryon

> [!NOTE]
> Every neuron has only one axon!

> [!NOTE]
> Since there is no rough ER and no Golgi apparatus in the axon hillock – in contrast to the initial segment of the dendrites – the base of the axon is narrower and finer than that of a dendrite!

#### Classification of Neurons

Nerve cells can be classified depending on their shape (see: Neuron classification by number of cell processes) and function (see: Neuron classification by function).

##### Neuron Classification by Number of Cell Processes

- Unipolar Neuron: One axon, no dendrites (possibly dendritic processes branching off from the axon)
    - Very rare in vertebrates
    - Occurrence: Embryogenesis
- Pseudounipolar Neuron: Only one process
    - Shortly after departure from perikaryon: Division of the extension into an axonal and a dendritic branch
    - Occurrence: Sensory ganglia of the spinal and cranial nerves
- Bipolar Neurons: A axon, a dendrite
    - Occurrences: Retina, olfactory epithelium, cranial nerve ganglia of the inner ear
- Multipolar Neuron: >2 extensions (one axon, several dendrites)
    - Most common neuron type
    - Occurrence: Anterior horn of the spinal cord, pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex

##### Neuron Classification by Function

- Sensory neurons: Conduct afferent information to the CNS
- Motor neuron: Conduct efferent information from the CNS to motor target organs.
- Projection neurons (so-called Golgi-I cells): Multipolar neurons with long axon, transmit information over medium to long distances from one area of the CNS to another.
- Interneuron: Multipolar neurons with short axon that connect several neurons over short distances in the CNS, meaning they do not have any sensory or motor function themselves.
    - Function: Modulate and regulate the spread and strength of excitation
    - Example: Spinal interneurons, retinal interneurons
- Neuroendocrine Cells: Hormone Synthesis and Secretion

### Glial Cells (Support Cells)

There are about as many glial cells as nerve cells. They form the framework for nerve cells and are involved in their metabolism. The glial cells of the PNS differ from those of the CNS.

|Occurrence|Glial cell|Important properties|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|Peripheral Nervous System|Schwann Cells|- Regenerative|- Form myelin sheaths of the PNS|
|Mantle cells (= satellite cells, amphicytes)|- Flat cells that envelop perikarya in spinal ganglia<br>- Characterized by small, dark nuclei|- Are involved in the metabolism of neurons|
|Central Nervous System|Astrocytes|- The most common glial cells of the CNS<br>- Form glial end-feet in contact with capillaries<br>- Astrocytes connected to each other and to oligodendrocytes via gap junctions (→ Functional syncytium)<br>- Produce particularly high amounts of GFAP|- Support function, scar formation after tissue damage<br>- Involved in the formation of the blood-brain barrier<br>- Uptake of metabolic products, nourishment, and regeneration of neurons<br>- Do not generate action potentials, as they have very few voltage-gated sodium channels and a significantly more negative resting membrane potential (about -90 mV) than neurons<br>- Maintenance of the neuronal environment, among other things, by taking up extracellular K+ during high neuronal activity<br>- Release chemical transmitters for synaptic information processing (so-called gliotransmission)|
|Oligodendrocytes|- Few, short extensions<br>- Not capable of regeneration|- Form myelin sheaths of the CNS|
|Microglia (Hortega cells)|- Mobile through extensions|- Phagocytosis (Macrophages of the CNS)|
|Ependymal cells|- Resemble iso- to columnar epithelial cells<br>- Are connected to one another via gap junctions|- Lining of the internal cerebrospinal fluid spaces (brain ventricles and central canal)|
|Radial glia|- Primarily found in the immature, developing brain<br>- Exception: In the form of Müller cells (retina) and Bergmann glia (cerebellum), they also occur in the adult brain|- Serve as a guiding structure for the radial migration of neuroblasts during the development of nervous tissue<br>- Various additional functions, some of which are still not clarified|

 > [!NOTE] Neurinoma
> Neurinomas are benign tumors originating from Schwann cells and are sometimes referred to as Schwannomas. They can occur throughout the entire peripheral nervous system, but often arise from the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve (vestibular schwannoma or also called acoustic neuroma). Early clinical symptoms include hearing disturbances, dizziness, and gait instability. Over time, it can also lead to compression of other nerves (e.g., facial nerve → peripheral facial palsy). The treatment usually consists of the surgical removal of the tumor.

> [!NOTE] Glioma
> Degenerate glial cells are the origin of almost all brain tumors. Depending on which subtype they originate from, we differentiate between astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and glioblastomas. The latter are highly malignant and have the worst prognosis among gliomas.

### Nerve Fibers

- Nerve fibers: Consist of an axon and the associated glial sheath.
- Glial sheath: Consists of glial cells and surrounds the axons of nerve cells
    - In ZNS from oligodendrocytes
    - In the PNS from Schwann cells
- Myelin sheath
    - Several layers of glial sheath (glial cell plasma membranes) envelop the axon in a lamellar fashion and form the myelin sheath
    - Ranvier nodes: Constrictions where the myelin sheath is interrupted and one axon segment transitions into the next.
    - Internode: Section between two Ranvier nodes
    - Composition
        - 70% Lipids (Phospholipids, Glycolipids, Cholesterol)
        - 30% Protein

> [!NOTE] Multiple Sclerosis
> Multiple Sclerosis is a neurological disorder of the CNS and is associated with demyelinations in the brain and spinal cord. These affect the innervation of organs and muscles, leading to progressive or relapsing impairments of several systems, such as the motor system (disrupted oculomotor function), the cerebellum (ataxia), the autonomic nervous system (bladder and bowel dysfunction), the sensory system (localized sensory disturbances), and cognition (deficits in memory and concentration performance).

> [!NOTE] Optic neuritis (Neuritis of the optic nerve, Retrobulbar neuritis)
> Optic neuritis is often the first symptom of multiple sclerosis and is associated with unilateral color vision disturbance and visual impairment as well as orbital pain. Notably, the eye examination is usually unremarkable. The underlying cause of optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which results in action potentials being slowed down or not transmitted at all.

### Connective tissue sheaths of a nerve

A peripheral nerve fiber consists of axons, glial cells, and a surrounding connective tissue sheath. Several nerve fibers are bundled together to form nerves.

|Connective tissue sheath  <br>(from outside to inside)|Structure|Content|
|---|---|---|
|Epineurium|- Continuation of the Dura mater<br>- Composed of collagen fibers<br>- Contains the blood vessels of the nerve|- Bundles the nerve fibers into a single nerve|
|Perineurium|- Several layers of epithelioid cells|- Bundles several nerve fibers into a nerve fiber bundle|
|Endoneurium|- Delicate collagen and reticular fibers<br>- Contains fine blood and lymph capillaries|- Encloses each individual nerve fiber|

#### Classification of Nerve Fibers

Nerve fibers can be classified based on the thickness of their myelin sheath and their conduction velocity.

|Fiber Class (according to Lloyd and Hunt)|Fiber Class (according to Erlanger and Gasser)|Myelin Sheath|Diameter|Conduction Velocity|Occurrence|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|I|Aα-fibers|Yes|approx. 15 μm|approx. 60–120 m/s|- Afferents: Muscle spindles<br>- Efferents: α-motoneurons|
|II|Aβ fibers|Yes|approx. 8 μm|approx. 30–60 m/s|- Afferents: Mechanoreceptors of the skin|
||Aγ-fibers|Yes|approx. 5 μm|approx. 2–30 m/s|- Efferents: Muscle spindles|
|III|Aδ fibers|Yes|approx. 3 μm|- Afferents: Thermo- and nociceptors of the skin (earlier, sharper pain)|
||B-fibers|Yes|<3 μm|approx. 3–15 m/s|- Efferents: Sympathetic, preganglionic nerve fibers|
|IV|C-fibers|No|approx. 1 μm|approx. 0.25–1.5 m/s|- Afferents: Thermo- and nociception (later, duller pain)<br>- Efferents: Sympathetic, postganglionic fibers|

> [!NOTE]
> The larger the diameter of the nerve fiber, the higher the conduction velocity!

### Ganglien

Ganglia are collections of perikarya (nerve cell bodies) that appear as thickened areas along a nerve strand. In ganglia of the autonomic nervous system, preganglionic nerve fibers are connected to postganglionic nerve fibers. In contrast, spinal ganglia only represent a collection of nerve cell bodies that transmit information unchanged.

|Ganglion type|Connection|Occurrence|System affiliation|Cells|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Spinal ganglia|No|- Dorsal root of a spinal nerve|Somatic nervous system|- Pseudounipolar neurons with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli<br>- Satellite cells|
|Vegetative Ganglia|Yes|- Paravertebral ganglia: Parallel to the spine (paravertebral ganglia)<br>- Prevertebral ganglia: Located near the large abdominal vessels<br>- Intramural ganglia: In organs|Autonomic Nervous System|- Multipolar Neurons<br>- Satellite Cells|

#### Signal transmission in ganglia

- Divergence: A preganglionic neuron branches into many postganglionic neurons (distributing function)
- Convergence: Many preganglionic neurons converge to a postganglionic neuron (high safety level of the synaptic transmission)
- A signal transmission probably occurs only between functionally similar neurons

### Plexus

Plexuses (lat. Geflecht) are junction points for nerve fibers, which originate from different ganglia or spinal cord segments. They are found in both the somatic and autonomic nervous systems and are often located near the organs they supply.

- Plexus of the somatic nervous system
    - Cervical plexus
    - Brachial plexus
    - Plexus lumbosacralis
- Plexus of the autonomic nervous system
    - Celiac plexus
    - Superior mesenteric plexus
    - Inferior mesenteric plexus
    - Other organ plexuses (e.g. cardiac plexus, pulmonary plexus, gastric plexus)
## Synapses

Synapses are junctions between two neurons or between a neuron and a target organ. On the surface of each neuron are several synapses that are simultaneously active and can either excite or inhibit the neuron. A distinction is made between electrical and chemical synapses.

### Electrical Synapse

Electrical synapses are far less common than chemical ones and transmit excitation between two cells via an ionic current. The transmission of excitation can occur in both directions ("bidirectional") and without time delay. Electrical synapses can be found between neural cells, for example, in the retina.

#### Structure

- Membranes of pre- and postsynaptic cell
- Gap Junctions (Nexus): Cell-cell channels between pre- and postsynapse, formed from connexin protein complexes (so-called connexons)

#### Functionality

1. A presynaptic cell is depolarized by an action potential
2. Since the other connected cell is not yet excited, a potential difference occurs.
3. Ion current through connexons
4. Depolarization of the other postsynaptic cell = electrical coupling
5. Triggering of an action potential at the postsynaptic cell if the threshold potential is exceeded.

### Chemical Synapse

Chemische Synapsen sind die häufigste Synapsenform im menschlichen Körper. Sie geben die Informationen eines Neurons mithilfe eines Botenstoffes (sog. Transmitter) an ein anderes Neuron oder ein Zielorgan weiter. Im Gegensatz zu elektrischen Synapsen ist der Informationsfluss bei chemischen Synapsen nur in eine Richtung möglich („unidirektional“, Präsynapse → Postsynapse), da die Postsynapse keine Transmitter ausschütten kann. Die Signalweiterleitung an einer chemischen Synapse dauert weniger als 0,5 Millisekunden.

#### Aufbau

- Presynapse: Contains mitochondria (energy supply of the presynapse) and vesicles (transmitter storage)
- Synaptic cleft: In this, the presynapse releases the transmitters that diffuse across the cleft.
- Postsynapse: Transmitter-Effect

#### Functionality

1. Presynapse: Conversion of electrical signal (Action potential) → Chemical signal (Transmitter release)
    - Transmitter are synthesized in the perikaryon of the neuron and transported anterogradely along the axon to the presynaptic terminal.
    - Near the presynaptic membrane, the transmitter is stored in vesicles
    - The electrical signal in the form of a depolarization causes voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+) channels to open at the presynaptic ending, resulting in an influx of Ca2+.
2. Synaptic Cleft: Neurotransmitter release from Presynapse
    - Ca2+-mediated, the vesicle fuses with the presynaptic membrane and releases the transmitter through exocytosis.
        - Synaptotagmin functions as a Ca2+ sensor and detects the increase in calcium concentration at the presynaptic terminal, after which SNARE proteins are activated.
        - SNARE proteins mediate vesicle fusion (= transmitter release) at the presynapse by interacting the SNARE proteins of the vesicles (v-SNARES, e.g., synaptobrevin) with the SNARE-proteins of the target cell membrane (from English target, t-SNARES)
    - Synaptic facilitation
        - The larger the Ca2+ influx, the more neurotransmitter molecules are released from the vesicles and the stronger the signal at the postsynaptic membrane.
        - If another action potential reaches the presynapse while calcium is still flowing in, the "old" and "new" amounts of calcium add up, resulting in increased transmitter release.
    - Increased extracellular magnesium (Mg2+) concentrations can inhibit this process, as magnesium uses the same ion channel as Ca2+. This results in a reduced Ca2+ influx and consequently a decreased neurotransmitter release.
3. Postsynapse: Transmitter binding and conversion of chemical signal → electrical signal (postsynaptic potential)
    - Ionotropic receptors = Ion channels
        - Binding of the transmitter → Opening of the channel
        - High opening speed → Fast synaptic signal transmission
        - Inhibitory or excitatory effect
    - Metabotropic receptors
        - Binding of the transmitter → Activation of a G-protein
        - Direct or indirect opening of ion channels (via second messengers such as cAMP or IP3)
4. Postsynaptic potential (depending on the type of transmitter and postsynaptic receptor)
    - Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP):
        - Receptor binds excitatory (stimulating) neurotransmitters (e.g. glutamate, serotonin) → Opens cation channel → Na+ influx into postsynapse → Depolarization
    - Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)
        - Receptor binds inhibitory neurotransmitter (e.g. glycine, GABA) → Opens cation/anion channel → hyperpolarization
            - In GABAB receptors, hyperpolarization occurs due to: K+ efflux → IPSP down to -100 mV
            - In GABAA receptors and glycine receptors, hyperpolarization occurs through: Cl- influx → IPSP down to -70 mV
5. Reinforcement of the EPSP
    - Temporal Summation: If a subthreshold EPSP is transmitted in quick succession over one or more neighboring synapses, the currents add up to a suprathreshold EPSP
    - Spatial summation: If subthreshold EPSPs are simultaneously transmitted via several closely spaced synapses, they add up to a suprathreshold EPSP
6. Termination of signal transmission
    - Inactivation, degradation: Transmitter is inactivated in the synaptic cleft and degraded by enzymes (e.g., cleavage of acetylcholine → choline + acetate)
    - Reuptake: Transmitter is taken back up into the presynapse (e.g., norepinephrine)
    - Autoinhibition: Transmitter is bound by receptors in the presynapse, which inhibits further transmitter release there (e.g. presynaptic α2 receptors in noradrenergic synapses)

> [!NOTE]
> An EPSP is generally not sufficient to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. Many EPSPs are required for postsynaptic activity in the neuron! An exception is the motor end plate: Here, the EPSP is always suprathreshold and triggers an action potential in the muscle fiber.

> [!NOTE] Tetanus
> Tetanus (Lockjaw) is a life-threatening disease. It is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which is found in soil and typically enters the body through small wounds on the skin surface. Once inside the body, it produces the tetanus toxin, which is taken up by peripheral nerves and transported retrogradely along the axons to the spinal cord. At the synapses of inhibitory interneurons (so-called Renshaw cells), it destroys a protein that is responsible for the release of the transmitter glycine. As a result, there is unrestrained activity of the α-motoneurons and consequently, a sustained contraction of various muscles.

> [!NOTE] Excursus: "Virtual Lesions"
> By applying strong magnetic pulses through a coil directly at the surface of the head (transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS), the function of individual brain regions can be temporarily disrupted in a targeted manner – this is referred to as "virtual lesions." It is an established procedure for research purposes, through which, for example, important insights into the functional organization of the prefrontal cortex have been gained. Furthermore, TMS is used, for instance, in the treatment of therapy-resistant depressions.

## Afferents/Efferents

Nerve fibers transmit information in only one direction. Depending on where the excitation arises, one distinguishes between afferents and efferents. The excitation of afferents occurs in receptors of the peripheral nerve endings, while that of efferents occurs in a neuron of the CNS.

- Afferents: Nerve fibers that transmit information from the periphery of the body to the CNS
    - Somatosensory afferents
        - General somatosensory afferents: Transmit information from the skin and the striped muscles
        - Special somatosensory afferents: Transmit information from the retina and the inner ear
    - Viszeroafferences
        - General viszeroafferences: Transmit information from the organs and blood vessels
        - Special viszeroafferences: Transmit information for the olfactory and gustatory sense
- Efferents: Nerve fibers that transmit information from the CNS to the periphery of the body
    - Somatoafferents
        - General somatoafferents: Transmit information to the striated skeletal muscle
    - Visual differences
        - General viszeroefferenzes: Are autonomic and transmit information to the vessels, smooth muscle of the organs and glands.
        - Special viszeroefferenzen: They transmit information to the so-called branchiogenic muscles, which have embryologically developed from the gill arches
## Overview of Neurotransmitters

> [!NOTE] Schizophrenia
> It is suspected that increased activity of dopaminergic cell groups is at least partially responsible for some forms of schizophrenia. Based on this assumption, dopamine antagonists are used in pharmacological therapy. They cause the activity of dopamine at postsynaptic receptors to be reduced, thereby improving the symptoms of the affected individuals.

> [!NOTE] Drugs
> Some drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and hallucinogens increase, among other things, the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft, leading to stimulation of the dopamine-mediated reward system and thus to psychological dependence. The resulting positive association with the substance complicates therapy.

> [!NOTE] Depressive disorders
> Together with norepinephrine, serotonin regulates emotional processes, the sleep-wake cycle, and the pain-inhibiting system. In the context of depressive disorders, it is assumed that reduced activity of noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons plays a role. The main symptoms of depression (depressed mood, loss of interest, loss of motivation) can therefore be explained by a deficiency in serotonin and norepinephrine. Pharmacologically, medications such as selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRI) are used to attempt to increase the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Nervous Tissue, Synapses, and Transmitters
### Nervous Tissue

What are the so-called Nissl bodies?
- Nissl bodies correspond to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the perikaryon of nerve cells. They become visible as granular substance due to their basophilia by staining with basic dyes (so-called Nissl staining).

What characterizes the so-called subplasma membrane condensation zone of the axon?
- The subplasmalemmal condensation zone is located in the so-called initial segment. The initial segment is a short, non-myelinated axon section at the end of the axon hillock. The special feature of the subplasmalemmal condensation zone is a high density of sodium channels, which lowers the excitation threshold here and allows action potentials to be generated particularly easily.

What is the difference between dendrites and axons? Describe the structure of a dendrite!
- Dendrites and axons are nerve cell processes of neurons. Each neuron has exactly one axon, which conducts its signals and branches into numerous branches along its course. Dendrites serve to receive stimuli and emerge from nerve cell bodies in many tree-like branches. At their peripheral ends are so-called "spines," mushroom-shaped protrusions equipped with receptors, where the branches of axons of other nerve cells end and form a synapse (axodendritic synapse). The signals received at the synapses are transmitted via the dendrites to their nerve cell body.

With which histological staining can neurons be best represented?
- The histological representation of neurons is best achieved with a Golgi silver impregnation.

How does the fast anterograde and retrograde transport occur in the axon?
- Fast axonal transport can occur in two directions: In anterograde transport, vesicles filled with neurotransmitters are transported from the center (perikaryon) to the periphery (axon terminal) with the help of the motor protein kinesin. In retrograde transport, protein-containing vesicles are transported from the periphery back to the perikaryon with the help of the motor protein dynein.

What function do the ependymal cells have?
- Ependymal cells belong to the glial cells of the central nervous system and line the internal liquor spaces (brain ventricles and spinal canal).

Ganglia are clusters of perikarya (nerve cell bodies) in the peripheral nervous system, which also appear as nodular thickening of nerve strands. What are the cells that surround them called?
- The ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (especially spinal ganglia) are surrounded by satellite cells (also called mantle cells), which are flat cells with small, dark nuclei that belong to the glial cells.

Which cells produce particularly high amounts of acidic glial protein GFAP (engl. Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) and what clinical significance does this have?
- The acidic glial protein GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein) is produced especially by astrocytes, so clinically it can be used as a tumor marker in astrocytomas (GFAP is the main component of the intermediate filaments of glial cells in the CNS).

What histological characteristics can you identify sensory ganglia (such as spinal ganglia) by?
- Spinal ganglia can be recognized under the light microscope by the perikarya of the ganglion cells, which have large nuclei each with a prominent nucleolus. Their cytoplasm can appear finely granular due to Nissl bodies stained with acidic dyes. Each perikaryon is also wrapped by a glial sheath composed of many small satellite cells. The ganglion itself is surrounded by a connective tissue capsule.

Which ion channels, which are present in large numbers on neurons, are almost completely absent on astrocytes?
- Astrocytes are the most common glial cells of the central nervous system and have a variety of functions. The generation of an action potential is not among them, so they express only a small number of the voltage-dependent sodium channels required for this.

Describe the structure of a nerve fiber! Which cells are involved in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), and which in the central nervous system (CNS)?
- A nerve fiber consists of an axon and its associated glial sheath. The glial sheath is formed by the glial cells or their plasma membranes: in the CNS by oligodendrocytes, in the PNS by Schwann cells. Several layers of glial sheath wrap around an axon in a lamellar fashion, forming its myelin sheath.

How does the diameter of a nerve fiber relate to its conduction speed?
- The larger the diameter of a nerve fiber, the lower its longitudinal resistance and the higher its conduction velocity.

In which disease of the central nervous system does a deterioration of vision typically occur as the first symptom?
- Encephalomyelitis disseminata (multiple sclerosis, MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS and is associated with demyelinations in the brain and spinal cord. The optic nerve is phylogenetically derived from the diencephalon and can therefore also be affected. If its myelination is attacked by inflammatory processes, restricted visual acuity, reduced color perception, and orbital pain often occur as the first manifestation of this disease.

Which type of nerve fiber achieves the fastest conduction velocity and what is its speed?
- The afferent muscle spindle fibers and the efferent α-motoneurons (= Aα fibers) have a conduction velocity of about 60–120 m/s and are thus the fastest conducting nerve fibers.

How fast do the Aβ fibers conduct, and where can they be found?
- The Aβ fibers conduct at a speed of about 30–60 m/s and are responsible for transmitting afferent signals from skin receptors (e.g., touch, pressure).

Which two nerve fiber classes are responsible for the transmission of pain?
- The pain fibers of the body belong to the Aδ and C fibers, which are very thin with 3 μm and 1 μm respectively and consequently conduct signals relatively slowly. The Aδ fibers are responsible for early, sharp pain, the C fibers for late, dull pain.

### Synapses

How are electrical synapses structured?
- Electrical synapses are much rarer than chemical ones and transmit excitation between two cells via an ion current. They consist of a pre- and postsynaptic cell connected via gap junctions (nexus). The gap junctions consist of several transmembrane connexin protein complexes, the so-called connexons, which form a channel pore through which ions can flow.

Describe the function of the SNARE proteins! How are they activated?
- SNARE proteins are located in the presynaptic membrane of chemical synapses. As special subunits of membrane protein complexes, they play a key role in transmitter release. A depolarization-mediated increase in Ca2+ concentration in the presynaptic terminal is detected by synaptotagmin, which activates the SNARE proteins. The SNARE proteins of the neurotransmitter-filled vesicles (v-SNAREs, e.g., synaptobrevin) fuse with the SNARE proteins of the cell membrane (from English target, t-SNAREs), resulting in the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis.

What happens when two action potentials arrive at the presynapse in quick succession?
- When two action potentials arrive at the presynapse shortly one after the other, the Ca2+ influxes add up, leading to increased transmitter release and consequently a stronger signal at the postsynapse. This phenomenon is also called synaptic facilitation.

Name excitatory neurotransmitters and describe their mechanism of action!
- When excitatory (stimulating) neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, glutamate, or serotonin bind to the ligand-gated receptors of the postsynaptic membrane, a cation channel opens, allowing the influx of Na+ into the postsynapse. This causes depolarization and thus excitation.

Which ion do the neurotransmitters glycine and GABAA mediate their inhibitory effect?
- After activation of the glycine or GABAA receptor at the postsynapse, it opens to allow the influx of Cl- ions. The accompanying hyperpolarization of the cell increases the threshold for triggering an action potential and mediates the inhibitory effect of the two neurotransmitters.

### Overview of Neurotransmitters

Which neurotransmitters belong to the monoamines and which enzyme breaks them down?
- The neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, (nor)adrenaline, and histamine belong to the group of monoamines and are broken down by monoamine oxidase (MAO).

Which neurotransmitter system plays a special role in the development of a psychological drug addiction?
- The dopaminergic system influences psychological and behavioral processes (e.g., well-being as part of the reward system). Some drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, and hallucinogens increase, among other things, the dopamine concentration in the synaptic cleft, which leads to stimulation of the dopamine-mediated reward system and therefore to psychological dependence.

In a tetanus infection, there is an uncontrolled activity of the α-motoneurons and consequently a sustained contraction of various muscles. The release of which neurotransmitter is consequently disrupted by the tetanus toxin?
- The tetanus toxin inhibits the release of the α-motoneuron-inhibiting glycine by cleaving synaptobrevin, which is responsible for the fusion of glycine-containing vesicles with the cell membrane at the presynapse. The lack of inhibition on the α-motoneurons leads to muscle stiffness and cramps.

What are the functions of the neurotransmitter adenosine and nitric oxide (NO)?
- Adenosine has an inhibitory effect on the release of other neurotransmitters and promotes sleep in the hypothalamus. Nitric oxide is a gaseous transmitter that can diffuse retrogradely from the synaptic cleft into the presynapse and regulate the release of other neurotransmitters there.

Which psychiatric disorder is probably associated with an overactivity of the dopaminergic system?
- Overactivity of dopaminergic cell groups is suspected as a contributing cause of certain forms of schizophrenia. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that therapy with dopamine antagonists can lead to an improvement in symptoms.
