# Ovar
## Summary

The two ovaries (ovaries) play a key role in female sexual function: not only do they develop and provide egg cells, but they are also responsible for the synthesis of sex hormones. Thus, they are involved in regulating the female menstrual cycle and, if necessary, in maintaining an established pregnancy.

Microscopically, the ovaries consist of a connective tissue stroma and a cortical area where the ovarian follicles are located: these are responsible for the maturation of the egg cells and for the production of sex hormones. The ovaries are attached by several suspensory ligaments, which include the supplying blood vessels, among others. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on the ovary and fallopian tube in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the ovary.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Functions: Oogenesis, Follicle maturation, Ovulation, Hormone production
- Location: Paris, intraperitoneal in the ovarian fossa
- Form: Plum-shaped
- Size: 3 cm × 2 cm × 1 cm
- Weight: 7–14 g
- Areas and Edges
    - Tubal extremity (= upper pole)
    - Uterine extremity (= lower pole)
    - Margo mesovaricus (= anterior border)
    - Margo liber (= posterior margin)
    - Medial and lateral surfaces

### Structure

The ovary consists of four overlapping layers that perform different functions.

- From outside to inside is divided into:
    1. Peritoneum: The ovaries are mostly located intraperitoneally.
    2. Tunica albuginea: Thin organ capsule that extends with vessels and nerves into the depth of the ovary.
    3. Cortex ovarii (= Cortical zone): Dense connective tissue surrounds ovarian follicles at various stages of development.
    4. Medulla of the ovary (= medullary zone): Loose connective tissue with vessels and nerves

### Topography

The ovary lies intraperitoneally in the ovarian fossa (i.e., the ovarian pit) with its ligaments and the mesovarium.

#### Bands of the Ovary

The ovary is connected to the surrounding organs by three ligaments. These contain the vessels that supply the ovary.

- Suspensory ligament of the ovary
    - Course: Between the upper pole of the ovaries and the lateral pelvic wall
    - Contains: A. and V. ovarica
- Proper ovarian ligament
    - Course: Between the lower pole of the ovaries and the uterus
    - Contains: R. ovaricus of the A. uterina
- Mesovarium: Portion of the broad ligament of the uterus
    - Course: Along the margo mesovaricus (anterior border of the ovary)

#### Location Relationships

|Direction|Area|Adjacent Organ/Structure|
|---|---|---|
|Ventral|Medial surface|Alternating bowel loops|
|Dorsal|Lateral surface|Ovarian fossa with:<br><br>- A. umbilical artery<br>- A. obturator artery<br>- N. obturator nerve|
|Cranial|Mesovarian margin|Connected to the mesovarium with the uterine tube|
|Caudal|Free margin|Ureter|
|Lateral|Tubal extremity|Fimbriae funnel of the uterine tube|

> [!NOTE] Pain radiation in adnexitis
> The anatomical proximity to the obturator nerve can explain pain radiation to the inner side of the thighs in case of inflammation of the ovaries. When surgically removing the ovary, the arterial dual supply must be taken into account.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

|Vessel Supply|   |Particularities|
|---|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. ovarian from abdominal aorta|- Course<br>    - Branches shortly below the renal artery<br>    - Crosses over the ureter at the level of the navel<br>    - Course to the ovary in the suspensory ligament of the ovary|
|- Ovarian artery from the uterine artery arising from the internal iliac artery|- Course in the proper ovarian ligament|
|Venous|- Ovarian vein into the renal vein (left) or inferior vena cava (right)|- Course in the suspensory ligament of the ovary|
|Innervation|   |   |
|Autonomic nerve plexus| - Ovarian plexus|   |
|Lymphatic drainage|   |   |
|Lymph nodes|- Left lumbar lymph nodes (left)<br>- Intermediate lumbar lymph nodes (right)|   |

> [!NOTE]
> The ovary is supplied by two different arterial territories: A. ovarica from the aorta and lateral branches of the A. uterina from the internal iliac artery!

### Microscopic Anatomy

The ovary consists of a medulla and a cortex, which are surrounded by a thick connective tissue capsule and covered by a characteristic peritoneal coating. The following section presents the microscopic structure of the ovary and ovarian follicles.

### Histological Layers of the Ovary

|Layers<br><br>(from outside to inside)|Histological Features|
|---|---|
|Peritoneum|- Cuboidal mesothelium (also called Müller epithelium)|
|Tunica albuginea|- Tough, collagen-rich connective tissue capsule|
|Cortex of the ovary|- Spinozellular connective tissue: Cell-rich connective tissue with densely packed fibroblasts<br>- Ovarian follicle: Functional unit of the ovary (see below)<br>    - In the cortex lie both the follicle reserve (primordial follicles) and the further stages of development|
|Medulla of the ovary|- Loose connective tissue with vessels and nerves<br>- Hilus cells: Interstitial cells with endocrine activity|

> [!NOTE]
> The cubic mesothelium is a special form of the peritoneum and is only found in the ovary and testis!

### Ovarian Follicle

- Definition: The ovarian follicle consists of an egg cell surrounded by follicular epithelial cells and an outer layer of connective tissue.
- Location: Just beneath the surface in the cortex of the ovary
- General structure (from the inside out)
    - Female germ cell (= oocyte) (see: oogenesis)
    - Granulosa cells (= follicular epithelial cells)
        - Surround the oocytes directly and form the follicular cavity and the hormone-active stratum granulosum of the ovary.
        - Express the enzyme aromatase → Conversion of androgens to estrogens
        - Depending on the maturity of the follicle, it can be single or multilayered.
    - Theca cells: Outer layer of connective tissue that differentiates into the hormone-producing theca interna and connective tissue theca externa.

### Functions at a Glance

- Oogenesis: Development of mature egg cells from primordial germ cells
- Follicle maturation and atresia: Development of the ovarian follicle (egg + follicular cells) into a mature follicle ready for ovulation.
- Ovulation: Ovulation
- Endocrine gland: Hormone production
    - Menstrual Cycle
    - Formation of sex hormones (see: sex hormones)
    - Maintenance of pregnancy

## Oogenesis

The totality of female eggs is established before birth. They remain in a resting phase until puberty, until they hormonally mature further during a menstrual cycle (parallel to the surrounding follicle maturation). The development of the eggs (oogenesis) is interrupted a second time at ovulation and is only fully completed in the event of fertilization by a sperm.

### Stages of Oogenesis

|Stages|Time|Designation of germ cells, chromosome set and number of chromatids|Processes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Mitosis|- 4th week–7th month|- Germ cells/Oogonia: 2n2C|- Formation of germ cells in the yolk sac, migration to the gonadal ridge<br>- Mitoses: Clonal proliferation of oogonia<br>- Cytoplasmic bridges continue to connect the cell clones with each other|
|Beginning of Meiosis I|- Approximately from the 4th month|- Primary oocyte: 2n4C|- Resolution of cytoplasmic bridges<br>- Process of Prophase I to Diplotene → Transition to Dictyotene<br>- Follicle epithelial cells surround the oocytes → Formation of primordial follicles<br>- The female egg reserve is now fully established|
|1. Resting phase (Dictyotene)|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|Completion of Meiosis I / Beginning of Meiosis II|- From puberty: Just before ovulation|- Secondary oocyte: 1n2C|- Follicular phase: FSH-dependent follicle maturation → Oocyte remains in first resting phase (dictyate)<br>- Triggered by the LH peak continuation of Meiosis I<br>- Separation of the first polar body upon completion of Meiosis I<br>- Beginning of Meiosis II up to Metaphase II → Transition into second resting phase|
|2. Rest Phase|   |   |   |
|Completion of Meiosis II|- After fertilization|- Mature egg: 1n1C|- If the egg is fertilized by a sperm after ovulation, Meiosis II continues<br>- Separation of another polar body|

> [!NOTE]
> After birth, no new egg cells are formed!

### Polar bodies

- Only one mature egg develops from a primary oocyte (as opposed to spermiogenesis)
- The surplus genetic material is expelled during meiosis in the form of polar bodies.
- Polar bodies contain a complete haploid set of chromosomes, but very little cytoplasm → They quickly degenerate
- During meiosis, 2–3 polar bodies are formed.

> [!NOTE] Polkörper diagnosis
> Polkörper can provide information in prenatal diagnostics about possible discrepancies in the chromosome set (unequal distribution of chromatids). Discrepancies predominantly arise during the first meiotic division, with a smaller proportion occurring during the second meiotic division.

## Follicle maturation and atresia

### Follicle Maturation

During the maturation of the egg cells, the ovarian follicles established during the fetal period change. Independently of the cycle, the primordial follicles develop in groups (so-called cohorts) into tertiary follicles. These mature during each menstrual cycle of the woman, but only one follicle develops into the dominant Graaf follicle in the last days before ovulation. The remaining follicles regress (follicular atresia). In general, follicular maturation includes five stages:

| Follicular maturation in the ovary |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

> [!NOTE]
> Follicle selection: During each menstrual cycle, several tertiary follicles mature; however, around the 7th day of the menstrual cycle, only one is selected as the dominant follicle! This follicle becomes a mature Graaf follicle in the final days before ovulation, while the other follicles degenerate!

### Follicular Atresia

In the ovaries rests a reserve of ovarian follicles, of which only a very small percentage mature into fertilizable eggs. All other ovarian follicles regress independently of the follicle stage throughout a woman's life, a process known as follicular atresia. At certain points in life, the reserve decreases significantly.

- Definition: Regression or degeneration of ovarian follicles regardless of the follicle stage to atretic follicles.
- Timing: Throughout a woman's life (peaking during fetal time, after birth, and at menarche)
- Number of follicles per ovary
    - 20. SSW: ∼ 7,000,000
    - Birth: ∼ 1,000,000
    - Menarche: ∼ 400,000
    - Fertilizable eggs considered over a lifetime: ∼ 400
## Ovulation

### Process of Ovulation

On average, every 28 days, a dominant follicle becomes mature in a sexually mature woman. Ovulation occurs, during which the follicle releases the egg. Ovulation proceeds in the following steps:

1. Increase in size: Secretion of follicular fluid into the antrum of the Graaf follicle → Increase in pressure in the antrum → Bulging at the surface of the ovary
2. Detachment of the cumulus oophorus from the follicle wall
3. Follicle rupture: Tear of the follicle wall as well as the capsule and the peritoneum of the ovary.
4. Oocyte enters the intraperitoneal cavity.
5. The fimbriae of the fallopian tube capture the egg.
6. The egg cell migrates through the uterine tube into the uterus.

### Formation of the Corpus Luteum

The ruptured follicular cavity changes after the release of the egg:

1. Corpus rubrum: The emptied follicle cavity is compressed by the surrounding tissue and bleeds into it.
2. Corpus luteum (=yellow body): hormonally active yellow body; arises from transformation of the corpus rubrum
    - Granular layer and theca interna become larger; ingrowth of blood vessels; lipid storage → yellow discoloration
        1. Cells of the theca interna become thecalutein cells → Androgen production
        2. Granulosa cells are converted into luteal granulosa cells: Conversion of androgens → progestins/estradiol
    - Corpus luteum graviditatis: Fertilization of the egg → Pregnancy → The corpus luteum takes over the production of pregnancy-sustaining sex hormones in the first 3 months.
    - Corpus luteum menstruationis: No fertilization of the egg → After 2 weeks, it regresses to the corpus albicans
3. Corpus albicans (=white body): Regressed corpus luteum, non-functional
## Review Questions for the Chapter Ovar
### Macroscopic Anatomy

In which of the ovarian suspensory ligaments do the ovarian arteries and veins run?
- The ovarian vessels run in the ligamentum suspensorium ovarii, which extends between the upper pole of the ovary and the lateral pelvic wall.
Where does the ligamentum ovarii proprium extend from and to?
- The ligamentum ovarii proprium extends from the lower pole of the ovary to the uterine tube angle of the uterus.
How is the venous vascular supply of the ovary? Where does it drain?
- The ovary is supplied venously by the ovarian vein (V. ovarica). On the right side, it drains directly into the inferior vena cava (V. cava inferior), while on the left side it drains into the renal vein (V. renalis), which then empties into the inferior vena cava.
### Microscopic Anatomy

Where is the so-called Müller epithelium located?
- The Müller epithelium is the simple cuboidal peritoneal epithelium. It forms the mesothelium, the outermost layer of the intraperitoneal ovary.
Where in the ovary are the ovarian follicles located?
- Regardless of their follicular stage, all ovarian follicles are located in the ovarian cortex.
### Oogenesis

When does the mitotic proliferation of germ cells occur in women? What are the germ cells called when mitosis is completed?
- In women, the entire mitotic proliferation of germ cells occurs before birth. Once mitosis is complete, the germ cells are called primary oocytes.
What does the dictyotene phase describe and what brings it to an end?
- The dictyotene phase is the resting phase of meiosis entered by the primary oocytes after the beginning of the first meiotic division (meiosis I). They remain in this stage in the ovaries for many years until shortly before ovulation when the resting phase ends and meiosis I is completed.
What are so-called primordial follicles?
- Primordial follicles are primary oocytes surrounded by follicular epithelial cells. In this form, the oocytes enter the dictyotene phase.
### Follicle maturation and atresia

What is a Graaf follicle?
- A Graaf follicle is a mature, dominant tertiary follicle ready to ovulate. It is selected around the 7th day of the menstrual cycle from the maturing tertiary follicles, while the remaining tertiary follicles degenerate.
What is the zona pellucida?
- The zona pellucida is a clearly defined protective layer of the oocyte from the secondary follicle stage onward. It is also called the glass membrane and consists of glycoproteins.
### Ovulation

How does the ruptured follicle cavity develop after ovulation?
- After ovulation, the follicle cavity bleeds, forming the corpus rubrum. This develops further into the hormonally active corpus luteum (yellow body), which produces pregnancy-maintaining hormones during the first three months of pregnancy. If fertilization of the oocyte does not occur, the corpus luteum directly transforms into the non-functional corpus albicans (white body).
