# Mineral
## Summary

Minerals are essential nutrients that must be supplied through food and perform important functions in the human body. Minerals are classified into major elements and trace elements: Major elements (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium) are present in the body at a concentration of over 50 mg/kg of body weight, while the concentration of trace elements (e.g., iron, iodine, copper) does not exceed 50 mg/kg of body weight.

The trace elements each fulfill very specific functions. Most of the time, they are components of proteins and often serve as cofactors for enzymes (similar to vitamins). Iron, for example, is a component of heme and in this form is the most important storage and transport medium for oxygen; copper is a cofactor for numerous redox enzymes, and iodine is an important component of thyroid hormones.

If trace elements are not adequately supplied through food or if there are absorption disorders, deficiency symptoms occur. Very often, for example, there is an iron deficiency, which manifests as microcytic, hypochromic anemia, or an iodine deficiency, which leads to the formation of a goiter (colloquially: "thyroid") .

## General Information and Overview Table

- Trace elements: Minerals whose concentration in the body is below 50 mg/kg body weight (e.g., iron, copper, zinc, iodine, and selenium)
- Major elements: Mineral substances that are present in the body in a concentration of over 50 mg/kg of body weight (e.g. calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, chlorine, and sulfur)

> Superoxide dismutase contains both copper and zinc!

## Iron

Iron (Fe2+, Fe3+) is the most common trace element in the human body. Unlike other metal ions, it can react not only with anions but also with neutral molecules (e.g., O2). Thus, iron serves as a cofactor for heme-containing enzymes and proteins, making it the most important transport and storage medium for oxygen.

### General

- Requirement: Approx. 10 mg per day
- Amount and distribution in the organism
    - Quantity: 5–7 g
    - Distribution: Hemoglobin (about 70%), Myoglobin (about 10%), Ferritin/Hemosiderin (about 15%), Remaining: Enzymes, Transferrin, Cytochrome
- Iron in food
    - Sources: Plant-based and animal-based foods, especially liver, wheat bran, pumpkin seeds, sesame, quinoa, amaranth
    - Presence: Bound to food proteins (Hemoglobin, Myoglobin)

> [!NOTE]
> Reducing and antioxidant substances (such as ascorbic acid) facilitate the absorption of iron, while complexing agents (such as tannins in tea and coffee) hinder it!

### Resorption and Transport

- Resorption of iron: The enterocytes preferentially absorb Fe2+, but can also take up Fe3+.
    - Stomach: Release of iron from its protein binding by HCl and pepsin
    - Absorption in the intestine: In the intestine, there are three different absorption pathways for iron. Iron can be absorbed either as a free ion or bound to heme (the most efficient absorption).
        1. DMT1-(Divalent-Metal-Transporter-1) Pathway: Resorption of Fe2+ through H+-coupled transport
        2. HCP-1-(Heme-Carrier-Protein-1‑)pathway (also briefly: Heme-pathway): Absorption of heme-bound iron via the heme transporter HCP-1
        3. MIP (Mobilferrin-Integrin-Pathway): Resorption of Fe3+
    - In enterocytes: Binding to mobilferrin
- Iron transport in the blood: Iron is transported in the blood as transferrin.
    - Formation of transferrins
        1. Release of Fe2+ via ferroportin from the enterocytes into the blood
        2. Oxidation to Fe3+ by Hephaestin
        3. Binding of Fe3+ to the transport protein apotransferrin Apotransferrin + Fe3+ → Transferrin
            - Normally, about 20–50% of transferrin is loaded with iron.
- Uptake into target cells: When a cell requires iron, it expresses increased transferrin receptors (TfR) on its surface.
    - Recording via the TfR-1
        1. Binding of transferrin to the TfR-1
        2. Endocytosis of the Transferrin/TfR-1 Complex
        3. Dissolution of the complex in the lysosome
            - Fe3+ is released into the cytosol
            - Apotransferrin is released back into the plasma.
            - TfR is reinserted into the plasma membrane.

> [!NOTE]
> The majority of the plasma iron (about 80%) reaches the bone marrow and is directly incorporated into hemoglobin there!

#### Iron storage and excretion

After being released from transferrin, iron is either immediately incorporated into proteins and enzymes or stored as ferritin. Another, rarer storage form of iron is hemosiderin.

- Main storage sites: Hepatocytes as well as the reticuloendothelial cells of bone marrow and spleen
- Storage Forms
    - Ferritin: Fe3+ + Apoferritin
        - Release: The ferritin reductase releases individual Fe2+ ions from ferritin.
    - Hemoglobin: Protein complex that contains iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)3)
        - Release: The iron stored in hemosiderin is much less mobilizable than the iron from ferritin.
            - Siderosomes: Intracellular granules that consist of hemosiderin and can be microscopically visualized with Prussian blue staining.
- Excretion: Iron is primarily produced in the body during the breakdown of hemoglobin, with the majority being recycled.
    - Excretion through the intestines (shed epithelial cells), the kidneys, and sweat (approximately 1–2 mg per day in total)

> [!NOTE]
> Hemosiderin is classified as one of the iron storage forms, but in fact, it seems to be more of a breakdown product of, for example, hemoglobin. This also explains why hemosiderin iron is so poorly mobilized!

> [!NOTE]
> Women are significantly more affected by iron deficiency than men: During menstruation, about 10–15 mg of iron is additionally lost, but this is typically easily compensated for by increased iron absorption. During pregnancy, although menstruation is absent, the body's iron requirement increases to about double due to the increased blood production!

> [!NOTE] Labor value Ferritin
> A part of the ferritin is not stored in the cells but is released into the plasma. This part is proportional to the total ferritin content. Plasma ferritin thus serves as an indicator of the body's iron reserves (see also: laboratory parameters of iron metabolism).

> [!NOTE] Iron deficiency
> Iron deficiency is the most common deficiency disease in humans worldwide. The causes of the deficiency can vary greatly, with heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, and malnutrition being the most common reasons. A rare cause is, for example, a congenital transferrin deficiency (congenital hypotransferrinemia), which restricts the transport of iron to the target cells. Clinically, iron deficiency manifests as iron deficiency anemia (microcytic, hypochromic). Additionally, it is associated with specific changes (angular cheilitis, nail and hair changes).

> [!NOTE] Heart defect cells
> Hemosiderin is particularly commonly found in macrophages and usually where blood has entered the tissue. In the case of left heart failure, for example, there is a backup of blood into the lungs. The resident alveolar macrophages phagocytize the pathologically leaked erythrocytes and digest them. As a digestion product, hemosiderin remains, which can be demonstrated in the Prussian blue stain. These macrophages are then referred to as heart failure cells.

#### Function

Iron is the central atom of heme and thus an important cofactor of heme-containing enzymes and proteins. However, there are also non-heme enzymes that rely on iron as a cofactor.

- Hem-containing enzymes/proteins
    - Myoglobin (O2-binding and storage)
    - Hemoglobin (O2 transport)
    - Cytochrome of the respiratory chain (electron transport)
- Non-heme iron enzymes
    - Peroxidase (Detoxification of hydrogen peroxide)
    - Catalase (Detoxification of hydrogen peroxide)
    - Ribonucleotide reductase (Reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides)

#### Regulation of Iron Metabolism

- Regulation of absorption: Depending on the iron content of the enterocytes, about 5–40% of dietary iron is absorbed in the duodenum.
    - Mukosablock: When the iron binding capacity of the plasma is exhausted, ferritin iron is deposited in the enterocytes → inhibition of absorption
    - The export of iron from enterocytes into the blood can be inhibited by the peptide hormone hepcidin by binding to ferroportin, after which the ferroportin/hepcidin complex is taken up into the cell and degraded.
        - The synthesis of hepcidin in the liver is therefore induced by an increased iron concentration.
        - Hepcidin additionally inhibits the Ferroportin-dependent mobilization of iron from the iron stores of macrophages.
- Regulation of metabolism
    - mRNAs of apoferritin and TfR have a stable stem-loop structure in their inactive form, the so-called "iron response element" (IRE)
    - The translation of both is regulated by the binding of the so-called "iron-response-element-binding-protein" (IRE-BP)
        - With sufficient iron concentration: IRE-BP binds iron and is active as cytosolic aconitase in this state.
        - At low iron concentration, the IRE-BP binds to the IRE. Consequences:
            1. Inhibition of translation of apoferritin
            2. Activation of the translation of the TfR

> [!NOTE]
> The cytosolic aconitase should not be confused with the mitochondrial aconitase, which is an enzyme of the citric acid cycle!

## Copper

- Requirement: 1.0–1.5 mg per day
- Quantity and distribution in the organism
    - Quantity: 100–150 mg
    - Distribution: Mostly in the liver
- Copper in food
    - Sources: Whole grain products, legumes, sunflower seeds
- Resorption, Transport, and Storage
    - Absorption in the small intestine: Occurs in an energy-dependent manner
    - Transport in the blood to the liver: Bound to albumin and transcuprein
    - Uptake into hepatocytes: Through the specific copper transporter CTR1 (Cu2+-ATPase)
        - In hepatocytes: Reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+
    - Transport via Wilson transporter (ATP7B) into the Golgi apparatus
    - Storage: In the form of ceruloplasmin in liver cells (Apo-Ceruloplasmin + Cu+ → Ceruloplasmin)
        - If necessary: Submission into the blood
- Excretion: Through vesicles into the bile and thus into the intestine
- Function: As a strong oxidizing agent, Cu2+ is a cofactor for numerous oxidases, e.g.:
    - Cytochrome c Oxidase
    - Lysyl-Oxidase
    - Superoxide Dismutase

> [!NOTE]
> Copper and iron metabolism are closely linked - copper is required for both iron absorption and the physiological utilization of iron (e.g., incorporation into hemoglobin)!

> [!NOTE] Wilson's Disease
> Wilson's disease is a hereditary condition in which the excretion of copper through bile is disturbed due to a mutation of the Wilson protein. As a result, copper accumulates in the liver. Additionally, excess copper is released into the blood in the form of free copper, thus reaching all other organs as well. These deposits can also be found in the cornea. They are of particular diagnostic significance, as they become visible as the pathognomonic "Kayser-Fleischer ring." If left untreated, it leads to liver inflammation (hepatitis) and, in the final stage, to liver cirrhosis. Moreover, copper in the blood can have a direct toxic effect and, for example, trigger hemolytic anemias. Therapeutically, chelating agents are used that bind copper and promote its excretion through the kidneys.

## Zinc

- Requirement: approx. 10–15 mg per day
- Amount and distribution in the organism
    - Quantity: approx. 2–3 g
    - Distribution: 99% intracellular

    - Sources: Offal, fish, seafood, red meat, wheat
- Resorption and Transport
    - Absorption in the intestine: Via an energy-dependent zinc transporter
    - Transport in the blood: Bound to albumin
    - Uptake into target cells: Via specific zinc transporters (ZnT)

        - Alkaline Phosphatase
        - Carbonic anhydrase
        - Superoxide Dismutase
    - Component of regulatory DNA-binding proteins ("zinc finger")
    - Complex formation with insulin
    - Involvement in androgen synthesis (especially testosterone)

> [!NOTE]
> Zinc cannot be stored in the body!

> [!NOTE] Zinc deficiency, Acrodermatitis enteropathica
> A zinc deficiency can occur acutely in infections, inflammations, and stress situations, and chronically, for example, due to dietary errors or liver cirrhosis. The leading symptom is impaired wound healing, as zinc plays an important role in the keratinization process of the skin and the production of connective tissue. In addition to this acquired zinc deficiency, there is also – very rarely – congenital zinc deficiency: In the so-called acrodermatitis enteropathica, there is a defect in the zinc ion transporter gene, which leads to absorption disorders. The disease manifests already in infancy, and in addition to impaired wound healing, there are also chronic diarrhea and growth disturbances with crusty, blistering skin manifestations. The therapy consists of lifelong zinc supplementation.

- Function
    - Component of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine)

> [!NOTE] Goiter due to iodine deficiency
> Iodine deficiency usually results from a lack of intake through food and leads to a reduced synthesis of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). The body responds to this with an increased release of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), causing the tissue to expand, which becomes visible as a goiter (or colloquially: "throat"). Other symptoms include disturbances in growth and intellectual development.

## Selen

- Function: In the form of the amino acid selenocysteine, selenium is a component of enzymes, e.g.:
    - Glutathione Peroxidase
    - Thyroxin-5'-Deiodase

> [!NOTE]
> The most important function of selenium is the defense against oxidative stress!

## Review Questions for the Chapter on Minerals
### Iron

How much of the iron taken in with food is approximately absorbed by the intestine, and in what form can it be absorbed most efficiently?
- Depending on the current iron requirement of the body, about 5–40% of the ingested dietary iron is absorbed in the intestine. This can occur via three absorption pathways, the most efficient of which is the so-called heme pathway, i.e., the uptake of heme-bound iron.
Which substances typically facilitate iron absorption in the intestines and why?
- Enterocytes preferentially absorb iron ions in their reduced form (Fe2+). The simultaneous intake of reducing and antioxidative substances such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with iron promotes the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and thereby facilitates absorption.
Describe the pathway of iron ions from the intestinal lumen into the blood and to the extraintestinal tissue!
- Enterocytes take up iron ions in their reduced form (Fe2+) from the intestinal lumen via the Divalent Metal Transporter 1 (DMT1). On the basolateral side, Fe2+ is released into the blood via ferroportin, where oxidation to Fe3+ occurs through hephaestin. The trivalent iron then binds to apotransferrin: transport iron transferrin is formed, which transports the iron ions to the extraintestinal tissues.
What does the so-called transferrin saturation describe and how high is it approximately in a healthy individual?
- The majority of iron in the blood plasma is bound to transferrin. Transferrin saturation describes the proportion of iron-loaded transferrin relative to total transferrin and is determined when there is suspicion of iron deficiency. In a healthy individual, it is approximately 20–50%.
What influence does iron deficiency have on the shape of erythrocytes?
- Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. In iron deficiency, insufficient hemoglobin can be produced; the existing erythrocytes are therefore loaded with less hemoglobin. They appear microcytic (reduced volume) and hypochromic (reduced hemoglobin content) in blood smears.
How is iron stored in the body?
- After its uptake from the intestine, iron is either directly utilized or stored in the form of ferritin primarily in the cells of the liver, bone marrow, and spleen.
How is iron absorption in the intestine and iron export from enterocytes into the blood regulated?
- Enterocytes can always adjust iron absorption to the current demand. If there is an increased total iron content, the iron content in the enterocytes is also elevated – absorption is correspondingly reduced (so-called mucosal block). An increased iron concentration also stimulates the synthesis of hepcidin in the liver. In the intestine, hepcidin binds to the membrane transporter ferroportin and induces its degradation; as a result, iron export from the enterocytes into the blood is reduced.
Explain the function of cytosolic aconitase in the regulation of iron metabolism!
- Cytosolic aconitase is an important regulatory protein of iron metabolism. When the iron content in the cell is sufficiently high, cytosolic aconitase binds iron and catalyzes as an enzyme the conversion of citrate to isocitrate. When the iron content decreases, aconitase loses its iron and now functions as the so-called Iron Response Element Binding Protein (IRE-BP). It binds to mRNA and thus influences the translation of the transferrin receptor (TfR) and apoferritin. Under the influence of IRE-BP, TfR is expressed more, allowing more iron to be taken up into the cell. To simultaneously make more free iron available, the synthesis of apoferritin is reduced mediated by IRE-BP, so that less iron can be stored.
### Copper and Zinc

Copper and zinc are components or cofactors of numerous enzymes. Which erythrocyte enzyme contains both copper and zinc?
- Copper serves as a strong oxidizing agent and cofactor for numerous oxidases (e.g., cytochrome c oxidase), zinc is, among other things, an important component of dehydrogenases. Together, they are found in superoxide dismutase, which especially in erythrocytes serves to detoxify toxic oxygen radicals (superoxide O2-).
How is excess copper excreted?
- In case of copper excess, hepatocytes secrete vesicles containing copper via the so-called Wilson channels into the bile canaliculi, from where it is excreted through the intestines.
