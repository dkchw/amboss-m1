# Introduction to Immunology
## Summary

The human being is in constant exchange with the environment, for example, in the context of respiration or food intake, and is thus constantly exposed to pathogens from the environment. These interfaces between humans and the environment are protected by various mechanisms such as gastric acid or the ciliary movement of the respiratory epithelium directed towards the mouth. Furthermore, there exists a complex system of soluble factors and cells that protect the human body from pathogens â€“ the immune system. It can be divided into two systems: the rapidly responding, but non-specific innate immune system and the slower acting, but highly specific acquired immune system. Both systems are inseparably linked and work together in pathogen defense. Additionally, the specific immune system is capable of developing an immunological memory to combat reinfections significantly faster.
## Overview: Tasks and Functions

The immune system protects the body from pathogens and consists of cells and soluble (= humoral) factors. It can be divided into a so-called innate immune system that is present at birth and an adaptive immune system that develops throughout life. The innate immune system uses simple but rapid mechanisms to combat pathogens immediately upon their entry. In contrast, the adaptive immune system takes hours to days to fight pathogens. However, it is significantly more specific and effective and can develop an immunological memory.

The cells of both parts of the immune system are called leukocytes. These develop from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and mature either there or in lymphatic organs such as the thymus. After their maturation, leukocytes circulate either in the blood, lymph, or peripheral tissue.

### Lymphatic Organs and Vessels

- Primary lymphatic organs
    - Organs: Bone marrow and thymus
    - Function: Production and maturation of immune cells
- Secondary lymphatic organs
    - Organs: Spleen, lymph nodes, and MALT system
    - Functions
        - Site of antigen presentation by professional antigen-presenting cells as well as antigen recognition by "patrolling" naive lymphocytes.
        - Differentiation of mature, yet naive lymphocytes into effector cells
- Lymphatic system: Transports lymph fluid as well as the antigens and immune cells contained within it.

### Nonspecific Immune System (= Innate Immune System)

- Definition: Includes a variety of physical, chemical, cellular, and soluble (= humoral) defense mechanisms against pathogens that are present at birth.
- Functions
    - Initial, rapid, and nonspecific (as it is antigen-independent) pathogen defense
    - Effector arm of many functions of the specific immune system
- Composition
    - Cells
        - Granulocytes
            - Neutrophil Granulocytes
            - Eosinophilic Granulocytes
            - Basophilic Granulocytes
        - Professional antigen-presenting cells
            - Mononuclear phagocyte system (= MPS): Monocytes/Macrophages
            - Dendritic Cells
            - B lymphocytes are also antigen-presenting cells, but they are classified as part of the specific immune system.
        - Natural killer cells (= NK cells)
        - Mast cells
    - Soluble (= humoral) components
        - Soluble proteins on mucous membranes (e.g., lysozyme, lactoferrin, defensins, or surfactant proteins)
        - Complement system
        - Acute-phase proteins

### Specific Immune System (= adaptive or acquired immune system)

- Definition: Includes both cellular and humoral defense mechanisms that only become fully functional some time after birth.
- Functions
    - Slower, but highly specific (due to antigen dependence) and effective pathogen defense by:
        - Direct neutralization (e.g., the direct neutralization of free virus particles by antibodies)
        - Control and enhancement of the capabilities of cells of the nonspecific immune system
    - Establishment of an immunological memory
- Composition
    - Cells
        - T-Lymphocytes
            - CD4+ T helper cells
                - TH1 cells
                - TH2 cells
            - CD8+-effector cells (= cytotoxic T cells)
            - Other subtypes include, among others: TH17 cells, follicular T cells (TFH cells), and regulatory T cells (Treg cells)
        - B-lymphocytes: Plasma cells
    - Soluble (= humoral) components: antibodies (= immunoglobulins)

## Overview: Differences

Both parts of the immune system must recognize pathogens in order to fend them off. They use different mechanisms for this purpose. The cells of the nonspecific immune system can attack pathogens upon first contact. In addition to directly killing pathogens or degenerate cells, they also initiate the specific immune response. The cells of the specific immune system recognize pathogens by means of so-called antigens.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Introduction to Immunology
Compare the specific and nonspecific immune systems regarding the speed of their activation upon first or repeated contact with an antigen!
- The nonspecific immune system responds immediately upon first contact with an antigen with an immediate immune defense. However, no immunological memory is formed, so the response upon repeated contact with the same antigen proceeds at the same speed. The specific immune system responds more slowly upon first contact with an antigen but more effectively than the nonspecific immune system (so-called primary response). In addition, B memory cells are formed, which are reactivated upon repeated contact with the already known antigen and enable a significantly faster immune defense (secondary response).

What phases of the immune response to an unknown antigen exist, and what is the approximate timeframe for their progression?
- The nonspecific immune system responds immediately upon first contact with an antigen with an immediate immune defense. However, no immunological memory is formed, so the response upon repeated contact with the same antigen proceeds at the same speed. The specific immune system responds more slowly upon first contact with an antigen but more effectively than the nonspecific immune system (so-called primary response). In addition, B memory cells are formed, which are reactivated upon repeated contact with the already known antigen and enable a significantly faster immune defense (secondary response).

Which cells can be assigned to the nonspecific and specific immune system, respectively?
- Both the cells of the nonspecific and those of the specific immune system belong to the leukocytes. The nonspecific immune system includes granulocytes, monocytes or macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and mast cells. The (T and B) lymphocytes are the cells of the specific immune system.
