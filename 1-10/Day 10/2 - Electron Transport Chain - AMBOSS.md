# Electron Transport Chain
## Summary

A large part of the energy generated in the citric acid cycle and in the breakdown reactions of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins is temporarily stored intracellularly in the form of the reduction equivalents NADH+H+ and FADH2. In the respiratory chain, these reducing agents are oxidized. The energy released during this process is then used to synthesize the universal energy carrier ATP. In this process, the body takes advantage of the energy production from exergonic redox reactions: through an electron transport chain in the mitochondrial membrane, the electrons of the reduction equivalents are directed towards the oxygen in the mitochondrial matrix, where they ultimately combine to form H2O. The energy released during this process is used to establish a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. During the return flow of protons into the mitochondrial matrix, ATP synthesis takes place. This mechanism is also referred to as "oxidative phosphorylation."
## Overview

The electron transport chain consists of four large protein complexes, all located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Their function is to transport electrons through a series of exergonic redox reactions; they accomplish this with a variety of prosthetic groups.

- Goal: "Oxidative Phosphorylation," i.e., the synthesis of ATP using the energy released during the oxidation of the reducing equivalents NADH+H+ and FADH2.
- Location: Inner mitochondrial membrane, mitochondrial matrix
    - The inner mitochondrial membrane contains various transporters for substances that are needed, among other things, in the respiratory chain, e.g., the malate-aspartate shuttle, which indirectly transports NADH+H+ into the matrix.
- Starting materials: The reduction equivalents NADH+H+ and FADH2
- Principle
    - The electrons of the reduction equivalents are transported through the complexes of the respiratory chain (Complex I → Complex II → Complex III → Complex IV; so-called electron transport chain)
    - The energy released in the process is used to create a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
    - These protons flow back into the mitochondrion through a proton channel; the energy released in the process is used to synthesize ATP.
## Functioning of the Respiratory Chain

### Fundamental Principle

1. Electron transport chain
    - An electron transport chain consists of a series of redox molecules arranged in sequence.
        - These can both take in and give off electrons.
    - The electrons fall from higher to lower energy levels in such a chain, which releases energy in the process.
    - In the respiratory chain: The electron transport chain is formed by the complexes of the respiratory chain.
        - Four electrons from the respiratory chain are transferred to oxygen, which is then reduced to water.
        - Flow of electrons
            - NADH+H+ → Complex I → Complex III → Complex IV → Oxygen
            - FADH2 → Complex II → Complex III → Complex IV → Oxygen
2. Establishment of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane: The energy released during the "fall" of electrons is used by the complexes of the electron transport chain to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space (data for the transport of two electrons).
    - Complex I: Pumps four protons into the intermembrane space
    - Complex II: Does not have a proton pump function
    - Complex III: Pumps two protons into the intermembrane space (an additional two protons are also released into the intermembrane space)
    - Complex IV: Pumps two protons into the intermembrane space
3. Oxidative Phosphorylation
    - Protons flow along the gradient through a proton channel back into the mitochondrial matrix.
    - The proton channel is part of the ATP synthase, which - as the name suggests - catalyzes the synthesis of ATP.

#### Complex I (NADH-Ubiquinone-Oxidoreductase)

Complex I consists of over 30 subunits, making it the largest complex of the electron transport chain. Its function is to transfer two protons and two electrons from NADH+H+ to ubiquinone. For this purpose, the complex requires various prosthetic groups.

- Prosthetic Groups
    - FMN (Flavin mononucleotide)
    - Iron-sulfur cluster
    - Ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q)
- Process
    1. The 2 protons and 2 electrons are transferred from NADH+H+ to FMN.
        - NADH+H+ + FMN → NAD+ + FMNH2
    2. The two electrons are now transferred from FMN to an iron-sulfur cluster. The two protons are returned to the mitochondrial matrix.
        - 2Fe3+ + 2e- → 2Fe2+
    3. The two electrons are transferred from the iron-sulfur cluster to ubiquinone. Additionally, ubiquinone also takes up two protons from the matrix.
        - 2Fe2+ + 2H+ + Ubiquinone → 2Fe3+ + Ubiquinol

> [!NOTE]
> With the help of the energy produced by the electron flow in Complex I, 4 protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space!

#### Complex II (Succinate-Ubiquinone-Oxidoreductase)

Complex II includes succinate dehydrogenase and thus forms a direct interface between the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Its function is to transfer protons and electrons from FADH2 to ubiquinone. Unlike Complex I, Complex II does not pump protons into the intermembrane space. This explains why fewer ATP molecules are produced per molecule of FADH2 compared to per molecule of NADH+H+.

- FADH2 + Ubiquinone (Q) → FAD + Ubiquinol (QH2)

> [!NOTE]
> Complex II does not pump protons into the intermembrane space and is therefore not involved in the formation of the proton gradient. This explains why less ATP is produced per molecule of FADH2 than per molecule of NADH+H+!

#### Complex III (Ubiquinone-Cytochrome c-Oxidoreductase)

Complex III is a dimer, with each monomer consisting of 11 subunits. Its function is to transfer electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c in the so-called Q-cycle. Additionally, it transports the protons from ubiquinol into the intermembrane space. In contrast to ubiquinone, cytochrome c can only accept one electron, which is why the Q-cycle consists of two phases.

- Prosthetic Groups
    - Cytochrome b and c1
    - Iron-sulfur cluster (so-called Rieske center)
    - Two binding sites for ubiquinone (Qi and Qa)
        - Qi: Inner binding site (facing the matrix)
        - Qa: Outer binding site (facing the intermembrane space)

> [!NOTE]
> Complex III pumps 2 protons into the intermembrane space using the energy generated by the flow of electrons. Additionally, for 2 electrons, 2 more protons are released into the intermembrane space by ubiquinol (QH2) (so, there are a total of 4 protons per Q-cycle)!

> [!NOTE]
> A reduced cytochrome c molecule transports one electron to the cytochrome c oxidase!

#### Complex IV (Cytochrome c Oxidase)

Complex IV catalyzes the reoxidation of reduced cytochrome c and the reduction of oxygen to H2O.

- Prosthetic Groups
    - Häm a and Häm a3: Same structure, differ only in function.
    - Copper centers CuA2+ and CuB2+

> [!NOTE]
> Equation for the reaction of Complex IV: 4Cyt cred + O2 + 8H+Matrix → 4Cyt cox + 2H2O + 4H+Intermembrane space!

> [!NOTE]
> Complex IV pumps another 2 protons into the intermembrane space!

#### Reactive Intermediates

- In the respiratory chain (Complex I and III) as well as in the final transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen (Complex IV), small amounts of cell-toxic superoxide anions (O2-) are formed and released. These are neutralized by two antioxidant enzymes.
    - Superoxide dismutase: Converts superoxide anions into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.
        - 2O2- + 2H+ → H2O2 + O2
    - Catalase: Converts hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water.
        - 2H2O2 → O2 + 2H2O

## Oxidative Phosphorylation

During the transport of electrons across the complexes of the electron transport chain, protons are pumped into the intermembrane space, thus creating a proton gradient across the membrane. In oxidative phosphorylation, the energy released when this electrochemical potential difference is balanced (that is, when protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix) can be used to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi.

### The ATP Synthase

The ATP synthase consists of two subunits. One forms a proton channel through the inner mitochondrial membrane, while the other is responsible for the synthesis of ATP.

- FO-Subunit
    - Structure: Ring-shaped
    - Location: Anchored in the mitochondrial membrane
    - Function: Forms a proton channel through the membrane
- F1-Subunit
    - Structure
        - Ring-shaped, consists of five subunits (α, β, γ, δ, ε)
        - Contains a total of three active centers
    - Location: Attached to the matrix side of the FO subunit
    - Function: ATP synthesis

### Mechanism of ATP Synthesis

The ATP synthesis takes place in the F1 subunit, but the driving force is the proton flow through the FO subunit. The three β-subunits of the ATP synthase can bind ADP + Pi, form ATP from it, and release it into the mitochondrial matrix. For each of these steps, the β-subunits must be in a different conformation. The different conformations are triggered by the rotation of the γ-subunit.

- Conformations of the β-subunits
    - L-configuration ("Loose"): ADP and Pi are bound to the β-subunit.
    - T-conformation ("Tight"): ADP and Pi are converted into ATP, but are still tightly bound.
    - O-conformation ("Open"): ATP is released and ADP and Pi are bound.
- Process of ATP synthesis
    1. Initial state: The three β-subunits (F1) are present in the three different conformations.
    2. Proton flow through the channel (FO)
    3. Rotation of the γ subunit by 120° (F1)
    4. Conformational change of all three β subunits
    5. Release of ATP from the β-subunit, which switches from the T- to the O-conformation
- Calculation of the amount of ATP: For a 120° rotation - that is, for the release of one molecule of ATP - about 3-4 protons are needed.
    - During the reoxidation of NADH+H+, a total of 10 protons are pumped into the intermembrane space. The γ subunit can therefore rotate about 2.5 times, resulting in the production of approximately 2.5 molecules of ATP per molecule of NADH+H+.
    - During the reoxidation of FADH2, a total of 6 protons are pumped into the intermembrane space. The γ-subunit can therefore rotate 1.5 times, resulting in approximately 1.5 molecules of ATP generated per molecule of FADH2.

> [!NOTE]
> For each molecule of NADH+H+, 2.5 molecules of ATP are produced in the respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation; for each molecule of FADH2, 1.5 molecules of ATP are produced!

### The ATP/ADP Translocase

- Definition: Antiporter of the inner mitochondrial membrane that transports one molecule of ADP into the mitochondrial matrix and one molecule of ATP into the cytosol.
- Function: Provision of ADP for ATP synthesis
    - Inhibition (e.g. by Atractyloside) leads to the inhibition of the respiratory chain

### Regulation of the Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation

The respiratory chain depends on the availability of its substrates. The following are required:

- Reduction equivalents
- Oxygen
- ADP
- Phosphate (Pi)

> [!NOTE]
> The most important regulator is ADP. Oxidative phosphorylation can only occur in the presence of sufficient ADP. This phenomenon is referred to as "respiratory control by ADP"!

> [!NOTE]
> The electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are tightly coupled. If one is inhibited, the other cannot proceed either!

> [!NOTE] Myocardial infarction
> In the event of a myocardial infarction, at least one coronary artery becomes blocked. This leads to the muscle cells supplied by this coronary artery no longer receiving oxygen. The citric acid cycle, electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation come to a standstill. For a while, the cells can still meet their energy needs through anaerobic glycolysis; however, this can only last for a maximum of 30-60 minutes. If the blocked vessel is not reopened during this time (e.g., during a cardiac catheterization), cell necrosis occurs, eventually leading to scarring. This is why it is so important to quickly reach the nearest cardiac catheterization center when there is a justified suspicion of a heart attack!

### Decoupling and Inhibition of the Respiratory Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation

Normally, the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation occur in a coupled manner. However, certain substances or situations can lead to the uncoupling of the two pathways. There are also numerous inhibitors of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.

#### Uncouplers of the Electron Transport Chain

Uncouplers of the respiratory chain reduce the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. As a result, fewer protons flow back through the ATP synthase into the mitochondrial matrix, leading to a decrease in ATP synthesis. The electron transport chain is no longer controlled by the proton gradient and runs more intensely. Consequently, the O2 consumption of the mitochondria also increases.

- DNP (2,4-Dinitrophenol): Transports protons from the outside to the inside across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby causing a breakdown of the proton gradient.
- Thermogenin ("Uncoupling Protein" UCP-1): Proton channel that causes a breakdown of the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane.

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Electron Transport Chain
### Overview
Where are the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain anchored?
- The four protein complexes of the respiratory chain are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they build up the necessary proton gradient for ATP synthesis.
### Functioning of the Respiratory Chain

What function does Complex I of the respiratory chain serve? What is it also called?
- NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (= Complex I) transfers two electrons and two protons from NADH + H+ to ubiquinone, thereby reducing it to ubiquinol. Additionally, it pumps four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space.
What task does Complex II perform in the respiratory chain? What is it also called?
- Succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (= Complex II) transfers two electrons and two protons from FADH2 to ubiquinone, thereby reducing it to ubiquinol. It is the only complex of the respiratory chain without proton pump function; the protons are simply released back into the mitochondrial matrix.
Why does Complex II form the interface between the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain?
- Succinate dehydrogenase is both part of Complex II of the respiratory chain and an enzyme of the second phase of the citric acid cycle. In the citric acid cycle, succinate dehydrogenase oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces an FAD to FADH2. This FADH2 is then fed directly into Complex II of the respiratory chain.
What function does Complex III of the respiratory chain perform? What is the enzyme also called?
- In the so-called Q cycle, ubiquinone-cytochrome-c oxidoreductase (= Complex III) transfers two electrons from ubiquinol (QH2) to two(!) molecules of cytochrome c, which transport the electrons to Complex IV. Additionally, two protons are pumped from the matrix space into the intermembrane space, and two further protons are released from ubiquinol into the intermembrane space.
In which complex is flavin mononucleotide part of the prosthetic groups?
- Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) is a prosthetic group of Complex I. Its other prosthetic groups are iron-sulfur clusters and ubiquinone.
What function does ubiquinone have? In which complexes of the electron transport chain is it found?
- Ubiquinone accepts two electrons and two protons from Complex I or II of the respiratory chain and is thereby reduced to ubiquinol. Ubiquinol (QH2) then transfers these electrons to cytochrome c in Complex III and releases the freed protons into the intermembrane space. It is thus involved in building the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis.
How is ubiquinone structured?
- Ubiquinone (= Coenzyme Q) is a quinone with an isoprenoid side chain.
What reaction is catalyzed by superoxide dismutase?
- Superoxide dismutase converts superoxide anions into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen: 2 O2- + 2 H+ → H2O2 + O2.
### Oxidative Phosphorylation

How is the ATP synthase structured?
- ATP synthase consists of two subunits: FO and F1, both arranged in ring form. The hydrophobic FO subunit consists of three subunits; the F1 subunit consists of five subunits and has three active centers.
What do uncouplers of the respiratory chain do?
- Uncouplers of the respiratory chain dissipate the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. Because fewer protons flow back through ATP synthase into the mitochondrial matrix, ATP synthesis decreases.
Which part of the respiratory chain does cyanide (CN-) inhibit?
- Cyanide, like carbon monoxide (CO) and azide (N3-), inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV). As a result, no electrons can be transferred from the heme a3 group of cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. ATP can no longer be formed, leading to internal suffocation through a lactic acidosis.
