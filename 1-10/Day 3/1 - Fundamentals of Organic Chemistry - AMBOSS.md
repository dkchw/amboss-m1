# Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry
## Summary

The organic chemistry is one of the most important subfields of chemistry and deals with the structure, properties, and transformations of carbon compounds, which are also referred to as organic compounds. The classification into organic and inorganic dates back to a time when it was believed that living matter consisted of the elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (= organic) and everything else was inorganic matter (= inorganic). There are over 10 million of these organic substances known, compared to "only" about 100,000 inorganic ones. This diversity is based on the unique bonding pattern of carbon: Carbon atoms have four valence electrons, with which they can each form up to four nonpolar bonds with other carbon atoms. This leads to the formation of both short and long carbon chains, branched or even ring-shaped structures.

Besides carbon, organic compounds mostly contain hydrogen and oxygen, but also sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and the halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. These elements occur in so-called "functional" groups, which show very different properties and reactivity, which is why organic compounds are classified into different classes of substances according to these groups. This chapter mainly deals with the organic compounds that frequently occur in biological systems and thus also in medicine. These are primarily molecules from the classes of alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids, amines, and thiols.

## Basics of Hydrocarbons

Strictly speaking, hydrocarbons are compounds that consist solely of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). In fact, the term "hydrocarbons" also encompasses compounds that, in addition to carbon and hydrogen components, contain so-called functional groups (see: hydrocarbons with functional groups). Functional groups bind to a carbon atom in place of a hydrogen atom and thus "replace" it, so to speak. This is also where the term "substituents" for these groups is derived. Often, the term "substituent" is also applied to hydrogen atoms themselves.

Hydrocarbons form chains, rings, or combinations of both and are categorized into different groups based on their type and structure. Hydrocarbons that contain only carbon and hydrogen (e.g., alkanes) are nonpolar and thus poorly soluble in water, but well soluble in other nonpolar solvents.

## Open-chain hydrocarbons

Open-chain hydrocarbons are compounds that consist solely of carbon and hydrogen and do not form ring structures. Depending on the saturation of the C-C bonds, they are categorized into alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes.

### Alkane

Alkanes (formerly also called paraffins) are molecules made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms that have a chain-like structure and contain only single bonds. Such compounds have the maximum number of H atoms in relation to the available C atoms in the respective bonding geometry. Therefore, they are also referred to as "saturated."

- Molecular formula
    - CnH2n+2
    - Form a homologous series

#### Structure

- n-Alkane: Consist of long carbon chains (CH3 head groups and CH2 linkers), a list of the first ten n-alkanes can be found in the table below.
    - Primary C-atom: Binds only to one other C-atom (e.g., CH3 head group)
    - Secondary C-atom: Binds to two additional C-atoms (e.g. CH2 linkers)
- i-Alkane (iso-Alkane): Consist of branched carbon chains; at least four carbon atoms must be present.
    - Tertiary C-atom: Binds to three other C-atoms (e.g. branching point between three C-chain pieces)
    - Quaternary C-atom: Binds to four other C-atoms (e.g. branching point between four C chain segments)

#### Spatial Structure

For open-chain alkanes, three different spatial arrangements, known as conformers, are distinguished.

- Staggered conformation: Substituents are opposite each other → therefore have the maximum possible distance from each other.
    - Most stable form
- Ecliptic structure: Substituents are "on top of each other"
    - Most unstable possible form
- Torsional strain structure: Substituents are twisted with respect to each other → large substituents are next to each other instead of being opposite.
    - More stable than elliptical and less stable than staggered

#### Reactions

Alkanes are extremely unreactive, reacting only in the presence of strong catalysts or when they are activated by functional groups.

### Alkene

Unsaturated hydrocarbon chains that have at least one C-C double bond. The C atoms that are connected by a double bond each have two other bonding partners (since each C atom is tetravalent).

- Molecular formula: CnH2n
- Nomenclature: Corresponds to that of alkanes, but with the ending "-ene" (Ethene, Propene, Butene, etc.)
- Typical reactions: Electrophilic addition
    - E.g. bromination (both unsaturated carbon atoms each receive a bromine substituent)

Polyethylene
Through chain polymerization of alkenes, so-called polyolefins are formed, which are saturated hydrocarbons. From ethylene, the most widely used plastic in the world, polyethylene, is produced. Due to its high abrasion resistance, it is also used in medicine in implants or surfaces of endoprostheses.

### Alkine

Unsaturated hydrocarbon chains that have a C-C triple bond at least at one point.

- Molecular formula: CnH2n-2
- Nomenclature: Corresponds to that of alkanes, but with the ending "-ine" (Ethylene, Propylene, Butylene, etc.)

### Ionic Hydrocarbons

Hydrocarbons can exist as ions, which primarily play a role as intermediates in multi-step reaction processes. The ions are more reactive than comparable non-ionic molecules, meaning their stability is reduced (see also: Reactions of organic chemistry).

- Carbanion
    - Carries a negative charge on a C atom
    - The C-atom has a free electron pair and additionally forms three single bonds.
- Carbocation
    - Carries a positive charge on a C atom
    - Carbenium ion: C atom with three single bonds and therefore six bonding electrons (two per bond)
    - Carbonium Ion: C atom with five single bonds and therefore eight bonding electrons (in three bonds there are two electrons each, the remaining two bonds also have two electrons, but they are distributed over three atoms: 3×2+2=8).
    - Stabilization
        - Substitution grade: The fewer H-atoms the C-atom carries with the ionic charge, the more stable the ion is – i.e., for the stabilization of the charge at a C-atom: primary (3 H-atoms) < secondary (2 H-atoms) < tertiary (1 H-atom)
        - Conjugation (so-called resonance): Through delocalization (rearrangement) of double bonds, the charge is distributed over several carbon atoms and thus stabilized.
            - The larger the system of interconnected double bonds, the weaker the delocalized electrons bind.
                - Weakly bound electrons absorb electromagnetic radiation with lower energy and greater wavelength, which means that the number of double bonds can have an effect on the color of the molecule.
            - Charges in the α-position to a double bond (allylic position)
            - Charge in the α-position to an aromatic C6 ring (benzylic position)
        - Shielding: If the carbocation has several large substituents such that the positive charge of the molecule is inaccessible to potential reaction partners, this is referred to as a shielding effect, which also contributes to stabilization.
    - Special case of stable carbocations: Ions that are so stable that they can be isolated, i.e., "bottled," are very rare. An example of this is the trityl cation.

## Cyclic Hydrocarbons

Through intramolecular ring closure, open hydrocarbons are converted into cyclic hydrocarbons. There are both cyclic alkanes as well as alkenes and alkynes. Among the cyclic hydrocarbons, there are two particularly significant groups: aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocycles.

- Definition: Hydrocarbon compounds that consist of cyclically arranged atoms rather than chain-shaped ones.
- Nomenclature: Root name of the n-alkane with the same number of C atoms plus the prefix "Cyclo-" (Cyclopentane, Cyclohexane, Cycloheptane, etc.)

### General Structure

- Ring size
    - An alkane must have at least three carbon atoms for a ring to form.
    - C3 and C4 rings are, however, very tightly strained and therefore not particularly stable.
    - C5 and C6 rings are very stable.
    - Larger rings are then less stable again, but not tense.
- Multiple bonds: Alkenes and alkynes form less simple cyclic compounds than alkanes, as the bond angle of multiple bonds is extremely large at 180°, resulting in particularly high ring strain.

### Cyclohexane (C6H12)

A cyclic hydrocarbon with 6 carbon atoms, each forming two bonds to adjacent C atoms in the ring and two additional bonds to substituents - in the cyclohexane molecule, these are H atoms.

#### Spatial Structure

Exist in 3 different spatial structures (so-called conformations), the most stable and therefore most common conformation is the so-called chair form.

- Chair shape: One imagines the flat C6 ring and then mentally "folds" two opposite corners from the six corners of the ring, one upwards and the other downwards.
    - Most stable and common conformation
    - Substituents
        - Each C-atom in the ring is bonded to two substituents (see above).
        - To build as little tension as possible, the substituents rotate as far away from each other as they can.
        - This allows for the distinction between two spatially different types of substituents, which can, however, be interconverted by ring inversion (flipping of the ring).
            - Equatorial (eq): Refers to the substituents that lie in the same plane as the carbon atom to which they are bound.
            - Axial (ax): These are the substituents that protrude vertically upwards or downwards from the plane in which the carbon atom to which they are attached lies.
- Bathtub shape: One envisions the flat C6 ring and then mentally "folds" two opposite corners of the six corners of the ring upwards.
- Twistform: One imagines the flat C6 ring, then "grabs" two opposite corners from the six corners of the ring and twists both against each other.

### Aromatics

In cyclic molecules where conjugated double bonds occur, it can no longer be precisely stated between which of the ring-connected atoms the double bonds are localized: In the 6-membered ring, for example, these can be either the bonds C1-C2, C3-C4, C5-C6 or the bonds C2-C3, C4-C5, C6-C1. For this reason, these electrons are referred to as "delocalized." Cyclic molecules with delocalized electrons are called aromatics. They have a unique reactivity, as they are particularly stable.

- Definition (according to Hückel): Aromatics have 4n+2 delocalized electrons (i.e., 6, 10, 14, etc.)
- Properties: Inert due to delocalized electrons

#### Structure

- Ring size
    - In medicine, compounds made up of aromatic C6 rings play a role.
    - Example benzene: If a benzene ring is a part of a larger molecule, it is referred to as a phenyl group or phenyl residue.
- Spatial structure: Due to the delocalized double bonds, all aromatics are completely flat; they are also referred to as "planar" molecules.
- Ring positions
    - In aromatics, the relative position of one substituent to another is often used as a more specific indication of localization.
    - One distinguishes four relative positions.
        - ipso-Position: Position to which the substituent itself binds
        - ortho-Position: Substituent is directly adjacent to the reference point
        - meta-Position: Between the substituents and its reference point, there is still a carbon atom in the aromatic ring.
        - para-Position: Substituent and reference point are located opposite each other in the ring.

#### Representation

The delocalized electrons and the resulting equality of the bonds (all bonds are equally aromatic) are represented by a circle drawn in the aromatic ring.

### Heterocycles

Cyclic compounds, whether aromatic or not, can contain other elements besides just carbon and hydrogen. When these other atoms - called heteroatoms - are incorporated into the ring itself and not just sitting as substituents on the ring, the rings are also referred to as "heterocycles."

- Definition: Cyclic compounds in which at least one non-carbon atom is incorporated into the ring. Often, these are nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur.

### Larger Ring Systems (Organic Chemistry)

Both aromatic and non-aromatic rings can be interconnected within a molecule, leading to the formation of larger ring systems.

#### Annular Rings

- Definition: Rings in which at least one atomic bond is part of two rings simultaneously.
- Formal formation: Through condensation (= fusion) of several (hetero‑)cyclic compounds
- Examples
    - Aromatic, annulated rings: e.g. naphthalene
    - Non-aromatic, annelated rings: e.g. Sterane
    - Heterocyclic, fused rings: e.g. Indole
- Properties
    - The electrons of aromatic, fused rings are delocalized across the entire ring system.
    - Anellation prevents rotation around the axis of the single bond belonging to both rings in non-aromatic rings, allowing for the formation of cis/trans isomers.

#### Bridged Rings

- Definition: A system in which at least two atoms of a ring are simultaneously part of another ring in the molecule.
- Formal formation: By binding both ends of an open-chain hydrocarbon to C-atoms of a cyclic hydrocarbon.
- Example molecule: Adamantane (structural unit of diamond), Norbornene
- Properties
    - The carbon atoms that belong to two or three rings simultaneously are called "bridgehead atoms."
    - Bridgehead atoms can be stereocenters if both rings are not symmetrically substituted.
    - Two bridged rings can be fully saturated or contain multiple bonds, but they cannot both be aromatic!

#### Spiro compounds

- Definition: Cyclic compounds in which two rings share one atom.
- Formal formation: Through condensation (= fusion) of several (hetero-)cyclic compounds at an atom
- Example molecule: Spironolactone (= Aldosterone antagonist)
- Properties
    - The atom that belongs to both ring systems is called a spiro atom.
    - Spiroatoms can be C-atoms or heteroatoms (e.g., N-atoms)
    - Substituted spiro compounds can also be chiral when both rings are the same (see: axial chirality)

## Functional Groups - Overview

Functional groups are atom groups that replace hydrogen atoms in hydrocarbons and significantly influence the reactivity of the compound they are part of. Due to their similar properties, hydrocarbons are classified into different substance classes based on their functional groups.

### Rules for Naming Hydrocarbons with Functional Groups

Hydrocarbons are named according to their chemical structure as follows:

1. One searches for the longest carbon chain in the molecule; the name of the underlying alkane is used as the root name of the compound (e.g., Meth-, Eth-, Prop-, But-, etc.).
2. Attached to this chain are additional hydrocarbon chains (branches) and/or functional groups that are included in the name.
    - Where in the longest chain is the branching/functional group located: It is indicated by the number of the C-atom in the longest C-chain.
        - To do this, the longest carbon chain of the molecule is numbered. The starting point is chosen as the end of the carbon chain that is closest to the side chains and functional groups, so that these can carry the smallest possible numbers.
        - Special case: Terminal functional groups
            - Naming the C atoms in the longest chain with Greek letters, starting with the C atom next to the C atom that carries the functional group
    - What is attached as a branching/functional group to the carbon chain: Naming of the "substituents"
        - C-side chains: Are named according to their length with the base name of the underlying hydrocarbon and receive the suffix -yl.
        - Functional groups: They receive the name that is typical for them (see table above)
            - If there is more than one functional group in the molecule, the group with the highest priority (see table above) is attached as a suffix, while all others are placed in front as prefixes.
    - In what order are branches/functional groups named: The name is NOT composed based on the increasing C-atom number of the substituents, but rather sorted alphabetically.
3. Finally, the name of the molecule is assembled. The base name of the longest carbon chain forms the end of the name, preceded (in alphabetical order) by all the names of side chains/functional groups, each of which is prefixed by the number of the carbon atom of the longest chain to which they are bound.

## Alcohols

The functional group of the class of compounds known as alcohols is the hydroxyl group (OH group). Alcohols are formed by the substitution of at least one hydrogen atom with a hydroxyl group. If we are dealing with aromatic alcohols, they are also referred to as phenols. They are formed when at least one hydrogen atom of an aromatic compound is replaced by a hydroxyl group.

### Alcohols

- Origin:
    - By oxidizing a carbon atom in a hydrocarbon
    - By hydration, i.e., the addition of a water molecule to the double bond of alkenes
- Nomenclature: Name of the organic backbone + suffix "-ol" (Butane → Butanol)

#### Classification

- By valency: Depending on the number of hydroxyl groups, one distinguishes between monovalent and multivalent forms.
    - For example, ethanol is a monovalent alcohol, glycerol is a trivalent alcohol.
- By substitution degree: i.e. according to the number of C atoms that are adjacent to the C atom bearing the hydroxyl group.
    - Primary alcohol: One more carbon atom
        - Special case: Methanol is also a primary alcohol, but has only one C-atom in total.
    - Secondary alcohol: Two additional C atoms
    - Tertiary alcohol: three additional carbon atoms

#### Characteristics

- Better soluble in water than alkanes
- Higher boiling point

#### Typical Reactions

- Dehydration: In the presence of strong acids, alcohols can be dehydrated to alkenes, ethers, or esters.
    - Ether: Formed when two alcohol molecules react in the presence of strong acids with the elimination of water; a molecule is produced in which an oxygen atom carries two alkyl groups.
        - Nomenclature: According to the type of alkyl groups that carry the ether group
        - Properties: Boiling point lower than that of alcohols
    - Esters: Formed mainly in the presence of polyprotic acids; here, an alcohol combines with an acid with the elimination of water.
    - Alkene: Formed from alcohols (tertiary > secondary > primary) through dehydration (i.e., removal of water) in acid
- Oxidation: Alcohols can be oxidized with suitable oxidizing agents (in medicine by enzymes).
    - The oxidation of primary alcohols produces aldehydes.
        - Oxidation of secondary alcohols produces ketones.
- Acid-base reaction: Acidity like water

> [!note]
> Ethers and esters should not be confused with each other. Although both are produced acid-catalyzed from alcohols, ethers are formed from a reaction between two alcohols, whereas esters are produced from a reaction between an alcohol and an acid!

### Phenol

- Classification: By Valency - Depending on the number of hydroxyl groups, one distinguishes between univalent and multivalent forms.
- Properties: Crystalline, boiling point increases with the number of hydroxyl groups

#### Typical Reactions

- Oxidation: Through the oxidation of certain phenols with a hydroxyl group in the ortho or para position relative to the hydroxyl group, quinones are formed.
- Acid-base reaction: Azides as alcohols, thus donate protons in the presence of strong bases.
- Substitution: The hydroxyl group facilitates the substitution of additional hydrogen atoms with other atoms/functional groups.

## Aldehydes and Ketones

The functional group of aldehydes and ketones is the carbonyl group (C=O). They differ in the position of the carbonyl group in the molecule.

### Aldehyde

- Definition: Hydrocarbon with a terminal carbonyl group ("aldehyde group")
- Origin: By oxidation of primary alcohols
- Nomenclature: Name of the organic backbone + suffix "-al" (Butane → Butanal)

### Ketone

- Definition: Hydrocarbon with a non-terminal carbonyl group ("ketone group")
- Origin: By oxidation of secondary alcohols
- Nomenclature: Name of the organic backbone + suffix "-one" (Butane → Butanone) or prefix "Oxo-" or "Keto-" (e.g., 2-Oxoglutarate)

### Typical Reactions of Carbonyls

Since the chemical structure and properties of aldehydes and ketones are similar, their typical reactions are also similar. The carbonyl group is polarized due to the differing electronegativity of its components: the more electronegative oxygen atom pulls the electron cloud slightly more towards itself and is therefore slightly negatively charged. In contrast, the more electropositive carbon atom carries a slight positive charge. This can also be represented in the notation as resonance structures of these compounds, which show the limiting cases of charge distribution. For the reactivity of the components of the carbonyl group, this means that the oxygen atom reacts with electrophilic compounds, while the carbon atom reacts with nucleophilic compounds.

- Oxidation
    - Aldehydes are oxidized to carboxylic acids.
    - Ketones cannot be oxidized further.
- Aldol formation (only aldehydes)
    - Aldoles are molecules that have an aldehyde function in proximity to an alcohol function.
    - They are formed by the reaction of two aldehydes with each other.
- Halbacetal and Acetal Formation
    - Hemiacetal: Functional group R–CH–(OR)(OH), Hemiketal: Functional group R–CR–(OR)(OH)
        - Formation through the reaction of an alcohol with the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone
    - Acetal or Ketal: Functional group R-C(OR)2-R
        - Formation through the reaction of a hemiacetal with another alcohol
    - Cyclic hemiacetals: Form when carbonyl and hydroxyl groups react with each other within the same molecule.
- Schiff base reaction
    - By the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with a primary amine, imines of the form R-N=CR2 are formed with the elimination of water, which are also known as Schiff bases.
- Keto-Enol Tautomerism
    - Carbonyls, especially ketones, can rearrange into alcohols with a double bond in the carbon chain.
    - Such alcohols are referred to as enols according to the nomenclature.
    - In aqueous solution, both forms are stable, meaning they coexist and continuously convert into each other; such an equilibrium is also referred to as "tautomerism."
    - Stark simplified process: A proton from the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl group is transferred to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group, after which the C=O double bond rearranges and becomes a C=C double bond.
        - Deprotonation at the adjacent carbon atom: Strong bases remove a proton from the carbon atom that is adjacent to the carbonyl group.
        - Reprotonation: When the solution is acidified, a proton can now attach either to the carbon atom (resulting in the keto form with the C=O double bond) or to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group (resulting in the enol form with the C=C double bond).

> [!note]
> Another oxidation of non-terminal carbonyl groups is not possible!

## Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives

The functional group of carboxylic acids is the carboxyl group (COOH group). Carboxylic acids play a significant role in biochemical processes and are widely found in nature.

### Carboxylic Acids

- Formation: Through oxidation of aldehydes
- Nomenclature: Name of the organic backbone + suffix "-acid" (for alkanes, e.g. methanoic acid, ethanoic acid, etc.)

#### Classification

- By the number of carboxyl groups (Monocarboxylic acids = one carboxyl group, dicarboxylic acids = two carboxyl groups, tricarboxylic acids = three carboxyl groups)
- After further functional groups (hydroxy, keto, amino acids)
    - For example, α-amino acids: Additionally contains an amino group at the α-C atom.
- Longer-chain carboxylic acids (from four carbon atoms) are also referred to as "fatty acids."

#### Typical Reactions

- Acid-base reaction: Carboxylic acids are very acidic, meaning they donate protons in aqueous solution.
    - Di- and tricarboxylic acids, like all polyprotic acids, have multiple pKa values.
- Dehydration: At higher temperatures, carboxylic acids form carboxylic anhydrides from one another (with the elimination of water).
- Decarboxylation: Removal of the COOH group from a carboxylic acid

> [!note]
> The OH group of the carboxylic acid is not a hydroxyl group, but rather a component of the carboxyl group, and thus has fundamentally different properties!

### Derivatives of Carboxylic Acids

Carboxylic acid derivatives are organic compounds whose functional group is derived from a carboxyl group. They differ in their properties and reactivity from carboxylic acids.

#### Esther

- Definition: Connections that contain the functional group R-COOR'.
- Ester formation: Esters are formed by the elimination of water from alcohols and carboxylic acids (Alcohol + Carboxylic acid ⇄ Ester + H2O)
    - Molecules with an alcohol group and an acid group (e.g., lactic acid) can therefore form polyesters.
- Ester hydrolysis: In the cleavage of ester bonds, two forms are distinguished.
    1. Acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis: reverse reaction of ester formation, reversible
    2. Base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis (saponification): Hydrolysis of an ester by the aqueous solution of a hydroxide (e.g. sodium hydroxide), irreversible
        - Product: The alcohol and the carboxylate ion (salt of the carboxylic acid) from which the ester was formed

> [!note]
> The acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis is reversible, while the base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis (saponification) is irreversible!

##### Esters of Inorganic Acids

#### Carboxylic Acid Anhydride

- Definition: Carboxylic acid anhydrides are acids that are formed through the OH group of the COOH group by the elimination of water and possess a functional RCOOOCR group.

Thiols are the sulfur analogs of alcohols; their functional group is the thiol group (-SH).

- Nomenclature: Name of the organic backbone + prefix "Sulfanyl-" (obsolete: "Mercapto-") or suffix "-thiol"
- Properties: They do not form hydrogen bonds, therefore their boiling point is lower than that of the corresponding alcohols.
- Typical reactions
    - Oxidation
        - In contrast to alcohols, thiols are oxidized at the sulfur atom rather than at the carbon atom.
        - The product varies depending on the strength of the oxidizing agent.
            - Sulfonic acids
                - Through oxidation with strong oxidizing agents, thiols are converted into sulfonic acids of the general form R-S(=O)2-OH
                - Amides of sulfonic acids of the general form R-S(=O)2-NR2 (sulfonamide amides) play an important role in pharmacology, e.g. as antibiotics or antidiabetics.

## Stereochemistry and Isomerism

From the structure and geometry of molecules, structural relationships of molecules with the same molecular formula can be derived, which is particularly helpful when molecules are very large and contain multiple functional groups. For this purpose, the concept of isomerism is used. However, to understand all forms of isomerism, one must first deal with the concept of chirality: even if one often does not think about it, all molecules still have a three-dimensional structure. This leads to the fact that molecules which appear identical at first glance as a two-dimensional drawing on paper are, in reality, not identical, but behave like a picture and its mirror image. Such molecules are called enantiomers or "chiral," derived from the Greek word chiros = "handedness" (since a left and a right hand also behave like a picture and its mirror image).

## Chirality

- Chirality: Spatial asymmetry of molecules that is concentrated either at a point (the so-called chirality center) or along an axis (axial chirality)
- Chiral center (also stereocenter): C-atoms to which four different substituents are attached.
    - For each of these stereocenters, there are two spatial arrangement possibilities that behave like a picture and its mirror image and cannot be superimposed.
    - For molecules that have more than one stereocenter (number of stereocenters = n), there are consequently 2n three-dimensional shapes of the molecule.
- Significance in biochemistry: Many biochemically relevant molecules are chiral, e.g. amino acids and thus also proteins.

Effect of different enantiomers (e.g., thalidomide embryopathy)
The physiological properties of enantiomers are usually completely different! For example, (+)-limonene smells like orange, while (‑)-limonene smells like turpentine. Chirality is particularly important for medicine with regard to the pharmacological effect of molecules: only (+)-ibuprofen is effective, whereas (‑)-ibuprofen is ineffective and must first be converted into the (+)-form in the body. Often, side effects of medications are also attributed to only one of the two enantiomers. The most well-known example of this is Contergan, whose active ingredient thalidomide acts as a sedative in the (+)-form and is harmful to the fetus in the (‑)-form. Since (+)-thalidomide is partially converted into (‑)-thalidomide in the body, medication with pure (+)-thalidomide is also not without side effects.

### Prochirality

"Prochiral" refers to molecules that can become chiral through the addition of a new substituent or by substituting an already existing substituent. Prochiral centers in molecules are planar (addition variant) or already tetrahedral (substitution variant). Examples of planar, prochiral molecules include carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and ketones.

- Example: Butanone is an asymmetric molecule and is reduced to the alcohol butanol. The carbon atom that bonds to the alcohol function (OH group) after reduction then carries four different substituents and is thus chiral.

### Nomenclature of Enantiomers

For dealing with chiral compounds, it is important to be able to clearly identify which enantiomer it is. There are various nomenclatures for this purpose, which also find their application in the medical context.

#### Classification of Enantiomers by Their Physical Properties

Due to the great similarity of enantiomers, many of their chemical and physical properties (such as boiling point, melting point, density) are the same. A significant difference lies in optical activity: When a polarized beam of light passes through a sample of a pure enantiomer, all molecules affect the light in the same way. The oscillation of the light beam is altered or "rotated" in one direction.

- (+)-Enantiomer: Rotates polarized light clockwise (to the right)
- (‑)-Enantiomer: Rotates polarized light counterclockwise (to the left).
- Racemat: A mixture of both enantiomers that does not rotate polarized light.

#### R/S Nomenclature

The official designation of enantiomers is done according to the so-called R/S nomenclature. Here, the direction of polarized light does not play a role, as in the (+) or (‑) form (see above), but rather the geometry of the stereocenter.

To determine whether an enantiomer has the R or S form, the following steps are taken:

1. One looks for a stereocenter of the molecule, for example, a carbon atom with four different substituents.
2. Man numbers all substituents at this center according to their priority.
    - To determine the priority, there are a few general rules: The priority increases with increasing atomic number (or mass number in the case of isotopes) and/or with increasing chain branching at the nearest binding atom of the substituent.
    - In cases where two substituents are bonded to the chiral center with the same atoms, the next atom in the substituent group's chain is examined. If this is also the same (for example, both are C atoms again), then the atom adjacent to this atom is considered, and so on, until the first difference between the two substituents is found.
3. One now imagines that the part with the lowest priority protrudes backward from the plane of the paper (often marked in structural formulas by a dashed bond), another protrudes forward from the plane of the paper (often marked in structural formulas by a wedge-shaped, bold bond), and all other parts lie in the plane of the paper (often marked in structural formulas by a normal line).
4. In the molecule that has been rotated in this way, one mentally connects the substituents in the plane of the paper, starting with the substituent of highest priority, then the one with second highest priority, and then the one with third highest priority. If one moves clockwise around the stereocenter, it is the R-enantiomer. If one moves counterclockwise around the stereocenter, it is the S-enantiomer.

#### D/L-Nomenclature

In biochemistry, the D/L nomenclature is used for the enantiomers of carbohydrates and amino acids instead of the R/S nomenclature.

- Approach to carbohydrates
    - The molecule is drawn in the Fischer projection.
    - The chiral carbon atom that is farthest from the carbonyl group is being considered.
    - If the OH group at this carbon atom points to the right, the D-form is present; if it points to the left, the L-form is present.
- Procedure for amino acids: Similar, however, the position of the amino group at the α-C-atom is considered.

## Isomerism

The more atoms a molecule has, the more possibilities there are to link them together. Even with relatively small molecules, the molecular formula is no longer a definitive indication of what type of molecule is present. Molecules with the same molecular formula but different structures are called isomers. There are different types of isomers:

### Constitutional Isomers

Molecules with the same molecular formula and different arrangements of how the atoms are connected, e.g. n-butane and i-butane, dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde, or fructose-6-phosphate and galactose-1-phosphate.

### Stereoisomers

Molecules with the same molecular formula and the same constitution (atom sequence), but different spatial arrangement (configuration or conformation).

#### Conformational Isomers

Stereoisomers that can be interconverted by rotation around a C-C single bond, such as cyclohexane in chair form and in boat form.

#### Configurational Isomers

Stereoisomers that cannot be converted into each other by rotation around a C-C single bond, either because the rotation of the bond is lost (double bonds and bridging bonds) or because the compound is chiral.

- Cis/trans isomers: Molecules with double bonds or bridgehead atoms that can no longer rotate freely around the bond axis have a fixed spatial relationship between the substituents.
    - cis-Isomer (also Z-isomer): Refers to the bonding partners on the same side of the bond.
    - trans-Isomer (also E-Isomer): Refers to the bonding partners being on different sides of the bond.
- Enantiomer
    - Have opposite chirality at all existing chirality centers
    - The entire molecule behaves like a mirror image (e.g., D-Glucose and L-Glucose)
- Diastereomers: Configuration isomers that are not enantiomers (e.g., L-Glucose and D-Galactose)
    - The molecules do not behave like an image and its reflection.
    - Epimer (Chemistry)
        - Have multiple chiral centers, but only one has opposite chirality (e.g. D-Glucose and D-Galactose)

## Review Questions on the Chapter Basics of Organic Chemistry
### Basics of Hydrocarbons

What polarity do unsubstituted hydrocarbons have?
- Unsubstituted hydrocarbons are nonpolar.

### Open-chain hydrocarbons

What is meant by a quaternary carbon atom?
- Carbon atoms are distinguished (due to neighboring group effects, which allow the reactivity of a C atom to be well estimated) according to the number of their non-H atom bonding partners: Quaternary C atoms have four of these neighbors and thus no bond to a H atom. Tertiary C atoms, on the other hand, have three such neighbors and bind to one H atom. Secondary C atoms bind to two non-H atom neighbors and two H atoms. Primary C atoms are finally terminal C atoms that have only one non-H atom neighbor and thus bind to three H atoms.

Which conformation (= geometry) is the most stable in open-chain hydrocarbons?
- In the most stable conformation of a molecule, all atoms stay as far apart as possible, thereby having minimal steric interactions. This leads to neighboring substituents being on opposite sides of a bond. This is called staggered conformation.

To which type of reaction does the bromination of alkenes belong?
- In the bromination of an alkene, an electron-loving (= electrophilic) particle, here Br2, adds in the first step to the electron-rich double bond of the alkene. This type of reaction is therefore called "electrophilic addition."

What influence do substituents have on the stability of carbocations?
- Carbocations are stabilized by substituents if these are not themselves positively charged or polarized. As a rule of thumb, one can say: The fewer H atoms the C atom bearing the ionic charge carries, the more stable it is.

### Cyclic Hydrocarbons

What is a ring inversion?
- A ring inversion is when a non-aromatic ring "turns inside out," sometimes also called a "ring flip." The ring inversion occurs because the C-C single bonds in the ring are freely rotatable. This rotational movement is only relevant because in non-aromatic rings there are distinguishable positions of substituents on the ring, a so-called equatorial and an axial position. These positions are swapped during the ring inversion.

What part of a molecule is called the phenyl group?
- A phenyl group (also phenyl residue) is a benzene ring that is directly attached as a substituent to the main part of a larger molecule.

What geometry is characteristic of aromatics?
- Aromatics are planar molecules. This is because the electrons of the double bonds in aromatics are conjugated. For this, these orbitals must overlap, which can only be ensured if the atoms lie in one plane.

Which heterocycles are part of cytochrome C, histidine, omeprazole, and NAD, tryptophan, and adenine, and what do they look like?
- The heterocycle in cytochrome C is the so-called pyrrole, a 5-membered ring with one N atom and two double bonds. The heterocycle in histidine is the so-called imidazole, a 5-membered ring with two N atoms and two double bonds. The heterocycle present in molecules like omeprazole or NAD is called pyridine. Pyridine is a benzene ring in which one C atom has been replaced by an N atom. The heterocycle in the side chain of the amino acid tryptophan is the so-called indole (a benzene ring fused with a pyrrole ring). The nucleobase adenine contains the so-called purine heterocycle. This consists of two aromatic fused rings, a 5-membered and a 6-membered ring, both rings having two N atoms each.

### Alcohols

What is an alcohol and how do primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols differ?
- Alcohols are molecules that contain one or more OH groups. The subdivision into "primary," "secondary," and "tertiary" refers to how many non-H atom substituents bind to the C atom bearing the OH group.

### Aldehydes and Ketones

What is an aldol and how is it formed?
- An aldol is a molecule that has an aldehyde group and an adjacent alcohol group – hence the name "ald-ol." Aldols form when two aldehydes react with each other.

How do hemiacetals and acetals differ from each other?
- A hemiacetal is a molecule where an alcohol group, an ether group, one H atom, and any hydrocarbon residue bind simultaneously to a C atom. In an acetal, instead of the alcohol group, a second ether group binds. Hemiacetals form when an aldehyde reacts with an alcohol; acetals form when this hemiacetal reacts with another alcohol molecule.

What is a Schiff base reaction?
- In a Schiff base reaction, a so-called Schiff base is formed, an imine molecule with the functional group R'-N=CR₂. For this, an aldehyde or ketone must combine with an amine under water elimination (condensation reaction).

What is meant by the term "keto-enol tautomerism"?
- Tautomerism is an equilibrium between two molecules that continuously convert into each other. In keto-enol tautomerism, a ketone converts into its enol form and vice versa. During this, the double bond of the ketone (C=O) shifts between the carbonyl C atom and the α-C atom (C=C), whereby the O atom becomes an alcohol function. The "en-ol" is thus a molecule with an alcohol group and a directly adjacent alkene group.

### Carboxylic Acids and Their Derivatives

How are carboxylic acids with two carboxyl groups called?
- Carboxylic acids with two acid functions (= carboxyl groups, -COOH) are called dicarboxylic acids.

What is a carboxylic acid anhydride?
- A carboxylic acid anhydride is the condensation product of two carboxylic acids, formed when two carboxylic acids react with each other, releasing one water molecule.

What happens during a decarboxylation reaction?
- Decarboxylation is a reaction in which a carboxylic acid splits off the deprotonated carboxyl group (-COOH) as CO2.

Formate is the anion of which carboxylic acid?
- Formate is the anion of methanoic acid, whose trivial name is "formic acid." The name "formate" is derived from the Latin word "formica" for ant.

Which carboxylic acids are usually referred to by the trivial names "oxalic acid," "succinic acid," and "fumaric acid"?
- Oxalic acid is ethanedioic acid. Succinic acid is butanedioic acid. Fumaric acid is the trivial name of trans-butenedioic acid.

What do a carboxylic acid ester and a phosphoric acid ester have in common, and how do they differ?
- Acid esters are condensation products of an acid and an alcohol. In a carboxylic acid ester, the acid part of the ester is a carboxylic acid; in a phosphoric acid ester, it is phosphoric acid (H3PO4).

What is a lactone and how is it formed?
- A lactone is a cyclic ester of any ring size. The medically most important lactones, however, are 6-membered rings.

What are carboxylic acid amides?
- Carboxylic acid amides are condensation products of carboxylic acids and amines. They have the functional group -CONR₂.

What property of carboxylic acid amides results from their resonance structure?
- In carboxylic acid amides, similar to carboxylic acids, the double bond of the functional group is delocalized; it is equally distributed over the CO and CN bond. Therefore, carboxylic acid amides are virtually non-basic – unlike amines, which generally react basic due to their lone electron pairs.

What are the sulfur analogs of carboxylic acid esters called?
- The sulfur analogs of carboxylic acid esters are called thioesters.

### Thiole

What is a sulfonic acid and how is it formed?
- Sulfonic acids are molecules with the functional group R-S(=O)₂-OH. They form when thiols react with strong oxidizing agents.

### Chirality

What is a chiral center and what is another name for it?
- C atoms with four different substituents are called "chiral centers." These C atoms are also called stereocenters.

Explain the concept of prochirality.
- Molecules that are not themselves chiral but can become chiral molecules by a simple substitution or addition reaction are called "prochiral." Depending on from which side the new substituent approaches the prochiral molecule, molecules with different chirality and thus different enantiomers are formed.

What is a racemate?
- A racemate is a 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers. The remarkable property of racemates is that they appear not to be optically active because the opposite rotation effects of the two enantiomers cancel each other out.

When determining the R/S nomenclature of a chiral molecule, the priority of the different substituents at the chiral center must be established. What is this based on?
- To determine the priorities of the substituents at a chiral center, first, the atoms directly attached to the chiral C atom must be considered. Their priority is based on the atomic number of the atoms in the periodic table: the higher the atomic number, the higher the priority. If two or more of these atoms are identical, the priorities of the next atoms bonded are compared. One moves away slowly from the chiral center until the first atom is found where the substituents are no longer identical, and there the priority is determined according to the atomic numbers of these atoms.

### Isomerism

What are isomers?
- Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different structural formulas.

What types of isomers are there and how do they differ from each other?
- Isomers are molecules with the same molecular formula but different molecular structures. The structures of constitutional isomers are the least similar. These are molecules where not even the order of the bonded atoms is identical. If isomers have the same atom order but a different spatial arrangement (configuration), they are stereoisomers. These are further divided into conformational isomers and configurational isomers. Conformational isomers are molecules that can be converted into each other by rotation about a single bond. Configurational isomers are divided into three subtypes: cis/trans isomers, enantiomers, and diastereomers. Configurational isomers with a double bond are called cis/trans isomers, where substituents of higher priority are either on the same or different sides of the double bond. Configurational isomers with only one stereocenter are called enantiomers if they behave like image and mirror image, or diastereomers if they do not.

Choose three arbitrary organic molecules from a chemistry book and name all the functional groups of the molecule. See: Functional groups.
