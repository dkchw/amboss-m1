# Fundamentals of Scientific Studies
## Summary

Medicine is a practice-oriented discipline that derives much of its knowledge from application itself (trial-and-error approach). This state of information is supported by medical (and psychological) research through scientific studies, the methodological foundations of which are presented here. An important starting point for a meaningful study is the appropriate research question or a testable hypothesis. Additionally, it is necessary to determine what should be measured as a representative for the often not directly quantifiable characteristic (such as “depression”) (so-called indicators). The correct study design ensures that as few confounding effects as possible distort the results, and the choice of sample plays a significant role in this regard. In the end, there is the evaluation of the obtained data and the comparison with results from other studies.
## Hypothesis Formation

Before conducting a scientific study, a hypothesis is established. It is an assumption about the relationship between the variable being studied and the outcome of the study. Whether this hypothesis is true will then be scientifically investigated through the study. Sufficiently tested and validated hypotheses lead to the formation of theories.

### Hypothesis and Theory

If there is sufficient evidence and no refutations, a hypothesis can become a theory. The terms induction and deduction describe how one can arrive at a hypothesis.

- Deduction
    - Conclusion from a general statement to a specific case
    - Example: A doctor knows that a medication can cause nausea and concludes that his patient's nausea comes from that medication.
- Induction:
    - Conclusion from a single case to a general statement
    - Example: A doctor notices that some patients feel nauseous from a medication, and concludes that the medication generally causes nausea as a side effect.
- Falsifiability
    - A statement that can be refuted is called falsifiable.
    - A scientific hypothesis/theory must be falsifiable.
    - Principle of Falsification: Scientific progress is based on the refutation of incorrect statements. The principle of falsification originates from the epistemologist Karl Popper.

### Causality in Medicine

One way to arrive at a hypothesis is through a suspected causality. Through observations, one might come to the idea that a certain exposure leads to a disease. To assess such a causality hypothesis, the nine causality criteria according to Bradford-Hill are widely used in medicine.

> [!NOTE]
> The criteria are not prerequisites for causality; they are meant to assist in critical assessment.

- Bradford-Hill Criteria: Critical evaluation of a possible causal relationship in medicine
    - Effect size: A strong, statistically significant effect makes a connection more likely (but a small effect does not exclude it).
    - Reproducibility: A connection that is noticeable under different conditions
    - Specificity: A specific cause leads to a specific effect.
    - Temporal context: The exposure must precede the suspected consequence.
    - Dose dependency: Greater exposure shows a stronger effect.
    - Biological plausibility: The effect can be explained by a biological mechanism.
    - Coherence: The correlation is consistent with other findings regarding the disease (e.g., laboratory tests, other epidemiological anomalies).
    - Experimental verification: The causal relationship is demonstrated in experiments (e.g., animal experiments, in the laboratory, through interventions).
    - Analogy: There are similar relationships for which causality is known.

### Types of Hypotheses

One distinguishes between different types of hypotheses, of which a selection will be presented below.

#### Deterministic and Probabilistic Hypotheses

This distinction refers to the validity or the probability of occurrence of tested hypotheses.

- Deterministic Hypothesis
    - A connection between factors exists with one hundred percent certainty.
    - Rarely encountered in medicine and psychology, but rather in fields such as physics and mathematics.
- Probabilistic Hypothesis
    - Predicts a likely correlation of factors
    - Is most commonly used in medicine and psychology
        - Example: The occurrence of a disease in the presence of certain risk factors

#### Null and Alternative Hypothesis

One can never prove the validity of a statement/hypothesis for all people at all times in empirical science. Thus, the validity of a hypothesis can only be proven indirectly by excluding false hypotheses (= falsification principle). This principle is reflected in the formulation of null and alternative hypotheses, which are tested against each other in the context of hypothesis testing.

- Null hypothesis HO: X = Y ("There is no difference between the groups.")
- Alternative Hypothesis H1: X ≠ Y ("There is a difference between the groups.")

If there is a difference between the groups, this disproves the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis can initially be assumed.

##### Error of the 1st and 2nd Kind

In medicine, a statement cannot generally be proven with certainty; there is always a certain likelihood of arriving at an incorrect result. One distinguishes between Type I and Type II errors:

- Type I Error (α-error): Null hypothesis is rejected even though it is actually true.
- Type II Error (β-error): Null hypothesis is retained, although in reality the alternative hypothesis is true.

##### Multiple Tests

When multiple tests are conducted in succession, this has implications for the probability of error. It should therefore always be carefully considered which tests are sensible.

- α-error accumulation: The probability of α-error increases with the number of tests conducted.
    - Can be adjusted by altering the significance level (e.g. using the Bonferroni method).
## Investigation Planning

### Intervention Studies

The intervention is a treatment measure whose effect is to be measured in a study. For this purpose, the baseline values before the intervention are measured (pre-time point) and compared with the values after the intervention (post-time point). At the same time, it should be excluded that the change is attributable to other factors. The randomized controlled trial is the study design with the highest validity. In contrast, if no intervention is conducted but only a natural and real situation is observed, it is referred to as a non-experimental study.

- Randomized controlled trial: To assess whether the study result is indeed due to the intervention and not other factors, the following measures are taken before the start of the study:
    - Division of participants into groups
        - Experimental group (EG): Group undergoing an intervention (Example: Receives medication)
        - Control group (CG): Group that undergoes no intervention (Example: Receives placebo)
    - Randomization
        - The distribution into EG and KG is done randomly.
        - This excludes the possibility that the groups differ in ways that could distort the result.
        - Reduces a priori (i.e., before conducting the study) possible personal influences on the outcome
    - Intention-to-treat principle: All patients who were assigned to groups through randomization should be included in the analysis, including those who did not complete the experiment.
- Quasi-Experiment
    - The division into groups does not occur randomly.
    - Lower validity than the randomized controlled study
    - Used when differences between naturally occurring groups are to be examined.

#### Example: Randomized controlled study on back pain

- Research Question: Does a movement program have a positive effect on back pain?
- Participants: 60
    - Computer-assisted randomization using random numbers → 30 participants in the experimental group (EG) and 30 in the control group (CG)
        - This is a randomized study.
    - EG: Receives intervention (exercise program)
    - KG: Does not receive any intervention
        - This is a randomized controlled trial
- Alternative Hypothesis: The exercise program reduces back pain
- Null hypothesis: The exercise program has no effect; any changes in back pain are random.
- Data collection: After eight weeks of recording changes in back pain (e.g., using a questionnaire with a rating scale)
- Evaluation: About statistical tests

##### Characteristics of a Rating Scale

- Use for capturing subjective assessments of, for example, pain
- Construction
    - Numerical Rating Scale: Assessment based on numerical values
    - Symbolic rating scale: Evaluation based on symbols
    - Verbal Rating Scale: Assessment based on a descriptive text
- Rating scales allow for the formation of a ranking (index formation) and thus have at least the level of an ordinal scale
- Rating scales that range from one extreme through a neutral value to another extreme are referred to as a Likert scale.

### Errors in Studies

Systematic errors in studies can distort the research results by shifting them in a certain direction (reduced validity). To counteract these errors, one applies single or double blinding and randomization.

- Systematic errors
    - Hawthorne Effect (Subject error):
        - By consciously participating in a study, the participants change their behavior and thus influence the outcome.
        - Countermeasure → Simple binding: To contain the effect, the participants do not know whether they belong to the experimental group or the control group.
    - Rosenthal Effect (Experimenter Bias):
        - Due to the expectations of the experimenter, they behave differently towards the participants of the study and thus influence the outcome.
        - Countermeasure → Double-blind: To reduce this effect, neither the patient nor the doctor knows the patient's group affiliation.
- Random errors
    - Due to inaccuracies in the study execution, the result of a study randomly deviates from the true effect in the population.
    - Result in a test under the same conditions yielding different results with multiple measurements (reduced reliability)
    - Extensive sample sizes and reliable measurement instruments counteract random errors.

> [!NOTE]
> The randomized controlled trial is the study type with the highest methodological quality!

### Types of Epidemiological Studies

Epidemiological data can be obtained in various ways. Prospective studies are more meaningful, but also significantly more demanding.

- Primary data: Data that is collected directly for a specific question.
- Secondary data: Data that is not collected directly but is obtained from primary data by re-evaluating it at a later time with a different research question.
    - Example: Data originally collected to assess the care situation of chronically ill patients will be re-analyzed to identify risk factors for specific diseases.

|Study Type|Design|Advantages|Disadvantages|Example|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cross-sectional study|- At a single point in time, one or more groups are examined for a characteristic|- Low effort<br>- Initial orientation|- Confounding<br>- Purely descriptive|- Prevalence measurement of a disease|
|Prospective Longitudinal Study|- Prospective = looking ahead<br>- One or more groups (cohorts) are examined now and at a later time|- Developmental trajectories can be captured|- High time and financial expenditure|- Two groups (exposed/non-exposed to risk factors) are compared now and at a later time regarding the risk of disease|
|Case-Control Study|- Retrospective<br>- A case group and a control group are examined for past factors|- Initial orientation|- High susceptibility to error<br>- Low validity<br>- Selection bias: The choice of the control group can alter the results<br>- Recall bias: Distorted memories and the reevaluation of the past can skew the results|- One group of patients is compared with a group of healthy individuals regarding past exposure to a risk factor|
|Single-Group Pre-Post Study (Before-After Study)|- Prospective<br>- A characteristic is compared in a single group before and after an intervention|- Low effort<br>- Initial indications of possible effects of an intervention|- Low validity<br>    - Changes in characteristics may also occur independently of the intervention|- In a group of patients, the course of the disease is observed after an intervention|

### Samples

- Sample: A subset to be examined, through which one aims to infer properties of the population
- Representativeness: Indicates whether a subset is similar in relevant characteristics to a larger set.
    - From high representativeness, it follows that characteristics of the sample are likely transferable to the population.
- Before conducting scientific studies, a so-called sample size calculation is used to estimate how large the sample should be at a minimum.
    - For the calculation of the sample size, the α-error risk is usually set at 5% and the power (= 1 - β-error risk) is set at 80%. Furthermore, an estimation of the expected difference in size between the experimental group and the control group is needed (effect size).

|Sample Type|Description|   |
|---|---|---|
|Simple Random Sample|Every member of a population can be included in the sample with the same probability. This is hoped to provide a representative depiction of the entire population.|   |
|Stratified Random Sample|The population is divided based on a characteristic that may be related to the characteristic being measured.|   |
|Cluster sampling|Groups are randomly selected from a total population, within which all individuals are then examined.|   |
|Consecutive Sample|All participants who are treated during a specific period and meet certain criteria are included in the sample.|   |
|Quota sample|The sample is divided proportionally (according to quotas) according to the total population. However, the investigator can freely select from the respective groups.|   |
|Ad-hoc sample|The investigator selects participants who are currently available. This sample is not very random and is therefore likely only minimally representative.|   |
|Multistage Sampling|The random selection of participants takes place in two or more stages: A random selection is drawn from a group, from which a subsequent random selection is then made. This method can be continued further depending on the group size.|   |
## Result Evaluation

In the end, it remains to be decided how reliable a study along with its results is and how one can possibly arrive at even more reliable analyses. The following points should be mentioned in this context:

- Reproducibility
    - Refers to the reproducibility of results, meaning that different studies must arrive at the same results for a fact to be considered reliable.
    - A single study on a topic is not enough to classify the results as reliable.
    - Errors may have arisen due to special conditions or randomly.
- Meta-analysis: A type of study that summarizes and quantitatively analyzes primary data from other studies on a specific topic.
    - Systematic approach
    - Effect sizes of the individual studies are summarized.
    - A high overall effect size can demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention.
    - Publication bias
        - Preferred publication of studies with significant results
        - Note on a publication bias: Smaller studies show larger effects than larger studies [1]
- Generalizability (External Validity)
    - Describes the generalizability of the results to other situations or populations.
- Evidence-Based Medicine
    - Medical treatments should only be applied when their effectiveness is proven by studies, if possible.
    - A meta-analysis of many randomized controlled individual studies has the highest evidence.

> [!NOTE] Guidelines
> Guidelines are recommendations for physicians on therapeutic approaches for certain diseases. They are generally created by medical professional societies (expert consensus) and are based on extensive literature research (especially meta-analyses). Guidelines are categorized into development grades (S1–3), and recommendations within the guidelines are provided with evidence classes (Ia–IV) to allow the reader to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic measures.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Fundamentals of Scientific Studies
### Hypothesis Formation

What do the terms induction and deduction mean?
- The terms induction and deduction describe how one can arrive at a hypothesis. Induction means deriving a general principle from a specific observation (e.g., a doctor observes that some patients complain of fatigue after taking a medication and concludes that the medication generally causes fatigue as a side effect), whereas deduction means applying a general principle to a specific case (a doctor who knows that the medication can cause fatigue concludes that the fatigue of his patient is due to this medication).

What is meant by the principle of falsification?
- The falsifiability of a statement or scientific theory means that it can be disproved. According to Karl Popper, scientific progress is based on the falsification (i.e., exclusion) of incorrect statements – this is referred to as the principle of falsification.

What distinguishes a deterministic hypothesis from a probabilistic hypothesis?
- A deterministic hypothesis predicts a connection between two factors with 100% certainty (example: If you stand in the rain, you will get wet). This is especially relevant in physics and mathematics, but very rarely in medicine. In medicine, probabilistic hypotheses are much more common: these predict a connection only with a certain probability; one hundred percent certainty is not given (e.g., people with alcohol dependence have a higher probability of developing liver cirrhosis, but not necessarily).

What is meant by a Type I error and a Type II error? Also explain the difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis!
- When testing hypotheses, a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis are formulated. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between two groups (example: the group taking pain medication X suffers from the same pain intensity as the group not taking the medication). The alternative hypothesis states that there is a difference between the two groups (example: the group taking pain medication X suffers from less pain intensity than the group not taking the medication). These two hypotheses are tested against each other. Subsequently, one of the hypotheses is accepted and the other rejected. Errors can occur: if the null hypothesis is mistakenly rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted (i.e., there is actually no difference between the two groups), this is called a Type I error. Conversely, a Type II error occurs if there is indeed a difference between the two groups, but the alternative hypothesis is mistakenly rejected.

### Investigation Planning

In an interventional study, what is being investigated and which study design has the highest level of evidence?
- An interventional study investigates the effect of a treatment measure (e.g., the effect of a medication). To do this, baseline values before the intervention (pre-time point) are compared with the values after the intervention (post-time point). The interventional study with the highest level of evidence is the randomized controlled trial.

How does a randomized controlled study proceed?
- In this interventional study, participants are randomized into an experimental group and a control group – this minimizes the influence of personal bias. In the experimental group, the intervention to be studied (e.g., administration of a new medication) is carried out, while no intervention takes place in the control group (participants receive, for example, only a placebo). The two groups are compared to assess the intervention.

What do you call the approach in which all participants (including study dropouts) of a randomized controlled trial are included in the analysis, and why is it so important?
- The approach in which all subjects (including study dropouts) of a randomized controlled study are included in the analysis is called the intention-to-treat principle. This is to exclude the possibility that similar or different results between the study groups arise due to a higher dropout rate in one of the two groups (e.g., because participants for whom the treatment does not work discontinue treatment).

How can subjective assessments (e.g., pain) be captured?
- Subjective assessments can be recorded using a rating scale. Such a rating scale has at least the level of an ordinal scale and thus enables the creation of a ranking, which simplifies or allows data evaluation. A typical example is pain scales.

What is meant by the Rosenthal effect and how can it be prevented?
- The Rosenthal effect (experimenter bias) occurs because the experimenter behaves differently toward different study participants (e.g., experimental and control groups) and thereby influences the study outcome. This is counteracted by double blinding: unlike single blinding, where only the study participants do not know which group they belong to, in double blinding the study leader also does not know which group the participants belong to.

How does a cross-sectional study work?
- In a cross-sectional study, one or more groups are examined for one or more characteristics at a specific point in time. It is less complex but also less informative than longitudinal studies. A typical example of a cross-sectional study is the measurement of the prevalence of a disease, in which one wants to know how many people in a population suffer from a particular disease at a specific time.

What is the difference between a prospective cohort study and a case-control study?
- In a prospective (forward-looking) longitudinal study, one or more groups are examined now and at a later time. This allows developmental courses to be recorded (e.g., exposure to a risk factor), but the approach is very time-consuming and costly. The case-control study is retrospective, meaning a case and a control group are investigated regarding past factors. The evidential value of this study is, however, low.

How is a cluster sample formed?
- In a cluster sample, groups are randomly selected from a total population. All members of these groups are included in the sample. For instance, to investigate primary care of patients in a large German city, ten general practitioner practices are randomly selected. In these ten general practices ("clusters"), all patients are included in the sample.

How is a quota sample formed?
- When conducting a quota sample, the study population is divided by quotas (i.e., percentage-wise). Within these quotas, the investigator has free choice (e.g., 50% of subjects must be children and 50% adults – which children and adults are studied can be chosen by the investigator).

How is a random sample formed?
- In a simple random sample, every member of the population to be studied can be selected with the same probability. The representation of the population should thus be as representative as possible.

### Result Evaluation

What is meant by a meta-analysis?
- In a meta-analysis, primary data from several studies are combined and quantitatively analyzed, whereby the effect sizes of the individual studies can also be combined. If the calculated overall effect is high, the effectiveness of an intervention is considered proven. Within evidence-based medicine, a meta-analysis of many randomized controlled individual studies has the highest evidence.
