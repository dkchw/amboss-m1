# General Histology
## Summary

The main tissue mass of the body is formed by cells that can be classified into four different basic tissue types: connective, muscle, nerve, and epithelial tissue. The first three forms will be addressed in separate learning units in connection with their functions. As a special component of nearly every body organ, the epithelial tissue and its subtypes and functions will be explained below.

All inner and outer body surfaces (except for the joint cavities) are formed by epithelial tissue: the skin (epidermis) and all mucous membranes. According to the predominant function, one distinguishes between the protective surface epithelia and the secreting glandular epithelia (so-called exocrine glands). The surface epithelia are named and classified based on several criteria (layering, cell shape, surface characteristics) (e.g. “stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium”). Similarly, there are also criteria for the classification of glandular epithelia such as the shape of the secretory cell arrangements (so-called glandular acini) or the type of secretion (thin serous or mucus-containing mucinous).

Allen epithelia is, however, the close relationship with the so-called basement membrane: It is a band-like layer of fibers and large proteins that is firmly connected to the cytoskeleton of the cells. Thus, all epithelia of the body, as well as many other cell types (e.g. glia and adipose tissue cells), sit on such a basement membrane that serves to anchor them to the surrounding connective tissue and simultaneously creates a diffusion barrier.

In histology, various fundamental terms are used for the tissue's adaptive reactions to external influences. Thus, tissues can grow due to increased or decreased stress (hypertrophy) or shrink (atrophy). When body cells die, two forms are distinguished: programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cell death caused by cell damage (necrosis).

## Overview of the Four Basic Tissue Types

One distinguishes four basic tissue types in the body: epithelial tissue, connective/supporting tissue, as well as nerve and muscle tissue. The epithelial tissue will be discussed in this chapter. The structure of the other three tissue types will be explained in their own respective chapters.

1. Connective-/supporting tissue: The connective- and supporting tissue can be further divided into four subtypes.
    - Connective tissue
    - Adipose tissue
    - Cartilage Tissue
    - Bone tissue
2. Nerve tissue
    - Discussed in the chapter Nervous Tissue, Synapses, and Transmitters
3. Muscle tissue: The muscle tissue is divided into two types based on structure and occurrence.
    - Striated Muscle
        - Cardiac muscle: Is discussed under Structure of the heart
        - Skeletal Muscle
    - Smooth Muscle
4. Epithelial Tissue
    - Surface epithelia
    - Glandular epithelia

## Epithelial Tissue

- Definition: Epithelium is one of the four basic tissue types, found in almost all organs in the form of covering and glandular tissue.
- Classification by function: Simplified, epithelia can be categorized based on their function into a protective surface epithelium and a secretory glandular epithelium.
    - Surface epithelia
    - Glandular epithelia
- Occurrence: Covers all external and internal body surfaces (skin and mucous membranes)
    - Exception: Synovial membrane (Synovialis): It is formed by synoviocytes (not epithelial cells!) that line the inner surfaces of joint capsules, bursae, and tendon sheaths.
- Origin: Various epithelial tissues arise from all three germ layers.
    - Ectoderm: Epithelium of skin and skin appendages
    - Mesoderm
        - Epithelial tissue of serous membranes (also referred to as "mesothelium"): peritoneum, pleura, and pericardial cavity
        - Lining cells of the intima of blood and lymph vessels (referred to as “endothelium”)
    - Endoderm: Epithelia of the airways and the gastrointestinal tract along with accessory glands (pancreas, liver)

## Surface Epithelia

- Definition: The surface epithelia are the cells that line the external and internal body surfaces (skin and hollow organs of the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital tracts).
- Functions
    - Protection against mechanical/chemical influences & harmful radiation
    - Material exchange
        - Resorption: For example, nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract
        - Secretion
- Classification: The surface epithelia are classified according to layering and arrangement, cell shape, and surface differentiations.

### Criteria for Classification

#### Layering and Sequencing

The terms "layering" and "stratification" are connected. Simple epithelia can be either simple layered or stratified - what is characteristic here is the fact that all cells are connected to the basement membrane. They are distinguished from stratified epithelia, where only the bottom cell layer is in contact with the basement membrane.

- Simple epithelium: Consists of a single layer of epithelial cells; all of these cells are connected to the basement membrane
    - Outline
        - Simple epithelium: Consists of cells of equal height; all cells are in contact with the basement membrane and the free organ surface.
        - Pseudostratified epithelium: Consists of cells of varying heights; all cells are in contact with the basement membrane, but only the larger cell types also make contact with the free surface of the organ.
- Stratified epithelium: Consists of multiple layers of epithelial cells; only the bottom layer is connected to the basement membrane

#### Cell shape

- Explanation: In the criterion of cell shape, only the topmost cell layer or cell row is determinative for the respective type of epithelium.
- Variations
    - Flat ("Squamous epithelium")
        - Appearance: Upper cells are very flat (width > height)
        - Examples: Skin Esophagus, Cervix uterus, Serosa (e.g. as peritoneum = Peritoneum)
    - Isoprismatic (cubic epithelium)
        - Appearance: Upper cells are approximately cube-shaped (Width = Height)
        - Examples: Bile Ducts , Renal Tubules
    - High prismatic (cylindrical epithelium)
        - Appearance: Upper cells are cuboidal or cylindrical (Width < Height)
        - Examples: Intestine (Enterocytes, Colonocytes) , Respiratory Tract (Respiratory Epithelium)

#### Surface Differentiations

One distinguishes two different types of surface differentiation in epithelial cells: on the one hand, the stratum corneum (keratinization) and on the other hand, the cell extensions (microvilli, stereocilia, cilia).

##### Hyperkeratosis (Stratum corneum)

Keratinized epithelium is found in the body only on the skin (stratum corneum). The epidermis is indeed a stratified keratinized squamous epithelium (see → The process of keratinization).

### Special Surface Epithelia

Some surface epithelia of the body combine several of the criteria mentioned above in a characteristic way or occur particularly frequently in various organs.

#### Stratified Keratinized Squamous Epithelium

Stratified keratinizing squamous epithelium occurs in the body only in the form of the epidermis. The structure and function are therefore discussed in relation to the skin (see: skin and skin appendages).

#### Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium

- Definition: Epithelium consisting of multiple cell layers, whose surface cells are flattened ("squamous") and show no keratinization.
- Structure: Three cell layers are distinguished.
    - Stratum basale: A layer of iso- to highly prismatic cells that sit on the basement membrane
    - Stratum intermedium: Several layers of polygonal cells
    - Superficial stratum: Several layers of flat cells
- Properties: Particularly resistant to mechanical stress (e.g., due to food passage)
- Occurrence
    - Conjunctiva of the eyeball (Conjunctiva bulbi) and eyelid (Conjunctiva palpebrae)
    - Oral cavity, Pharynx, Esophagus, Anal canal, Navicular fossa of the Urethra, Vagina

#### Urothelium (Transitional epithelium)

- Definition: Multilayered epithelium with variable epithelial height and cell shape (depending on the filling state of the urinary tract)
- Structure: One distinguishes three cell layers from the basement membrane to the surface (stratum basale, stratum intermedium, stratum superficiale)
    - Empty urinary bladder: 5–7 cell layers, cells in the stratum superficiale (multinucleated covering cells = Umbrella Cells) dome-shaped protruding
    - Filled bladder: 3–4 cell layers, surface cells flattened (“squamous”)
- Properties: Adaptability under variable pressure/volume loads, permeability barrier for urine and dissolved substances therein
- Occurrence
    - In the entire urinary tract: Renal pelvis, Ureter, Bladder, proximal Urethra
    - Exceptions: Pars spongiosa (stratified columnar epithelium) and Fossa navicularis (stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium) of the urethra

#### Respiratory Epithelium (respiratory ciliated epithelium)

- Definition: Multilayered columnar epithelium that carries cilia and has many interspersed goblet cells.
- Structure: Predominantly unicellular basal, goblet, and ciliated cells
    - Basal: Basal cells (stem cell reserve of the goblet and ciliated cells)
    - Luminal : Goblet cells (mucus-producing), Ciliated cells (bearing cilia)
- Properties: Cleans the airways through mucus secretion and ciliary movement directed upward (mucociliary clearance). The motility of the cilia is influenced by the properties of the secretions (e.g., impaired by thick mucus due to increased Na+ absorption through the bronchial epithelium)
- Occurrence: In the entire air-conducting respiratory tract: nasal cavity, nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, main bronchi down to the terminal bronchioles

#### Mesothel

- Definition: Derived from the lateral plate mesoderm, a single-layered squamous epithelium that lines the serous cavities (pericardial, pleural, and peritoneal cavity).
- Properties: Secretes and absorbs fluids and various substances (including ions, proteins)
    - The fluid film enables frictionless movements of the enveloped organs.
- Occurrence: Part of the serosa
    - Structure of the serosa
        - Serous epithelial layer (Mesothel)
        - Serous lamina propria

### Glandular Epithelia

In this section, the fundamentals of exocrine glands are discussed. The basics of hormone-producing, so-called endocrine glands are explained under “General Hormone Properties”.

- Definition: Glands are individual epithelial cells (e.g., goblet cells) or entire epithelial cell assemblies (e.g., parotid gland) that produce a substance with a specific function (secretion) and release it into the extracellular space.
- Function: Depending on the type of gland, secretion occurs from
    - Enzyme-containing digestive juices (saliva, stomach-, pancreatic juice)
    - Sweat
    - Talg
    - Milk production of the lactating mammary gland
    - Mucins: Protection of mucous membranes from drying out and mechanical/chemical influences
- Classification: Glandular epithelia can be classified based on their location, shape, secretion mechanism, and secretion characteristics.

### Criteria for Classification

#### Location of the gland cells

With regard to the position of glandular cells in relation to the surface epithelium, a distinction is made between intraepithelial (glandular cells located within the surface epithelium) and extraepithelial (glands located beneath the surface epithelium).

##### Intraepithelial Glands

- Definition: Glandular cells that are located within the surface epithelium
- Forms
    - Cup cell
        - Definition: Individual intraepithelial gland cell with a characteristic mucus-filled ("goblet-shaped") vacuole.
        - Function: Secretion of mucus (mucins)
        - Occurrences
            - Small intestine and Large intestine
            - Nasal mucosa and airways (see: Respiratory epithelium)
    - Secretory epithelium
        - Definition: Association of highly prismatic epithelial cells with strikingly bright (mucus-filled) cytoplasm, which, however, does not contain a vacuole.
        - Occurrence: For example, the surface epithelium of the stomach and the cervical canal is completely composed of this mucus-secreting epithelium

##### Extrapithelial Glands

- Definition: Glandular cells that lie beneath the surface epithelium from which they originate.
- Examples
    - The three major salivary glands: Parotid gland (Parotis), Submandibular gland, Sublingual gland
    - Pancreas
    - Lacrimal gland

###### Typical structure of extraepithelial glands

Since these glands migrate from the surface epithelium into the underlying connective tissue during embryogenesis, they have a more elaborate structure that consists of ducts and secretory end pieces. The components are listed below in the order corresponding to the path of secretion (from formation to discharge):

- Glandular end pieces
    - Definition: The end pieces are the bulbous, blind-ending parts of the gland that are connected to the ducts and in which the actual secretion production takes place.
    - Function: Secretion production and release into the lumen of the end piece (from there, the secretion drains into the duct)
    - Forms: There are different variants of end pieces (→ Shape of glandular end pieces)
- Execution path system
    - Definition: Ducts lined by epithelial cells that connect the glandular cells (in the acinus) with the gland opening
    - Function: secretion derivation, change in secretion composition (e.g. through addition/removal of ions)
    - Forms: Since extraepithelial glands are usually subdivided into lobules (lobuli) by connective tissue septa, several forms of ducts are distinguished.
        1. Intralobular ducts: Narrow ducts made of simple epithelium within the lobules that drain the acini into the larger interlobular ducts. In some glands, two special forms occur:
            - Switch pieces
                - Definition: First and thinnest segment of the execution pathway system made up of a single layer of flat to cuboidal epithelium with a narrow lumen.
                - Function: A switch piece drains several end pieces and either leads to a strip piece (if present in the gland) or directly into a larger intralobular duct.
                - Occurrence: Only in serous glands (Parotid gland, Pancreas) and in the serous gland sections of mixed Salivary glands (Submandibular gland, Sublingual gland)
            - Strips
                - Definition: The segment of the canal following the switching pieces made up of single-layered iso- to high-prismatic, eosinophilic epithelium with a wide lumen and "basal striation"
                    - Basal striation: Reddish (eosinophilic) stripes visible under a light microscope at the basal cell pole of epithelia, caused by the mitochondria-containing folds of the basal cell membrane.
                - Function: A strip piece drains several switching pieces and flows into a larger intralobular excretory duct.
                - Occurrence: Only in salivary glands (parotid gland, submandibular gland, sublingual gland)
        2. Interlobular ducts: Wide ducts made of single-layer iso- to high-columnar epithelium, which run between the lobules in broad connective tissue septa and drain into the main duct
        3. Main duct: The thickest and final section of the duct system made up of single to multiple layers of iso- to high-prismatic epithelium, which collects the secretion from all acini and directs it to the gland opening (rarely present in histological preparations)
            - Example: Two-layered, isoprismatic epithelium in terminal gland ducts, among others from apocrine and eccrine sweat glands as well as Gll. oesophageae

> [!NOTE]
> Segment pieces are only found in the three major salivary glands and in the exocrine pancreas! Stripes are, on the other hand, only present in the three major salivary glands!

    - Mechanism: Membrane protein-mediated transport
    - Occurrence: In almost all exocrine gland cells

    - Mechanism: Exocytosis
    - Occurrence: In almost all exocrine gland cells
- Apocrine secretion
    - Definition: Release of typically lipid-rich secretions through the budding off of apical cytoplasmic parts
    - Mechanism: Apoptosis
    - Occurrence: Only apocrine sweat glands and lactating mammary gland (Gl. mammaria)
- Holocrine secretion
    - Definition: Release of the entire cytoplasmic content through the breakdown of the gland cell.
    - Mechanism: Apoptosis of the gland cell (Holocytosis)
    - Occurrence: Only in the sebaceous glands

#### Confidentiality

Depending on the type of secret released, one distinguishes between serous, mucous, and seromucous glands.

- Serous gland
    - Secret: Thin and rich in protein/enzyme
    - Histological features
        - End pieces: Mostly azinous
        - Glandular cells: Basally rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum (basophilic staining), apically secretory granules (eosinophilic staining)

- Seromucous gland
    - Secret: Moderately viscous and containing mucin and enzymes
    - Histological features
        - End pieces: Usually tubuloacinous, often display Ebner's half-moons.
        - Glandular cells: Characteristics of both serous and mucous cells
    - Example: Gl. submandibularis

### Myoepithelial Cells

- Definition: Specialized cell type that has properties of both smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells.
- Function: Contraction (through typical proteins of smooth muscle such as actin, myosin and desmin filaments) → expulsion of glandular secretions
- Appearance: Star-shaped branched
- Occurrence: Located in some glands between the epithelia
    - Sweat-, Saliva- and Lacrimal glands
    - Mammary glands
    - Gll. esophageae
    - Respiratory Tract

### Basement membrane

The basement membrane is a special connection and covering structure between epithelial, glial, and muscle cells and the adjacent connective tissue. It consists of the typical macromolecules of the extracellular matrix, which form a molecular network here.

- Definition: Band-like structure made up of extracellular matrix components that is located between epithelial cells and connective tissue.
- Function
    - Anchoring of the epithelial tissue to the connective tissue
    - Diffusion barrier
- Occurrence: Basement membranes serve to connect connective tissue with the following cell types:
    - Epithelia and Endothelia
    - Glial cells
    - Fat and muscle cells
- Structure: The basement membrane consists of the basal lamina (which itself consists of two layers) and the fibroreticular lamina
    - Basal lamina (borders the epithelium)
        - Lamina rara (Lamina lucida)
            - Integrine
            - Collagen Type XVII (BP 180 = Bullous Pemphigoid Protein 180)
        - Dense layer
            - Collagen Type IV
            - Laminin
    - Lamina fibroreticularis (borders the connective tissue)
        - Reticular Fibers
        - Fibrils made of collagen Type III
        - Anchoring with basement membrane via fibrils made of collagen type VII

> [!NOTE]
> The basement membrane is formed by the basal lamina and the fibroreticular lamina! The basement membrane is usually recognizable microscopically, while the basal lamina can only be represented electron microscopically!

> [!NOTE] Epidermolysis bullosa
> Epidermolysis bullosa is a rare disease characterized by blister formation of the skin due to autoantibodies or a genetic defect. The cause is either antibodies against collagen type VII or a genetically induced faulty synthesis of adhesion and structural proteins (including collagen type VII). Since collagen type VII anchors the basal lamina to the underlying tissue, the defect in the skin leads to a disrupted mechanical cohesion of the basement membrane zone and consequently to blister formation.

### Basic Concepts of Histology

### Histological Techniques

- Light microscopy: The most commonly used method for examining individual cells (Cytology) as well as healthy (Histology) and pathologically altered tissue (Histopathology) in teaching and diagnostics.
    - For technical fundamentals and laws, see: Physical Principles of Light Microscopy
    - Representation (contrasting) of structures through dyes (including H.E. staining), if interested see: Staining procedures in pathology
- Electron microscopy: Primarily used for research purposes and the diagnosis of certain kidney-, muscle-, and CNS diseases with higher resolution than the light microscope
    - Representation (contrasting) of the structures by heavy metal-containing compounds (including osmium tetroxide)
- Immunohistochemistry: method used to identify cells more precisely by detecting specific structures acting as antigens (e.g., chromogranin A in the vesicles of endocrine cells) using an antigen-antibody reaction. The specific antibodies used recognize these structures and make them visible using fluorescent dyes.

## Review Questions on the Chapter General Histology
### Epithelial Tissue

Cell projections can be either immobile, passively movable, or actively motile. Which of these applies to microvilli, stereocilia, and cilia?
- Microvilli, stereocilia, and kinocilia are projections of the apical membrane of epithelial cells that differ in their motility. Microvilli are immobile and stiff; stereocilia cannot actively move but are at least capable of passive movements, especially in the spermatic ducts. Kinocilia can perform actively beating movements with ATP consumption.

Describe the structure and function of kinocilia!
- Kinocilia (ciliary hairs) are eyelash-shaped, actively motile cell projections. They consist of microtubule doublets arranged in a characteristic form (the so-called 9x2+2 structure = axoneme) and are anchored in the cytoplasm via basal bodies (kinetosomes). They are connected to each other via the motor protein dynein and nexin bridges and are actively motile through these connections. With ATP consumption, the microtubules can slide along each other, generating beating movements.

What common framework do microvilli and stereocilia share?
- Microvilli are finger-shaped cell projections each composed of bundles of actin filaments. These bundles are held together by actin-crosslinking proteins, e.g., fimbrin. Stereocilia are particularly long microvilli (approximately 10 μm) and consist of the same basic framework.

What are microvilli and where are they typically found?
- Microplicae are small, fold-like elevations of the apical membrane of the non-keratinized squamous epithelium. They enhance the adhesion of fluid films (e.g., on the cornea of the eye or the larynx) and thus protect the epithelium from drying out.

What is the special characteristic of the urothelium (transitional epithelium)?
- The urothelium covers the majority of the urinary tract. It is a stratified epithelium that can adapt to the respective filling state due to its strong elasticity. The uppermost cell layer (stratum superficiale) contains large umbrella cells which appear highly columnar to flat depending on the degree of stretch.

What is the function of goblet cells and where are they typically found?
- Goblet cells are single intraepithelial glandular cells containing "goblet-shaped" vacuoles from which mucus (mucins) can be secreted. They are found in the epithelium of the small and large intestines as well as in the nasal mucosa and the respiratory tract.

Describe the histological structure and the function of the main excretory ducts of exocrine glands!
- The main excretory duct is the thickest and last segment of the excretory duct system of exocrine glands and consists of one- to multilayered, iso- to high-columnar epithelium. It collects the secretion from all terminal parts and channels it to the gland opening.

Name an example of an acinar gland and a tubular gland and describe their typical secretion!
- Exocrine glands can be distinguished based on the shape of their terminal units. Since the terminal units are the sites of secretion formation, their shape also reflects the nature of their secretions. In the parotid gland and pancreas, the terminal units are berry-shaped and have narrow lumens; these are called acinar (Latin acinus = berry) and produce rather thin (serous) secretions. Tubular glands are tube-shaped with a wide, elongated lumen. Typically, all mucus-producing (mucous) glands (e.g., esophageal glands) are tubular.

Explain the mechanisms of apocrine and holocrine secretion!
- Exocrine glands can release their secretions by different mechanisms. In apocrine secretion, lipid-rich secretions are released by budding off apical cytoplasmic parts (so-called apocytosis); this type of secretion can be observed in apocrine sweat glands and the lactating mammary gland. In holocrine secretion, the entire (Greek holos = complete) cytoplasmic content is released through the disintegration of the gland cell (apoptosis). This occurs in sebaceous glands.

In which glands of the body do myoepithelial cells support secretion?
- Myoepithelial cells are specialized epithelial cells that support the expulsion of glandular secretion by contraction. They are located, for example, between epithelial cells of sweat, salivary, and lacrimal glands as well as mammary glands.

### Basement Membrane

Describe the structure and function of the basement membrane!
- The basement membrane is a mechanical connection between epithelium and connective tissue. It consists of the basal lamina and the lamina fibroreticularis, which are connected by fibrils made of collagen type VII.

Which type of collagen is responsible for anchoring the basement membrane to the underlying connective tissue? What happens in the event of a defect in this type of collagen?
- The basal lamina and lamina fibroreticularis as well as the underlying connective tissue are anchored to each other by fibrils made of collagen type VII (so-called anchoring fibrils). If there is a defect in this collagen type (e.g., genetically caused or by autoantibodies), fluid-filled blisters with scarring can form on the skin and mucous membranes.

### Basic Concepts of Histology

In which microscopic method are heavy metal compounds such as osmium tetroxide used to visualize structures?
- In high-resolution electron microscopy, an electron beam rather than a light source is used to visualize cells. Therefore, no conventional dyes are used but heavy metal-containing compounds (i.e., substances with high density) such as osmium tetroxide or lead citrate. This microscopic method is mainly used for research purposes.

Define atrophy and provide an example of pathological causes!
- Atrophy describes the regression of a tissue due to reduction in cell content or cell number. This is apparent, for example, as generalized atrophy in malnutrition or as localized atrophy in inactivity of a muscle (e.g., after a leg fracture).

Define metaplasia!
- Metaplasia is the transformation of a tissue through altered cell differentiation. It usually occurs as a cellular adaptation process in response to chronically altered environmental factors (e.g., chemical or physical stimuli). Metaplasia can fully revert but carries a risk of malignant degeneration and is therefore considered a facultative precancerous condition.

Describe roughly the process of cell necrosis!
- Necrosis (Greek nekrosis = "the killing") of a cell is never physiologically induced but always caused by irreversible cell damage. Initially, the damage triggers the disintegration of the cell nucleus; then water influx causes cell swelling and finally rupture of cell organelles and membranes. The released cell contents provoke an inflammatory reaction that leads to the breakdown of necrotic material.
