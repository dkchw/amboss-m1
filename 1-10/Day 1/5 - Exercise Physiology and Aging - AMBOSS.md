# Exercise Physiology and Aging
## Summary

The physiology of performance deals with how the body adapts to the specific challenges of physical work (e.g., sports) or special external conditions (e.g., staying at high altitudes, diving). This requires a coordinated effort of all organ systems, where, during physical work, an increase in blood flow, oxygen utilization, and metabolic performance are particularly relevant. These parameters can be improved through regular training – this can also be measured by investigations such as spiroergometry.

This chapter also contains information about the natural aging processes that occur in the body over the course of life. These changes affect all organ systems and also lead to a reduction in physical performance (e.g. through a decrease in vital capacity with increasing age).
## Fundamental Parameters of Exercise Physiology

### Specific Organ Blood Flow

To assess the blood flow of an organ, it is not enough to consider its share of the cardiac output. This depends not only on the needs of the respective organ but also on its size. For many questions, specific organ blood flow is therefore used.

- Definition
    - Measure of the blood flow to an organ relative to its mass
    - Unit: mL/(kg × min) or mL/(100 g × min)
- Examples
    - Highest specific organ perfusion: renal cortex with over 5,000 mL/(kg × min)
    - Low specific organ perfusion
        - Skeletal muscle at rest with 30 mL/(kg × min)
        - Adipose tissue with 80 mL/(kg × min)

### Specific Oxygen Consumption

The specific oxygen consumption of a tissue generally correlates with blood flow – after all, oxygen supply is an important function of blood circulation. However, these two quantities cannot be equated. While the renal cortex is characterized by the highest specific organ blood flow, there are tissues with a higher specific oxygen consumption, such as the gray matter of the brain or the myocardium.

- Definition
    - Measure of the oxidative activity of a tissue (primarily by the mitochondria)
    - Unit: mL/(kg×min)
- Determination: Measurement of the oxygen content before and after passing through an organ
    - Oxygen consumption of the entire body: Difference between arterial and mixed venous O2 content
        - Normal value: 180–250 mL O2/min, corresponds to an arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference of about 5 mL O2/100 mL blood
        - Increases due to stress
- Examples
    - At rest in the cortex of the brain and in the myocardium, it is highest at about 100 mL/(kg×min)
    - Highest specific oxygen consumption in the stressed myocardium with over 500 mL/(kg×min)

### Oxygen Depletion

- Definition
    - Share of oxygen that is removed from the blood during the perfusion of an organ
    - Results from the relationship between oxygen supply and consumption
- Determination: By measuring arterial and venous oxygen content
- Oxygen consumption at rest: For most organs about 25%
    - Exception: The heart already has an oxygen extraction of 50–70% at rest.
- Oxygen consumption under load: A strong increase to 80% and more is possible.
- Interpretation: Allows conclusions to be drawn about the relationship between oxygen supply and consumption
    - When the oxygen supply decreases, the venous oxygen content also decreases with constant consumption, and the oxygen extraction increases.

> [!note] Central venous saturation
> Central venous saturation refers to the oxygen saturation measured via a central venous catheter (CVC), specifically in the area of the superior or inferior vena cava near the right atrium. Normally, it is around 70% at rest. A low central venous saturation correlates with a high oxygen extraction throughout the body and therefore indicates an insufficient oxygen supply, for example, due to a low cardiac output.

> [!note] Mixed venous saturation
> The mixed venous saturation is measured, unlike the central venous saturation, not in the cava veins, but in a pulmonary artery. The values correlate closely, but the mixed venous saturation represents the oxygenation status of the entire body even better: Here, all the blood from both halves of the body and the venous blood from the heart are included. However, it is problematic that the measurement can only be performed via a pulmonary catheter – hence, in practice, central venous saturation is more common.

### Respiratory Quotient

- Definition: Relationship between CO2 emission and O2 uptake
    - RQ = VCO2/VO2
- Meaning: Provides insight into the metabolic state
    - In aerobic glycolysis, the same amount of oxygen is consumed as carbon dioxide is generated: Pure carbohydrate utilization (RQ=1)
    - In fatty acid oxidation, more oxygen is required than carbon dioxide is released: Pure fat utilization (RQ=0.7)

### CO2 Production (CO2 Emission)

- Definition: Product of alveolar ventilation and alveolar CO2 fraction
    - CO2 production (VCO2) = alveolar ventilation × alveolar CO2 fraction
- Meaning: Allows conclusions to be drawn about CO2 production under load

## The Organ Systems at Rest and Under Stress

Some organs (e.g., skeletal muscle) increase their consumption under stress, while other organ systems (e.g., the digestive system) are more active at rest. This is controlled partly by the autonomic nervous system, and locally, there is a metabolic autoregulation. The following is an overview of general adaptations to physical stress as well as blood flow, oxygen consumption, and metabolism at rest and under stress for the individual organs and organ systems.

### Heart and Myocardial Metabolism

The pumping capacity of the heart is always regulated so that it is adapted to the oxygen demand of the individual organs or tissues. The cardiac output can increase from about 5 L/min at rest to over 30 L/min during physical activity. During light work with a constant load, a plateau value of heart rate and stroke volume is reached. However, for heavy work, such a plateau does not exist, so the work must be paused or stopped in case of exhaustion.

- General adjustments under physical stress
    - Sympathetic tone↑
        - Heart rate↑ (positive chronotropic)
        - Stroke volume↑ (positive inotrope)
        - Cardiac output↑
- Coronary circulation
    - In peace
        - Approx. 5% of the cardiac output
        - Specific organ perfusion already very high (for pumping work and structural maintenance)
    - Under load: Increase in absolute blood flow up to 6 times possible
    - Regulation
        - Local: Metabolic autoregulation through metabolic products (Adenosine↑, CO2↑, pH↓) and chemical autoregulation via NO release by coronary endothelial cells → Vasodilation of the coronaries
        - Systemic: By activating the sympathetic nervous system
            - Effect: Sympathetic tone↑ → Norepinephrine and epinephrine release↑ → Cardiac output↑, O2 consumption↑
            - Increase in coronary blood flow: Blood flow is increased through β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilation.
- Oxygen depletion
    - In peace
        - Already high (50–70%), this indicates that the coronary venous O2 partial pressure is below 40 mmHg.
        - With higher demand, hardly any reserves.
    - Under load
        - Increase hardly possible → More perfusion for adequate supply
- Specific oxygen consumption
    - At rest approximately 100 mL/(kg × min) and thus very high!
    - In case of load, further increase to 5 times.
- Metabolism
    - Flexible regarding energy carriers: Utilizes glucose, lactate, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies
    - During physical work, the heart uses the lactate produced by the muscles.

> [!note]
> The distribution of cardiac output to the various organ systems can adjust to meet the respective needs!

### Circulation and Blood Pressure

- General adjustments under physical stress
    - Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (Sympathetic tone↑ → Norepinephrine and adrenaline release↑ → Systolic blood pressure↑)
        - Static work
            - HZV↑ + total peripheral resistance↑ → Systolic and diastolic blood pressure↑
        - Dynamic Work
            - Sympathetic activation leads to vasoconstriction; however, due to local changes (e.g., from lactate, pH level), there is vasodilation of the working muscles → Slightly increased or even decreased total peripheral resistance → Diastolic blood pressure remains about the same.
            - HZV↑ → Systolic blood pressure↑
            - Effect: Blood pressure amplitude↑, slightly elevated mean arterial pressure

### Lungs and Lung Metabolism

- General adjustments under physical stress
    - Respiratory rate↑
    - Tidal volume↑
    - Tidal volume↑
        - Demand-appropriate hyperventilation (hyperpnea) below the anaerobic threshold
            - At the beginning, measurement of the respiratory equivalent for O2 and CO2 (improved gas exchange), with prolonged exertion an increase.
        - Disproportionate increase in respiratory minute volume (hyperventilation) above the anaerobic threshold
- Circulation
    - General: Is perfused by the entire HZV
    - Under load: With an increase in cardiac output, there is also an increase in pulmonary blood flow (to the same extent)
        - With increasing blood flow, vascular resistance is lowered.
    - In case of under-ventilation: Local vasoconstriction with decreasing alveolar oxygen partial pressure (Euler-Liljestrand mechanism)

### Brain and Brain Metabolism

- Circulation
    - In peace
        - High blood circulation: High metabolic activity, operation of ion pumps, structural maintenance
        - Despite low weight, a high proportion of cardiac output (approximately 15%)
    - During physical exertion
        - Only slightly variable: A maximum of 4-fold increased blood flow is possible
        - Blood circulation is not decreased (most sensitive organ!)
    - Regulation
        - Pronounced autoregulation of blood flow through the arterioles: Perfusion relatively independent of circulation; in the range of mean arterial blood pressure from 50 to 150 mmHg, cerebral blood flow can be maintained constant through vasoconstriction (with pressure increase) and vasodilation (with pressure decrease) (see also: Bayliss effect)
- Specific oxygen consumption
    - Gray matter: Very high specific oxygen consumption
    - White matter: Lower consumption
- Metabolism
    - Usually almost exclusively glucose
    - In situations of scarcity, also ketone bodies
    - Other energy carriers hardly usable
### Metabolism of the Digestive System

- Circulation
    - At rest: High blood flow during strong metabolic activity and for nutrient absorption (approx. 30% of cardiac output)
    - During physical exertion: Reduction of blood flow due to vasoconstriction: Redistribution to other organ systems (especially skeletal muscles)!
    - Regulation: Vasoconstriction via α1-adrenergic receptors under stress

> [!note] Ischemic colitis
> An ischemic colitis is an inflammation of the intestinal mucosa caused by a lack of oxygen. It can primarily be observed in older people with vascular diseases, but it can also affect young individuals under significant stress (e.g., during a marathon). Due to the redistribution of cardiac output in favor of the muscles, there is a reduced blood supply to the intestines.

### Kidney and Kidney Metabolism

- Circulation
    - In peace
        - High blood flow (about ¼ of cardiac output): A lot of metabolic activity and energy-dependent ion pumps
        - Very high specific blood flow: Approx. 400 mL/min/100 g
        - About 1 L of blood/min flows through the kidneys.
    - Under load: Blood flow remains largely constant (through myogenic autoregulation)
- Oxygen extraction: Very low, only a small portion of the very large oxygen supply is consumed during the flow through the kidneys.
- Specific oxygen consumption
    - Very high in the renal cortex (there the main part of the metabolic activity)
    - In the renal medulla significantly lower

### Metabolism of Skeletal Muscle

- Circulation
    - In peace
        - Low specific blood flow (barely any activity, only structural preservation)
        - Due to the large mass of relevant share in the HZV (roughly 15–20% depending on the constitution)
    - Under load
        - Extreme increase in performance: Blood circulation up to 20× higher under maximum load!
        - Under maximum load, the largest share of the efficiency-optimizing system.
- Regulation
    - Metabolic Autoregulation: Metabolic products generated under stress (including adenosine, CO2) → Local vasodilation → Blood flow↑
    - Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increase of cardiac output
- Specific oxygen consumption
    - Slightly at rest (only for structural preservation)
    - Under stress, massive increase due to oxidative energy carrier breakdown: O2 demand increased up to 50 times!
- Metabolism
    - Energy provision
        - Initial about ATP reserves, then about creatine phosphate and anaerobic glycolysis
        - In the case of prolonged stress: Through aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation
        - In case of exceeding the duration performance limit: Further lactate production through anaerobic glycolysis with possible metabolic acidosis or cessation of work.
        - For more information see: Provision of energy for contraction

### Metabolism of the Skin

The skin consumes only a small amount of oxygen and energy carriers; its blood circulation primarily serves the purpose of temperature regulation.

- Circulation
    - Depending on body and ambient temperature
    - No direct load dependency
    - Strong increases possible in extreme situations (like sauna): Up to 5 L/min
- Regulation of blood flow: During exertion, the sympathetic nervous system causes vasoconstriction in the skin via α1-adrenergic receptors.
    - Blood circulation of the skin has low priority
    - With increased demand, the blood is redistributed to other organs (centralization) → Pale skin
- Specific oxygen consumption: Very low (hardly any metabolic activity)
- Heat balance: Dynamic exercise leads to an increase in core body temperature as part of thermoregulation.

The heat generated by dynamic work poses a significant strain on the organism!
### Autonomic Nervous System and Hormones

- Cardiovascular activation through sympathetic activation and increased adrenaline secretion
- Energy supply through increased blood sugar and fatty acid levels due to
    - Glucagon↑
    - Growth hormone↑
    - Cortisol↑ (with a significant time lag)
- Increased water and salt reabsorption in the kidney to reduce the salt and water loss caused by sweating.
    - ADH↑
    - Aldosterone↑

## Training and Performance Diagnostics

### Training Effects

Through regular training, the body can adapt to increased demands. Through aerobic training (endurance training), the cardiovascular parameters primarily improve, while in anaerobic training (strength training), the coordination and the number of actin and myosin filaments are enhanced. These training effects are particularly evident during physical work, but some are also visible at rest.

#### Heart

- Increased stroke volume due to:
    - Dilation of the Heart
    - Hypertrophy of the wall muscle
- Heart size and weight increase.
- Heart rate: Decreased at rest due to the increased stroke volume.

#### Circulation

- Blood pressure drops
- Plasma volume increases
- The number of erythrocytes remains constant.

#### Lunge

- Maximum oxygen uptake can increase by up to 20%.
- Tidal volume can increase further during exertion; at the same time, it is lower than in untrained individuals due to improved oxygen uptake at the same performance level.

#### Skeletal Muscle

- Improvement of capillarization
- Increase in mitochondrial density

### Performance Diagnosis

The performance diagnostics include various testing procedures that can be used to determine endurance and performance levels. It is often used in sports and occupational medicine. Performance diagnostics can also be useful in cardiopulmonary diseases to provide exercise recommendations. The most important method is spiroergometry.

#### Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing

For assessing performance, spiroergometry is particularly suitable. In this procedure, spirometry is performed before, during, and after physical exertion (usually cycling on an ergometer). This allows for the examination of the effects of exertion on the heart, circulation, respiration, and metabolism.

- Determination of parameters
    - The lung function
        - Minute ventilation (Ve), respiratory rate (RR)
        - Tidal volume (TV = Ve / RR)
        - Oxygen uptake (VO₂), carbon dioxide output (VCO₂)
        - Alveolar oxygen fraction: FAO₂ = FiO₂ – VO₂ / VA (FiO₂ = fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.21, VA = alveolar ventilation)
        - Alveolar carbon fraction: FACO₂= VCO₂ /VA
    - Of the energy budget
        - Respiratory Quotient (RQ = VCO2/VO2)
            - Exceeding the continuous performance limit: RQ > 1
        - Oxygen equivalent for ventilation (OEE = Ve / VO₂) and carbon dioxide (CEE = Ve / VCO₂)

#### Determination of the Long-Term Load Limit

The term "endurance performance threshold" refers to the limit up to which static or dynamic work can be maintained without muscular fatigue for more than 8 hours. The heart rate remains constant at a plateau ("steady state"). When the load exceeds the endurance performance threshold, signs of fatigue occur and the heart rate continuously rises.

- Options for determination
    - Determination of the anaerobic threshold
        - Greatest performance that can just barely be achieved in a lactate equilibrium
        - Method: Measurement of lactate levels in the blood under increasing load
    - Determination of the respiratory compensation point
        - Waste of the CO2 fraction in the exhaled air
        - Method: Spiroergometry

#### Differences between Untrained Individuals and Athletes at Rest and Under Stress

Through regular training, not only can performance be improved, but also in rest, the higher resilience of athletes compared to non-athletes becomes noticeable.

| Values              | At Rest    |           | Under Load                                                                                             |                 |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Untrained           | Athlete    | Untrained | Athlete                                                                                                |                 |
| Heart minute volume | 5 L/min    |           | 20–25 L/min                                                                                            | 35 L/min        |
| Stroke volume       | 70 mL      | 140 mL    | 100 mL                                                                                                 | 190 mL          |
| Heart rate          | 70/min     | 50/min    | Up to about 200/min                                                                                    |                 |
| Heart Weight        | 300 g      | 500 g     | These two values do not change under acute stress, but only within the framework of long-term training |                 |
| Blood Volume        | 5.3 L      | 5.9 L     |                                                                                                        |                 |
| Tidal volume        | 6–8 L/min  |           | >100 L/min                                                                                             | up to 200 L/min |
| O2 uptake           | 0.25 L/min |           | 3.5 L/min                                                                                              | 5 L/min         |

> [!note]
> The cardiac output is increased under exertion both by an increase in heart rate and by an increase in stroke volume. However, the stroke volume increases only marginally in relative terms!

## Adjustment to Special Printing Conditions

Both when diving underwater and at high altitudes, the body must cope with special pressure conditions. In particular, the breathing must adapt (increased respiratory effort), which limits physical performance at high altitudes and diving depth. If adaptation is insufficient, severe damage, especially to the lungs and brain, can occur in both cases.

### Diving

In water, the ambient pressure increases by about 1 bar (= 100 kPa) for every 10 meters of water depth. As a result, lung volume decreases: According to Boyle's Law, at constant temperature, volume decreases as pressure increases (p × V = constant). The partial pressures also rise, which is why at great depths not only is oxygen absorbed particularly well, but also other gases such as nitrogen, for example. This can lead to narcosis and decompression sickness during scuba diving.

- Apnea diving
    - Dive reflex: Ensuring blood supply to O2-sensitive organs while diving
        - Vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels and subsequent centralization of the blood circulation
            - Blood Shift: Increased blood flow to the lungs through a complex interplay of pressure and circulation.
        - Ambient pressure↑ → increased venous return → stretching of the right atrium → activation of atrial stretch receptors (Gauer-Henry reflex) → diver diuresis
        - Bradycardia and reduced cardiac output
        - Apnea
    - Extension of the apnea time possible through hyperventilation before diving
- Snorkeling
    - Breathing through the snorkel increases the functional dead space → tidal volume increases (this, however, does not limit diving depth!)
    - Through the snorkel, the intrapulmonary pressure corresponds to the atmospheric pressure of 100 kPa, while the hydrostatic pressure from outside acts on the thorax.
        - At approximately 40 cm diving depth: Pressure difference can cause damage to the alveoli.
        - Starting at a diving depth of 1 meter: The respiratory muscles can no longer overcome the force acting on the thorax.

### Height

The standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 100 kPa = 1 bar. However, it continuously decreases with increasing altitude (approximately halving every 5500 m), and so does the partial pressure of the individual gas fractions.

- Short-term adjustments at high altitude
    - Increased heart rate
    - Hyperventilation due to low arterial O2 partial pressure
        - This causes a respiratory alkalosis → Left shift of the oxygen binding curve
    - Performance drop: Measurable from 1,500 m
- Altitude sickness
    - Mechanism: Hypoxic dysregulation of blood vessels due to inadequate adaptation to low O2 partial pressure and resulting arterial oxygen saturation <90% during rapid ascent.
    - Follow
        - Brain: Vasodilation, impaired autoregulation, presumably increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier → Principal symptom headaches (also loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, oliguria, dizziness and other nonspecific symptoms possible)
        - Lunge: Narrowing of the pulmonary vessels → Pulmonary hypertension → Increase in right ventricular pressure in the heart
        - Transition to HACE/HAPE possible (development of cerebral/pulmonary edema)
- Long-term acclimatization:
    - Increased synthesis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) in erythrocytes → Rightward shift of the oxygen binding curve
    - Renal oxygen partial pressure↓ → EPO↑ → Erythropoiesis↑ → Hematocrit↑ → Improved oxygen supply to the tissues

> [!note]
> In intermediate altitudes, the rightward shift of the oxygen binding curve due to 2,3-BPG predominates, while in extreme altitudes, the leftward shift due to respiratory alkalosis occurs!

## Changes in Old Age

All body cells undergo a natural aging process. This is caused by DNA damage and DNA repair mechanisms. These changes affect all organ systems and also lead to a decrease in physical performance.

### Bone Skeleton

- Changes in calcium metabolism lead to a decrease in bone mass and thus to increased brittleness.

### Musculature

- Atrophy of muscle fibers and replacement of muscle mass by connective tissue and fat cells → Decrease in performance

### Heart

- The wall thickness of the left ventricle increases, while the heart size does not change.
- Poorer response to β-adrenergic stimuli
- The maximum heart rate decreases.

### Circulation and Vessels

- Sclerosis as well as loss of stability and elasticity of the arteries
    - Follow
        - Systolic blood pressure rises and thereby the mean arterial pressure also increases.
        - Increased risk of aneurysm formation (e.g., aortic aneurysm)

### Lunge

- Increase in the stiffness of the thoracic skeleton and decrease in elastic fibers in the lung → Compliance and elasticity decrease, vital capacity decreases, airway resistance increases, residual volume rises.
- Reduction of the alveolar septa and thus an increase in alveolar size → The gas exchange surface becomes smaller and the maximum oxygen uptake is lower.
- Cough reflex and defense mechanisms are weakened → Increased susceptibility to infections
### Kidney

- Decrease in glomerular filtration rate due to:
    - Increasing sclerosis of the renal vessels and the basement membranes of the nephrons → Less is filtered per nephron
    - Decrease in the number of nephrons

### Nerve Cells and Sensory Physiology

- Reduced nerve conduction velocity and delayed synaptic transmission → Reaction time decreases
- Presbyacusis: High frequencies are increasingly poorly perceived; speech comprehension also declines.
- Presbyopia (age-related farsightedness): The elasticity of the lens decreases, the accommodation range decreases, which is why the near point shifts away from the eye.

### Intelligence and Memory

- Strong interindividual variability regarding the decline of cognitive functions with increasing age
    - Protective factors: Among others, high socioeconomic status, frequent and stable social contacts, societal participation
    - Predisposing factors: Among others, multimorbidity, social isolation, event-poor daily life

## Review Questions on the Chapter Performance Physiology and Aging
### Basic Sizes

How is the body's oxygen consumption calculated and what is it normally at rest?
- The O2 consumption of the organism can be calculated using the difference in oxygen content in the arterial and mixed venous blood and the cardiac output (arterial-mixed venous O2 difference in mL/L × CO in L/min = O2 consumption in mL/min). The normal value is 180–250 mL O2/min.

What causes the arterial-mixed venous O2 difference to increase?
- The arterial-mixed venous O2 difference increases during physical exertion (because more O2 is consumed and thus the mixed venous O2 saturation decreases).

How is the respiratory quotient calculated and what can be derived from it?
- The respiratory quotient refers to the ratio of CO2 output to O2 uptake. From the amount of produced CO2 per inhaled oxygen amount, conclusions can be drawn about the metabolized metabolites and the metabolic state (anaerobic vs. aerobic) during physical exertion. For example, fat metabolism produces less CO2 than carbohydrate metabolism (RQ fats < RQ carbohydrates).

What is referred to as oxygen depletion and is it always consistent?
- The oxygen extraction indicates how much O2 is withdrawn from the arterial blood during the perfusion of an organ. Under exertion or with constant O2 consumption during reduced perfusion, O2 extraction can sometimes be significantly increased (exception: heart!).

How can one calculate the body's CO2 production using alveolar ventilation?
- The CO2 production is the product of alveolar ventilation × alveolar CO2 fraction.

### Organ Systems at Rest and Under Load

What adjustments occur in the circulation and metabolism of the heart under stress?
- Since the heart's O2 extraction is already about 70% at rest, perfusion must be increased by dilation of the coronary arteries up to 6 times to meet the increased O2 demand. In addition to glucose, free fatty acids, and ketone bodies, lactate produced by skeletal muscle also serves as an energy carrier.

What causes the coronary arteries to dilate under stress?
- A metabolic autoregulation through metabolic products (adenosine ↑, CO2 ↑, pH ↓) and activated β2 receptors due to increased sympathetic tone lead to dilation of the coronaries during exertion.

Through which mechanism can vascular resistance be reduced in the lung?
- At rest, only about 50% of the lung capillaries are perfused. During exertion, pressure-passive opening of reserve capillaries occurs due to increased lung blood flow, which enlarges the gas exchange surface and reduces vascular resistance.

How is the blood circulation of the brain regulated?
- Cerebral blood flow is controlled by autoregulation of arterioles. These increase or decrease flow resistance by constriction or dilation and thus regulate blood flow. With systemic blood pressures between 50 and 150 mmHg, constant brain perfusion is maintained.

What proportion of the cardiac output is accounted for by the blood flow to individual organs?
- The lungs receive the entire cardiac output, the kidneys about 20–25%, and the brain 15%, while the heart itself only claims 5% of the CO. Blood flow to the digestive system and skeletal muscles depends on their activity, and blood flow to the skin mainly on body and ambient temperature.

How much can the blood flow to the skeletal muscles be increased?
- During exertion, blood flow to skeletal muscles can be increased up to 20 times.

Why is the blood in the renal veins hardly desaturated?
- The high renal blood flow (~¼ of cardiac output) is necessary for filtration function, not for oxygen supply. Due to the low oxygen extraction of the kidneys, the blood in the renal veins is hardly desaturated.

How does the metabolism of skeletal muscle change with prolonged exertion?
- Energy supply in skeletal muscle initially occurs via creatine phosphate and anaerobic glycolysis, during sustained exertion via aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. During sustained light exertion, aerobic energy production predominates; during sustained heavy exertion, anaerobic mechanisms must also contribute, which increases lactate concentration.

What is referred to as the training effect? Provide examples of this!
- Training effects describe adaptations of the body to increased demands, for example, an increased stroke volume due to heart muscle hypertrophy, a lower heart rate at rest, and an increase in plasma volume (to compensate for sweating).

What effect do the increased cardiac output under load and the resulting increased pulmonary perfusion have on gas exchange?
- An increased cardiac output automatically raises pulmonary perfusion. This allows more CO2 to be released and more O2 to be taken up. O2 uptake can be increased to more than 15 times the resting value by simultaneously increasing respiratory rate, tidal volume, and oxygen extraction.

What increases the cardiac output during exercise?
- During exertion, cardiac output is mainly increased by heart rate; stroke volume can only be increased slightly in the short term. Endurance training causes heart muscle hypertrophy ("athlete's heart"), which enables a higher stroke volume and thus higher cardiac output under exertion in the long term.

### Adjustment to Special Printing Conditions

How much does the ambient pressure increase per 1 m of depth while diving?
- In water, ambient pressure increases by approx. 10 kPa per 1 m water depth.

Why can't snorkeling be done with a longer snorkel?
- The pressure difference between hydrostatic and atmospheric pressure at depths beyond 1 m is too high for the respiratory muscles to overcome. Even at lesser depths the pressure difference can damage the alveoli (which is why the snorkel should not be extended beyond 35 cm).

How does the O2 partial pressure of inspired air change at high altitude?
- Air pressure decreases with altitude. Since the ratio of the different gases in the air remains constant, the O2 partial pressure also decreases.

How and why does the pH level of the blood change at high altitude? Describe the pathomechanism of altitude sickness!
- At low O2 partial pressure, respiratory rate increases, causing more CO2 to be exhaled — respiratory alkalosis develops. This shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the left, facilitating O2 uptake. Altitude sickness arises because the respiratory alkalosis can no longer be compensated. This results in hypoxic and pH-dependent dysregulation of vessels, including dilation of cerebral vessels. Constriction of pulmonary vessels leads to pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. The blood pressure increase causes, especially, brain and lung edema.

### Changes in Old Age

What usually causes the systolic blood pressure to increase with age?
- Due to sclerosis and loss of elasticity of arteries, systolic (and thus also mean) arterial blood pressure usually increases with age.

How do lung volumes change with age?
- With aging, the elasticity (compliance) of lung tissue decreases, leading to a reduction in vital capacity. At the same time, airway resistance and residual volume increase.

Why does maximum oxygen uptake decrease with increasing age?
- Due to a reduction of the gas exchange surface area as part of age-related remodeling processes of the lung tissue, oxygen uptake decreases.
