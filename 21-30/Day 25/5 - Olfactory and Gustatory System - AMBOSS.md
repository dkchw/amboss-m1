# Olfactory and Gustatory System
## Summary

The taste and the sense of smell are summarized as the "chemical senses" of humans, as they are activated by chemical substances (fragrance substances, flavoring substances). These substances are bound by specially configured receptors in the area of the tongue ("taste") and the nose ("smell"), thereby triggering a signal cascade that is transmitted through several stations to the cerebrum. Both senses are closely linked and usually work together. Since they are connected to the limbic system, there is always a subjective evaluation of the smell and taste sensation. Some sensory perceptions, such as the taste perception "spicy" or the smell perception "ammonia," are perceived through the trigeminal nerve. In addition to the mentioned sensations, the chemical senses are also responsible for triggering certain reflexes that are (from an evolutionary biological perspective) vital for survival.
## Smelling

The human being is capable of distinguishing several thousand different scents. The task of the sense of smell is, among other things, to inform about food sources, to initiate digestive reflexes, and to warn of dangers (e.g., fire). Furthermore, smell has a strongly hedonic (pleasure-oriented, subjective) component and thereby influences our mood and well-being.

### Olfactory Region (Olfactory Mucosa)

In the nasal mucosa, in addition to the respiratory region (respiratory nasal mucosa), which lines the lower two nasal conchae, there is also the olfactory region (olfactory mucosa). The olfactory mucosa covers the superior nasal concha, the opposing part of the nasal septum, and the nasal dome.

- Epithelium of the olfactory region: Pseudostratified epithelium (also known as "olfactory epithelium") with four cell types, a lamina propria, and special olfactory mucus
    - Olfactory mucus: Secreted by the Bowman glands (Glandulae olfactoriae)
    - Cell types
        1. Olfactory sensory cells: Primary sensory cells
            - Number: 10–30 million
            - Structure: Bipolar
                - Basal: Axone
                - Apical: Dendrites with olfactory bulbs and cilia
            - Lifespan: 30–60 days
        2. Basal cells: Undifferentiated, dividing stem cells; continuously generate new olfactory sensory neurons
        3. Support cells: Epithelial cells that support the tissue and also produce mucus, which is released into the nasal lumen.
        4. Microvilli cells: Function so far unclear

### Scent Detection

- Fragrances: Small and easily volatile substances that are mostly lipophilic and consist of a mixture of various substances.
- Odorant receptors: G-protein coupled receptors in the ciliary membrane of olfactory sensory cells
    - Structure: Polypeptide chains that spiral into the cell membrane of the cilia and form a binding pocket for the odorants
    - Specificity: There are about 1000 genes for olfactory receptors → Each cell expresses only one type of receptor → However, one type of receptor can bind not just one, but a group of odorants!
- Olfactory perception: Odorant binds to the binding pocket of the receptor → Activation of the G-protein → Activation of an adenylate cyclase → Formation of cAMP from ATP → Binding of cAMP to the cAMP-controlled ion channels (so-called "CNG channels") of the ciliary membrane → Opening of the CNG channels → Influx of Na+ and Ca2+-ions into the sensory cell → Depolarization of the olfactory sensory cell → Opening of Ca2+-controlled chloride channels due to incoming calcium → Outflow of Cl− → Amplification of depolarization → Transmission of action potentials through the axons (N. olfactorius) to the olfactory bulb
    - Detection threshold: concentration at which a smell is perceived but not yet identified.
    - Detection threshold: Concentration at which a substance can be identified
        - The identification of a fragrance does not occur through the activation of a single olfactory sensory cell, but rather through the simultaneous activation of multiple olfactory sensory cells (a phenomenon also referred to as the so-called "across-the-fibre-pattern").
        - The detection threshold requires a concentration of the fragrance that is about 10 times higher than the discovery threshold.
- In the nasal mucosa, in addition to the sensory cells, there are also fibers of the trigeminal nerve that also respond to various odorants; they are primarily responsible for the perception of sharp odors such as chlorine or ammonia.

> [!NOTE]
> The odor thresholds are not constant parameters, as the sensitivity of the receptors can change. For example, during hunger, the odor threshold for many substances decreases, as does for women during ovulation or pregnancy!

### Adaptation

After a certain period, there is a "habituation" (adaptation) of the sensory cells to a bound odorant. In this mechanism, the calcium that flows into the sensory cell through the CNG channels after receptor binding plays a crucial role. After adaptation, a residual perception of the odorant usually remains at about 25% of its original strength. This is known from everyday life when one "gets used to a smell." The phenomenon of adaptation also exists in taste perception.

#### Process

1. Influxed Calcium binds to Calmodulin
2. The Calcium-Calmodulin complex reduces the cAMP sensitivity of the CNG channels and activates a phosphodiesterase that breaks down cAMP.
3. The CNG channels close despite the persistent odor stimulus.
4. The cell is now less easily excitably, the threshold for discovery rises.
5. After some time, the cell returns to its resting state.

### Riechbahn

Under "olfactory pathway," all neurons are summarized that transmit the sensory impression from the olfactory receptors to the processing areas of the brain.

- 1. Neuron
    - Axons of the olfactory sensory cells come together to form bundles (olfactory filaments)
    - They enter as olfactory fila through the lamina cribrosa, unite to form the olfactory nerve, and project to the olfactory bulb (“olfactory bulb”)
- 2. Neuron
    - In the olfactory bulb, multiple neurons with the same selectivity (same odorant receptor) converge in so-called glomeruli
    - The glomeruli serve as a relay station and form synapses with so-called mitral cells and tufted cells (= 2nd neuron)
    - Through lateral inhibition of the mitral cells using so-called granule cells and interneurons (periglomerular cells), there is a contrast enhancement, allowing odorants to be better distinguished.
    - Further course of the axons as the olfactory tract
        - Division of the olfactory tract in the olfactory trigone into two parts
            1. Lateral olfactory stria: Has three projection targets
                - Amygdaloid body (Amygdala)
                - Prerhinal Cortex (primary olfactory cortex)
                - Entorhinal Cortex
            2. Medial olfactory stria: Has two projection targets
                - Olfactory tubercle
                - Septum region (Septal area)

> [!NOTE]
> The olfactory tract is the only afferent pathway that does not project directly to the thalamus. The fibers reach the thalamus only after an initial perception and processing in the cerebrum!

> [!NOTE] Hyposmia/Anosmia
> Disorders of the sense of smell can occur in the form of reduced olfactory ability (hyposmia) or in the form of a complete loss (anosmia). Causes include, for example, swelling of the nasal mucosa due to a cold, damage to the olfactory mucosa, or a traumatic avulsion of the olfactory fila (e.g., in the case of a skull base fracture). But neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease can also be responsible for disorders of the sense of smell. Very often, there are partial anosmias ("olfactory blindness")—that is, the inability to perceive specific odors. In older age, there is a physiological hyposmia due to atrophy of the olfactory epithelium.

## Taste

The sense of taste has the function of providing humans with information about whether foods are edible and digestible. In addition, the sense of taste reflexively activates the secretion of saliva and gastric juice. There are five taste qualities sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and “umami”. Umami is Japanese and means something like “savory, meaty, hearty”.

### Taste Sensors

The taste sensory cells are located in humans on the tongue, the soft palate, the pharynx, and the larynx. The cells are grouped together in taste buds. On the surface of the tongue, the taste buds are located in various taste papillae.

#### Taste buds

The taste buds are the carriers of the taste receptors.

| |Number|Number of contained taste buds|Localization|
|---|---|---|---|
|Fungiform papillae (Pilzpapillen)|- 150–400|- Each 2–4|- Anterior part of the tongue|
|Foliate papillae (Blätterpapillen)|- 15–30|- Each 50–100|- Back side edge of the tongue|
|Foliate papillae (Foliate papillae)|- 7–15|- Each >100|- Border to the lingual root (V-shaped arrangement)|
|Filiform papillae (Fadenpapillen)|- Cover the remaining surface of the tongue, but do not have taste buds and are only responsible for the sense of touch|   |   |

#### Taste buds

- Amount: Approximately 2000–5000
- Location: In the soft palate, pharynx and larynx as well as embedded in the taste buds on the tongue
- Construction
    - Have a pore through which the taste substances dissolved in saliva enter
    - Contain three different cell types:
        1. Taste sensory cells: Secondary sensory cells
            - Lifespan: About 7–10 days
            - Number: One taste bud contains 10–50 taste receptor cells
            - Structure: Possess microvilli that protrude into the pore and absorb flavor substances.
            - Perception of taste qualities: There are specialists and generalists among the taste sensory cells
                - Specialists: Are only aroused by a taste quality
                - Generalists: React to multiple taste qualities
        2. Basal cells: Capable of division; constantly form new taste sensory cells
        3. Support cells: Epithelial cells that have a supporting function for the tissue.
    - All taste buds contain cells for all five taste qualities!
- Afferent nerve fibers
    - Anterior ⅔ of the tongue and palate: Chorda tympani from N. facialis
    - Zungengrund: N. glossopharyngeus
    - Pharynx and Larynx: N. vagus

> [!NOTE]
> There is no specific topographical distribution on the tongue for the different taste qualities! There are only areas with a higher density of taste receptors, which is why the perception of taste is generally stronger there. Only the perception of bitter substances is slightly higher at the back of the tongue than in other areas. However, in principle, any taste quality can be perceived at any point on the tongue!

### Taste Qualities and Taste Recognition

There are five different taste qualities that activate the taste sensory cells through specific receptor molecules. Additionally, as with smelling, two thresholds are distinguished.

- Detection threshold: The concentration at which a substance can be tasted but not yet recognized.
- Detection threshold: The concentration at which the tasted substance can be identified.

| Taste Qualities |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

> [!NOTE]
> Bitter substances have the lowest detection threshold (0.001–1 mmol/L), as they are often toxic and therefore should trigger an early warning signal. A strong bitter taste triggers the gag reflex and is meant to protect against poisoning!

> [!NOTE]
> A taste quality arises from the responses of several taste fibers (so-called "across-the-fibre-pattern")!

> [!NOTE]
> The sensation of "sharp" is not a taste quality, but is perceived through the substance capsaicin via the trigeminal nerve (V)!

#### Signal forwarding

1. Depolarization of the taste sensory cell (through the mechanisms mentioned in the table)
2. Opening of voltage-dependent cellular Ca2+ channels in the taste sensory cell
3. Ca2+ flows into the cell
4. Fusion of the transmitter vesicles with the presynaptic membrane
5. Release of the transmitter from the sensory cell

#### Adaptation

- Despite the continued presence of taste molecules, there is an habituation of the sensory cell, leading to an increase in the detection threshold.
- Adaptation begins within seconds and can last for hours.
- The molecular mechanism is still unclear.

### Flavor Track

- 1. Neuron
    - The 1st neuron of the taste pathway is located in the ganglia of the three involved cranial nerves
        - Facial nerve: Geniculate ganglion
        - Glossopharyngeal nerve: Inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve
        - Vagus nerve: Inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve
    - The afferent taste fibers converge in the solitary tract in the brainstem
        - Tractus solitarius: Projects to the nucleus tractus solitarii in the medulla oblongata (there it synapses with the 2nd neuron)
- 2. Neuron
    - In the nucleus of the solitary tract: branching of fibers into three strands, which then project to three different brain areas.
        - Projection to the hypothalamus and to the amygdala
        - To the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus
- 3. Neuron: In the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus → Relay to the primary gustatory cortex at the base of the postcentral gyrus (anterior insula and frontal operculum) for conscious taste perception

> [!NOTE]
> Since foods and beverages release substances in the oral cavity that reach the olfactory mucosa retronasally, the "taste impression" is also largely conveyed by the sense of smell. Everyone has experienced this fact during a severe cold. Some subjective "taste disturbances" actually have their origin in the olfactory organ!

> [!NOTE] Hypogeusia, Ageusia, and Dysgeusia
> Various disturbances of taste perception can occur.  
> When there is a reduction in the sensitivity of taste perception, it is referred to as hypogeusia, and when there is a complete loss of taste, it is called ageusia.  
> Causes can include medications, chemotherapy, or even infections.  
> As the number of taste buds decreases with age, physiological hypogeusia can occur.  
> Dysgeusia refers to the occurrence of unpleasant taste sensations without any stimulus for them.  
> This is likely triggered by nonspecific excitation or by central disturbances.

## Trigeminal Sense

In the nasal mucosa, in addition to the olfactory sensory cells, free nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve can also be found. On one hand, these are responsible for nociception (pain perception), and on the other hand, they also react to certain odor substances that are not perceived through the olfactory system. These substances are called trigeminal irritants. Likewise, the perception of "sharp" is further transmitted by trigeminal nociceptors.

- Trigeminal irritants: e.g. chlorine, ammonia, acetic acid, sal ammoniac, formalin, capsaicin
- Trigeminal irritants trigger protective reflexes (e.g. saliva secretion, sneeze reflex, gag reflex)

> [!NOTE]
> Some substances, such as eucalyptus oil or butyric acid, irritate both the trigeminal and the olfactory system!

> [!NOTE] Odor test
> During the odor test, aromatic substances such as vanilla or coffee (which are only perceived through the N. olfactorius) are presented to the patient separately with their eyes closed. The patient is to indicate whether they can perceive these scents. To rule out the possibility that the patient is merely pretending not to be able to smell these substances, they are also given trigeminal irritants (e.g. ammonia, formalin). These substances are perceived due to trigeminal pathways even in cases of complete anosmia. However, it should be noted that in the case of lesions of the nasal mucosa, neither odor substances nor trigeminal irritants can be perceived.

## Reflexes

The chemical senses of humans trigger not only the sensations of taste and smell but also various reflexes.

- Gustofacial Reflex: Triggerable even in newborns
    - Sensation: Sweet, sour and bitter taste qualities
    - Reaction: Reflexive influence on facial expression
- Secretory reflexes
    - Stimulus: Sensation of smell and taste, trigeminal irritation
    - Reaction: Triggering of saliva and gastric juice secretion (cephalic phase)
- Niesreflex
    - Stimulus: Irritation of the free nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve in the nose by trigeminal irritants
    - Reaction: Sneezing
- Gag reflex
    - Stimulus: Strong bitter substances, trigeminal irritation in the mouth
    - Reaction: Gagging
## Review Questions on the Chapter Olfactory and Gustatory System
### Smell

Through which receptors does smell perception occur? How specific are these?
- Odorant receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that sit in the ciliary membrane of the olfactory sensory cells. There are about 1,000 different genes for odorant receptors; however, during evolution, the expression of 65% of these genes (so-called pseudogenes) has been lost. Since one receptor type can bind to different substances, we can still distinguish several thousand odorants despite this.

Describe the process of olfactory perception!
- When an odorant binds to the odorant receptor, a G-protein is activated. An adenylate cyclase then synthesizes cAMP from ATP, which binds to the so-called CNG channels (cAMP-gated ion channels): Na+ and Ca2+ flow in, causing the cell to depolarize. The potentials are transmitted via the axons of the olfactory nerve (N. olfactorius) to the olfactory bulb.

What is meant by adaptation of the olfactory receptors? What happens at the cellular level during this process?
- Adaptation describes the habituation effect of the odor receptors to a certain odorant after a period of time (by the way: taste cells also adapt). The calcium influx accompanying activation binds to calmodulin (calcium-calmodulin complex). This complex reduces the cAMP sensitivity of the CNG channels and at the same time increases the breakdown of cAMP. That means the CNG channels close and the cell becomes less excitable.

Describe the course of the olfactory pathway!
- The first neuron of the olfactory sensory cells is the olfactory cell itself (primary sensory cells). Their axons bundle into the Fila olfactoria, which pass through the cribriform plate and form the olfactory nerve (N. olfactorius). The relay to the second neuron occurs in the olfactory bulb, where several neurons with the same odorant selectivity unite and continue as the olfactory tract (Tractus olfactorius). This divides at the olfactory trigone into the lateral olfactory stria, which projects into the amygdala, the prepiriform, and entorhinal cortex, and into the medial olfactory stria with projection targets the olfactory tubercle and septal area.

### Taste

Which nerves are responsible for the afferent transmission of taste on the tongue?
- The anterior two-thirds of the tongue and the palate are supplied by the chorda tympani (facial nerve, N. facialis), the base of the tongue by the glossopharyngeal nerve (N. glossopharyngeus), and the larynx as well as the pharynx by the vagus nerve (N. vagus).

How is the taste "sweet" triggered and perceived? What other taste qualities are conveyed through the same receptor principle?
- Carbohydrates and some proteins trigger the perception of the "sweet" taste. They lead to indirect depolarization via G-protein-coupled receptors, which relay the taste perception using various secondary messengers (IP3, cAMP, Ca2+). The same principle also applies to the taste qualities "bitter" and "umami."

Describe the course of the taste pathway!
- The fibers activated by a taste (first neuron) first run through the following ganglia: facial nerve → geniculate ganglion; glossopharyngeal nerve → inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve; vagus nerve → inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve. They all then collect in the solitary tract (Tractus solitarius) and proceed to the nucleus of the solitary tract (Ncl. tractus solitarii) in the medulla oblongata, where they switch to the second neuron. Here they split up: one part goes to the amygdala and hypothalamus, the other to the ventral posteromedial nucleus (Ncl. ventralis posteromedialis) of the thalamus, where the switch to the third neuron takes place. This runs to the primary gustatory cortex at the base of the postcentral gyrus (anterior insular cortex and frontal operculum), where conscious taste perception occurs.

### Trigeminal Sense

What kind of "olfactory perception" occurs through the trigeminal nerve? What substances trigger this, among others?
- In the nasal mucosa, in addition to the olfactory sensory cells, free nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve are also found. These are responsible on the one hand for nociception (pain perception), and on the other hand they also react to certain odorants that are not perceived by the olfactory system. These substances are called trigeminal irritants. These include, for example, chlorine, ammonia, ammonium chloride, acetic acid, formalin. Capsaicin (the taste quality "spicy") is also perceived through the trigeminal nerve. These stimuli trigger protective reflexes such as sneezing and salivation.
