# Basics of Sensor Technology
## Summary

In sensory physiology, stimuli are perceived by peripheral sensors and then transmitted to the central nervous system. Depending on the sensor, different sensory modalities are distinguished. The most important sensory modalities include seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling. The reception and transmission of stimuli for each sensory modality can be divided into a two-stage process, consisting of the so-called transduction and transformation. In the context of transduction, the physical stimulus is first converted into an electrical receptor potential and subsequently, during transformation, transmitted in the form of an electrical signal to the central nervous system.
## Overview of the Sensory Modalities

As a sensory modality, one refers to the sensations perceived by a sensory organ. There are five modalities: hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling (which includes the sense of touch, pain, and temperature). Within a sensory modality, different qualities are distinguished.

|Sense modality|   |Sense quality|
|---|---|---|
|- Seeing (Visual System)|   |- Brightness, Colors|
|- Hearing (Auditory System)|   |- Tone frequency, Volume|
|- Smell (Olfactory System)|   |- Scents|
|- Taste (Gustatory System)|   |- Flavor Profiles|
|- Touch and Feel (Tactile System)|- Sense of Touch|- Pressure<br>- Touch<br>- Vibration|
|- Pain Sensation|- Pain Character<br>    - Sharp<br>    - Dull<br>    - Burning|
|- Temperature Sense|- Heat Sensation<br>- Cold Sensation|
## Acquisition and Forwarding of Stimuli

The reception and transmission of stimuli occurs in a two-stage process. First, the physical stimuli are perceived by the sensors and converted into an so-called electrical receptor potential. This process is referred to as transduction. If the receptor potential exceeds a threshold, action potentials are triggered as part of the so-called transformation, which are then transmitted to the central nervous system. The conscious perception of these signals occurs only after processing by the CNS.

### Overview of Stimulus Reception

1. Stimulus acts on the receptor of the sensory cell.
2. Transduction: Sensory cell generates the so-called receptor potential
3. Transformation: Action potential sequence is generated by:
    1. Sog. primary sensory cell or
    2. Neuron (which follows a so-called secondary sensory cell)

### Transduction (Sensory)

The perceived stimulus can be mechanical, electromagnetic, chemical, or thermal. Depending on the perceived modality, the sensors have different mechanisms to convert the perceived stimulus into a so-called receptor potential.

- Process of Transduction
    1. Excitation recording via the sensor
    2. Stimulus is converted into a receptor potential
- Characteristics of the receptor potential
    - Is the stimulus analogous in duration and amplitude?
    - Spreads passively from the site of origin in the receptor cell (= passive electrotonic conduction)
- Examples
    - Sensory modality: Hearing
        - Sensors: Hair cells
        - Transduction process in the hair cells: Mechanical shear movement of the sensory hair cells is converted into a receptor potential
    - Sensory modality: Vision
        - Sensors: Photoreceptors
        - Transduction process: Light, which is electromagnetic waves, is converted into a receptor potential

### Transformation (Sensorik)

As part of the transformation, the receptor potential is converted into action potentials. The mechanisms responsible for this process are explained in the context of the generation of action potentials. The resulting action potentials are then transmitted to the central nervous system via afferent nerve fibers (usually through saltatory conduction).

- Process of Transformation
    1. Receptor potential spreads electrotonically
    2. When the threshold of adjacent voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ channels is exceeded, an action potential (according to the all-or-nothing response) is triggered.
    3. Transmission of the action potential via the afferent nerve to the CNS
- Characteristics of the transformation
    - The amplitude of the receptor potentials is encoded by the frequency of the action potentials
    - Action potentials then occur after the all-or-nothing reaction

> [!NOTE]
> Reencoding of sensory information: The stronger the stimulus, the greater the receptor potential and the higher the frequency of action potentials!

> [!NOTE]
> The receptor potential spreads electrotonically, meaning that the conduction occurs passively and diminishes with increasing distance from the site of origin. Action potentials, on the other hand, follow the so-called “all-or-nothing response”!

### Sensory Cells

Fundamentally, there are two types of sensors. It is distinguished whether sensory cells can independently generate action potentials or not. Primary sensory cells can generate both receptor potentials and action potentials. Secondary sensory cells are only capable of generating the receptor potential.

- Primary sensory cell: Sensory cell with its own axon
    - Performs both transduction and transformation
    - Example: Olfactory sensory cells
- Secondary sensory cell: Sensory cell without its own axon
    - Performs only the transduction
    - Example: Taste sensory cells

### Organization of Sensory Channels

### Sensor Types

Both primary and secondary sensory cells are classified based on their respective measurement behavior. In principle, a distinction is made between proportional sensors and differential sensors. The former register the strength of a stimulus; the latter primarily measure how much a stimulus changes. The sensory cells of each sensory modality can thus be assigned to a type of sensor.

| |Message Behavior|Receptor Type|Adaptation Behavior|Examples|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Proportional sensors|- Directly proportional to stimulus strength|- SA sensors|- Not present or only very slow → SA sensors|- SA-I sensors: Merkel cells<br>- SA-II sensors: Ruffini corpuscles|
|Differential sensors|- Register the speed at which a stimulus changes|- RA sensors|- Rapid adaptation to the stimulus → RA sensors<br>    - The fastest adaptation is shown by RA-II sensors (= PC sensors)|- RA-I sensors: Meissner's corpuscles<br>- RA-II sensors (= PC sensors): Pacinian corpuscles|
|Proportional-Differential Sensor|- Registers both the intensity of the stimulus and the rate at which a stimulus changes|- PD Sensors|- Average adaptation behavior|- Muscle spindles|

### Receptive Fields

The area that activates only a single sensory cell is referred to as a receptive field. The afferent nerve fibers that transmit the information from this area to the CNS can be connected to either one or multiple sensory cells. If a central neuron receives information this way from many afferent nerve fibers, it is considered a large receptive field; the exact location of the stimulus is difficult for the neuron to localize here. Therefore, the size of the receptive fields determines the spatial resolution of a sensory cell.

- Large receptive fields
    - Resolution: Low
    - Principle: Many afferent fibers reach a central neuron → Neuron cannot distinguish where the stimulus occurred in the receptive field → Poor resolution
- Small receptive fields
    - Resolution: High
    - Principle: Only a few peripheral neurons reach a central neuron → Good differentiation capability for the central neuron → Good resolution capacity
## Review Questions on the Chapter Fundamentals of Sensor Technology
### Organization of Sensory Channels

What types of sensors are there and what measurement characteristics distinguish each of them?
- Sensory cells can be classified based on their measurement behavior: Proportional sensors register the strength of a stimulus, differential sensors the speed at which a stimulus changes. Accordingly, proportional-differential sensors can register both the stimulus strength and the speed at which a stimulus changes.
What adaptation behaviors do the different sensor types exhibit?
- Proportional sensors do not adapt or adapt very slowly, which is why they are referred to as SA sensors (SA = slowly adapting). Differential sensors can adapt quickly to the stimulus (RA sensors, RA = rapidly adapting), proportional-differential sensors have an intermediate adaptation behavior.
