# Vagina and Vulva

## Summary

The vagina is one of the internal female reproductive organs and is part of the birth canal. It is tubular and approximately 10 cm long. The external female genitalia is referred to as the vulva and includes, among other things, the clitoris as well as the outer and inner labia.
## Macroscopic Anatomy of the Vagina

### Profile

- Function: Copulatory organ, birth canal, outlet of menstrual blood, protection against ascending infections
- Location: Subperitoneal in the paracolic area
- Form
    - Tubular
    - Opening of the uterus as the vaginal portion of the cervix into the proximal anterior wall
    - The front and back walls are compressed by the neighboring organs.
- Size: Approximately 8–10 cm long

### Structure

The vagina has a vaginal vault (fornix vaginae), in which the portio vaginalis cervicis is embedded. The vaginal wall is compressed by neighboring organs, causing the anterior and posterior walls to touch each other. The vaginal opening is usually framed by the hymen in the area of the vestibulum vaginae. The vagina is divided into:

- Fornix of the vagina (Vaginal vault)
    - Lateral paries (lateral vaginal arch): Lateral to each portio
    - Posterior pouch (posterior vaginal fornix): Extends further cranially than the anterior part and is adjacent to the cervix.
    - Anterior fornix (anterior vaginal vault): Opening of the evaginated portio
- Vaginal wall
    - Anterior wall (front wall)
    - Posterior wall (back wall)
- Ostium vaginae (Vaginal opening)
    - Hymen: Encloses the vaginal opening in a variable form.

> [!NOTE]
> The Latin terms can be easily confused at this point: "Pars" = part and "Paries" = wall!

> [!NOTE]
> The hymen is a mucous membrane fold of variable shape (e.g., round or crescent-shaped) at the boundary between the inner and outer female genitalia - physiologically, it does not completely close the vaginal canal and does not tear during first intercourse!

> [!NOTE] Hymenal atresia
> With a complete closure of the vaginal canal by the hymen, it can lead to the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina and uterus from the onset of menarche. The girls present with primary amenorrhea and a palpable lower abdominal tumor (blood-filled uterus).

### Topography

- Location: Subperitoneal, embedded in the paracolpium
- Location relationships
    - Ventral: Urethra and bladder
    - Dorsal: Rectum (separated by the rectovaginal fascia)
    - Lateral: Ureters run laterally to the vaginal arch
    - Cranial: Parametrial Support Apparatus, Douglas Space
    - Distal: Pelvic diaphragm and vulva

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Vaginal branches of the uterine artery from the internal iliac artery<br>- Vaginal branches of the inferior vesical artery, middle rectal artery, and distal from the internal pudendal artery|
|Venous|- Vaginal and uterine venous plexus in uterine veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Sensory|- N. pudendus|
|Sympathetic|- Uterovaginal plexus of the inferior hypogastric plexus|
|Parasympathetic|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Paravaginal nodes in internal iliac nodes<br>- Superficial inguinal nodes in external iliac nodes|

> [!NOTE] Transvaginal Operations
> In the area of the fornix, there is only a relatively sparse sensory innervation. This will be utilized in transvaginal surgeries of intraperitoneal organs (e.g. transvaginal cholecystectomy). Additionally, the vaginal mucosa typically heals quickly and without complications.

## Microscopic Anatomy of the Vagina

### Histological Structure of the Vagina

|Wall Layers|Description|
|---|---|
|Mucous membrane|- Vaginal rugae: Characteristic transverse folds of the vaginal mucosa, serve as a reserve for stretching, e.g., during childbirth<br>    - Anterior or posterior column of rugae: Totality of the vaginal rugae in the anterior or posterior wall<br>    - Urethral carina of the vagina: Distal bulge of the urethra in continuation of the anterior column of rugae<br>- Epithelium: Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which is free of glands and rich in glycogen<br>    1. Superficial stratum: Highest epithelial differentiation, high glycogen content<br>    2. Intermediate stratum: Intermediate level of differentiation<br>    3. Parabasal stratum: Beginning of differentiation<br>    4. Basal stratum: Regeneration layer<br>- Lamina propria: Numerous vessels and elastic fibers|
|Tunica muscularis|- Thin muscle layer with numerous elastic connective tissue fibers<br>    - Inner layer: Circular muscle<br>    - Outer layer: Longitudinal muscle|
|Tunica adventitia|- Surrounding connective tissue with elastic fibers, vessels, and nerves|

> [!NOTE]
> The mucous membrane of the vagina has no glands! Strictly speaking, the vaginal epithelium is therefore not a mucous membrane. During sexual stimulation, the vagina becomes more vascularized and a transudate is formed, which provides adequate lubrication during copulation!

### Cyclical Mucosal Changes of the Vagina and Vaginal Portion of the Cervix

Similar to the endometrium of the uterus, the multilayered non-keratinized squamous epithelium of the vagina and the vaginal portion of the cervix undergoes cyclical changes:

- Preovulatory
    - Strong estrogen influence: Stimulation for the differentiation of the epithelium (highly developed, four-layered epithelium)
    - Highest glycogen content of the epithelium at the time of ovulation
- Postovulatory
    - Lower estrogen levels: Shedding of the outermost epithelial layer (stratum superficiale)

> [!NOTE] Vaginal swab
> The cycle-dependent changes of the mucosa are clearly visible in the vaginal smear. A cytological smear is taken from the proximal posterior wall of the vagina and placed on a slide. After staining (according to Papanicolaou), the preparation can provide insight into the cycle phase under the microscope. Before and during ovulation, primarily acidophilic (red) cells are visible. Postovulatory, however, immature cells with basophilic cytoplasm dominate.

## Function of the Vagina

The vagina is not only the primary sexual organ of the woman, it also allows for the passage of the child during birth due to its strong elasticity. A special bacterial environment protects the woman from ascending infections.

1. Copulatory organ
2. Derivation of menstrual blood
3. Protection against ascending infections
    - Vaginal environment: Strongly acidic with a pH of 4-4.5
        - Scaly squamous epithelial cells contain glycogen
        - Conversion of glycogen to lactic acid by Döderlein bacteria
        - Acidic environments hinder colonization by pathogenic foreign germs
    - Döderlein bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, lactic acid bacteria): Gram-positive, non-motile rods
        - Function: Maintenance of the acidic vaginal environment
4. Birth canal during childbirth of a child
    - Strong elasticity of the muscularis tunic and mucous membrane due to vaginal rugae
    - Contraction of the muscles and reduction of stretching after birth
## Vulva

The external genitalia of the woman is also called the vulva. This includes the vaginal vestibule (= vestibulum vaginae) with the vaginal opening (= ostium vaginae). This is surrounded by the inner and outer labia (= labia minora and majora). The clitoris has numerous sensitive nerve endings and plays an important role in the sexual arousal of the woman. The accessory sexual glands of the woman will also be discussed below.

### Anatomy of the Vulva

The vulva refers to the area of the vaginal opening and includes the following structures:

> [!NOTE] Bartholinitis
> An infection of a Bartholin gland can be very painful for a woman. Often, it leads to an inflammatory blockage of the duct. In marsupialization (from Latin marsupium = "pouch"), the duct is surgically opened, the edges are folded outward and fixed to create an open pouch.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Vagina and Vulva
### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Vagina

What structures are adjacent to the vagina?
- Ventral to the vagina lie the urethra and urinary bladder, dorsal the rectum (separated by the rectovaginal fascia). The ureters run lateral to the vaginal vault. Cranial to the vagina are the parametrium support structure, the uterus, and the Douglas pouch, distally finally the pelvic diaphragm (pelvic floor) and the vulva.
What is referred to as hymenal atresia and how is it clinically noticeable?
- Normally the hymen does not completely close the vaginal canal. In complete closure of the vaginal canal by the hymen (hymenal atresia), starting at menarche, there may be an accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina and uterus. The affected girls present with primary amenorrhea and possibly a palpable lower abdominal tumor (blood-filled uterus).
### Microscopic Anatomy of the Vagina

How is the vagina histologically structured?
- The wall of the vagina is three-layered and bears characteristic transverse folds (rugae vaginales). It consists of tunica mucosa, tunica muscularis (thin muscle layer with many elastic connective tissue fibers, outer longitudinal, inner circular muscle), and tunica adventitia (surrounding connective tissue with elastic fibers, vessels, and nerves).
How is the tunica mucosa of the vagina typically structured?
- The tunica mucosa of the vagina consists of multilayered non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which is free of glands and rich in glycogen.
### Vulva

Where do the excretory ducts of the major vestibular glands empty?
- The excretory ducts of the glandulae vestibulares majores (Bartholin's glands) open on the inner side of the inner labia (labia minora) and thus into the vaginal vestibule (vestibulum vaginae).
