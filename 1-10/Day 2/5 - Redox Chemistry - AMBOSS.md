# Redox Chemistry
## Summary

The term "redox" chemistry is composed of the abbreviations for reduction and oxidation. These are chemical processes in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to another. The substances involved are either reduced (when they gain electrons) or oxidized (when they lose electrons). Since, strictly speaking, all reactions are either redox reactions or acid-base reactions (for an explanation of acid-base reactions see the chapter on acid-base balance), redox chemistry is of extraordinary importance. To make it easier to describe redox processes, chemists have come up with the auxiliary construct of oxidation numbers, which is explained in detail here.

In addition to the classical chemical redox processes, the most important biological redox systems are also presented. These also take on the task of transferring electrons in the human body and are necessary for all metabolic functions.

Since redox processes are based on the transfer of electrons, there is a natural connection to the study of electricity. The overlapping area is referred to as electrochemistry. By spatially separating the reduction and oxidation processes, a flow of current can be generated in so-called galvanic elements or cells. This fundamental principle also underlies the operation of batteries. In the medical context, electrochemistry is particularly important because it enables the understanding of impulse conduction in the body (see also Chapter on Resting and Action Potential).

## Oxidation States

Reduction and oxidation processes cannot always be easily deduced from the charge of the involved particles. To specify as accurately as possible which elements are oxidized and which are reduced in redox reactions, as well as how many electrons are transferred, one makes use of the formalism of oxidation numbers.

- Definition: Number of elementary charges that are formally attributed to an atom or a group of atoms in a compound.
- Nomenclature: Roman numerals with a preceding sign are placed in parentheses after the atom or group, e.g. Fe(+III)2O3
- Determination of the oxidation state
    - Monatomic particles
        - Elements: Oxidation state always = 0
        - Ions: Oxidation state = Charge of the ions
    - Multi-atomic particles
        1. Recording the Lewis structure formula including all lone electron pairs. For details on the Lewis structure formula, see Chapter: Structure of Matter
        2. All connections are considered individually:
            1. Formally, both bonding electrons are attributed to the more electronegative bonding partner. For details on electronegativity, see Chapter: Structure of Matter
            2. When both bonding partners are equal, each partner is assigned one bonding electron.
        3. Formal charge = Oxidation state
        4. Verification: The sum of all oxidation numbers must equal the actual charge of the particle.

Elements consistently exhibit the same oxidation states in their compounds. Therefore, the most important oxidation states will be presented below with examples:

|Element|Important Oxidation State|Example|
|---|---|---|
|H|+ I|in all fast connections, e.g., H2O|
|C|-IV|CH4|
|-III|Propene: C(-III)H3-C(-I)H=C(-II)H2|
|-II|
|-I|
|+I|Aldehyde functional group CHO|
|+III|Carboxylic acid function COOH|
|+IV|CO2|
|O|-II|in almost all connections, e.g. H2O|
|-I|H2O2|
|S|+IV|SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)|
|+VI|H2SO4|
|N|-III|NH3|
|+V|HNO3|
|P|+V|H3PO4|
|F, Cl, Br, I|-I|Salts, e.g. NaCl|
|Na, K|+I|Salts, e.g. NaCl|
|Mg, Ca|+II|Salts, e.g. MgCl2|

> [!note]
> Oxidation numbers were invented by chemists to effectively represent redox processes on paper. They are NOT actual charges; oxidation numbers are therefore not "real" properties of the particles in this sense!

## Redox Reactions

The most important definitions regarding redox reactions are summarized as follows:

### Reduction

- Definition: Capture of electrons
- Example: Cu2+ + 2 e- → Cu0
- Oxidation state: Decreases (or becomes more negative) when a substance is reduced.
- Reducing agent: A substance that reduces other substances while being oxidized itself.

### Oxidation

- Definition: Emission of electrons
- Example: Fe0 → Fe3+ + 3 e-
- Oxidation state: Increases when a substance is oxidized.
- Oxidizing agent: A substance that oxidizes other substances while being reduced itself.

### Overall Reaction

- Definition: Consists of the half-reactions of reduction and oxidation.
- Oxidation states: The oxidation states of the reduced substances must decrease to the same extent as the oxidation states of the oxidized substances increase; or in other words: The number of electrons taken up and released must be equal.
- Redox pair: The oxidized and reduced form of a particle, e.g., Cu/Cu2+
- Further to consider: Charge balance and mass balance
- Example
    1. Reduction: Cu2+ + 2 e- → Cu0
    2. Oxidation: Fe0 → Fe3+ + 3 e-
    3. Redox reaction (after balancing charge and mass): 3 Cu2+ + 2 Fe0 → 3 Cu0 + 2 Fe3+

### Acid-Base Definition according to Lewis

- Lewis acid: Compounds that can accept electrons (are "electrophilic"), e.g.
    - (Metal) cations
    - Molecules with partially positive polarization (e.g. CO2)
    - Electron-deficient compounds
- Lewis Base: Compounds that can donate electrons (are "nucleophilic"), e.g.
    - Anions
    - Molecules with lone pairs of electrons (e.g. NH3)

### Special Cases

- Disproportionation
    - Definition: A redox reaction in which an element of a certain oxidation state reacts in a reaction to form two new species with different oxidation states.
    - Example: Cl2(0) + H2O → HCl(+I)O + HCl(-I)
- Compensatory proportionalization
    - Definition: A redox reaction in which a new species is formed from an element that exists in two different oxidation states, where this element now has the same oxidation number.
    - Example: H2S(+VI)O4 + 3 H2S(-II) → 4 S(0) + 4 H2O

> [!note]
> To better remember the names of the reacting substances, the word "Oxford" is helpful, because during oxidation, an electron is "released"!

## Important Biochemical Redox Pairs

In biology, some important redox pairs occur that are usually involved in electron transfer processes in the body or, like the cystine/cysteine pair, have a structural function. Some biochemically important redox pairs will be introduced here:

## Fundamentals of Electrochemistry

### Electrochemical Reactions

A redox reaction in which the reducing or oxidizing agent is not a chemical compound but an electrode is called an electrochemical redox reaction or simply an electrochemical reaction. The simplest electrochemical arrangement is the direct contact between two substances with different redox potentials, as encountered in everyday life, for example, in corrosion protection.

- Local element: Electrochemical arrangement that arises from direct contact between reducing and oxidizing material (in the presence of water) and results in a redox reaction between the substances.
    - Example: A steel nail wrapped with copper wire, lying in water
- Corrosion protection: To prevent the corrosion of iron (= rusting), it is often industrially coated with a metal layer.
    - Zinc layer: Zinc is more easily oxidized than iron. Therefore, when the protective layer is damaged, zinc is oxidized (it goes into solution as Zn2+) and the iron remains intact. This principle of corrosion protection is also called a sacrificial anode.
    - Tin layer: Tin is less easily oxidized than iron, but is still suitable as a protective layer. However, the disadvantage is that a once-damaged protective layer accelerates the oxidation of the underlying iron because a local element forms.

> [!note] Local element in the mouth
> Since local elements can also develop well in the moist environment of the mouth, gold and amalgam fillings should be spatially far apart or better yet, not present at the same time, to prevent any redox reaction from starting. This is because amalgam is a metal mixture that always contains mercury. Mercury is oxidized much more easily than gold. During this process, mercury ions dissolve and enter the body through saliva, where they can lead to poisoning.

### The electrochemical cell

As an electrochemical cell, we refer to electrochemical arrangements with a specific structure (see below) in which redox reactions occur spontaneously (galvanic cell), are forced (electrolysis cell), or energy is stored chemically (accumulators). The reduction process and the oxidation process (i.e., the two "half-reactions") are spatially separated within the electrochemical cell.

#### General Structure

- Oxidation half-cell: Half-cell in which oxidation occurs, also called anode.
- Reduction half-cell: Half-cell in which the reduction takes place, also called cathode.
- In the experiment: e.g. two beakers (= half-cells), each with different metal electrodes and electrolyte solutions.
    - Electrode
        - The electrochemical reaction takes place on the surface of the electrode.
        - Electrodes are electrically connected to each other.
            - Charging process: Positive terminal = Anode, Negative terminal = Cathode
            - Discharge process: Positive terminal = Cathode, Negative terminal = Anode
    - Electrolyte: Salt solution made of anions and cations
        - Anions
            - Charge balance during the reaction
            - Typically equal in both half-cells
            - Move between the two half-cells (through a semipermeable membrane or a salt bridge)
            - Are not involved in the electrochemical reaction!
        - Cations
            - Products or reactants of the electrochemical reaction
            - Usually different in both half-cells
            - Can only move within one of the two half-cells

> [!note]
> Charging process of an electrochemical cell: OPA = Oxidation, positive pole, anode; Discharging process of an electrochemical cell: OMA = Oxidation, negative pole, anode.

#### Galvanic Elements

- Galvanic cell: Electrochemical cell in which a reaction occurs "spontaneously," i.e., according to the standard potentials of the reactants.
    - Example reaction: Zn + Cu2+ → Zn2+ + Cu
    - Meaning: Use as a direct current source, e.g. in the form of batteries
    - Abbreviated form: e.g., zinc/copper cell (also called Daniell cell)
        - The two redox pairs are written with a separating vertical line to symbolize the phase boundary: e.g. Zn|Zn2+
        - The redox pair of the anode is written before the redox pair of the cathode.
        - To symbolize the separation of the two half-cells by an ion-permeable membrane, the half-cells are separated by a vertical double line: Anode || Cathode
        - The ionic form of both redox pairs is conventionally represented as: Zn|Zn2+ || Cu2+|Cu
    - Concentration cell: A voltage forms between two half-cells even when the electrodes are made of the same material and the electrolyte solutions have different concentrations.
        - Anode: Half-cell with the lower concentration
        - Cathode: Half-cell with the higher concentration

### The Electrochemical Series

An electrochemical cell contains two different electrodes, with the electrical voltage between the electrodes depending on the respective redox pair. To know what voltage exists in an electrochemical cell, the so-called voltage series was developed. In this series, the electrochemical potentials of the individual electrodes are listed in relation to a standard electrode. Using the electrochemical potentials of the individual electrons, the electromotive force of any cell can then be calculated.

- Electrochemical potential (E): Electrochemical voltage generated during the transformation of the components of a redox pair into each other.
- Electrochemical series: Order of all redox pairs sorted by their electrochemical potential and in comparison to a standard potential.
    - Reference value: Electrochemical standard potentials are stated in comparison to the so-called standard hydrogen electrode, whose potential has been arbitrarily set at E = 0.
    - Hydrogen electrode
        - Electrode reaction: 2 H+ + 2 e- → H2 or in aqueous solution: H2 + 2 H2O ⇄ 2 H3O+ + 2 e-
        - Physical conditions for the standard electrode: T = 298 K, p = 1013 hPa, c(H+) = 1 mol/L

| Fe/Fe2+                        | -0.40                               |
| H2/2H+                         | 0                                   |
| Cu/Cu2+                        | +0.34                               |
| Ag/Ag+                         | +0.80                               |
| H2O / ½ O2 + 2 H+              | +1.23                               |
| Cl-/ ½ Cl2                     | +1.36                               |

> [!note]
> The greater the electrochemical potential of a redox pair, the more "noble" its character. By adding a less noble metal to the aqueous solution of a more noble metal, the more noble metal precipitates out, while the less noble metal goes into solution!

#### The Nernst Equation

The electric voltage that arises between two redox pairs in an electrochemical reaction is called electromotive force. It helps to estimate whether a reaction occurs spontaneously or not. This can be calculated using the Nernst equation.

- Nernst equation: Describes the dependence of the potential of an electrochemical half-reaction on the concentration of ions in the electrolyte.
    - Formula: E = E0 + (RT/zF) ln(cOx/cRed); under standard conditions: E = E0 + (0.06V/z) log(cOx/cRed)
    - Unit: V
    - E = electrochemical potential, E0 = standard potential, R = gas constant, T = temperature, F = Faraday constant, z = number of transferred electrons, cOx = concentration of the oxidized form, cRed = concentration of the reduced form

- Electromotive Force: ETotal = ECathode - EAnode
    - Unit: V
    - E = Voltage
    - Important facts about electromotive force
        - Etotal > 0: the reaction occurs spontaneously
        - Etotal < 0: the reaction must be forced

##### Example Calculation

Calculate the electromotive force under standard conditions for the reaction 2 Na + Cu2+ → 2 Na+ + Cu for a concentration of c(Na+) = 0.1 mol/L and c(Cu2+) = 0.5 mol/L.

- Sought: Electromotive Force Etotal
- Given: Reaction equation, concentrations c
    - Separating the redox reaction into the two half-reactions: Na+ + e- → Na and Cu2+ + 2e- → Cu
    - Standard potentials of both reactions (from the electrochemical series (see above)): E0Na = -2.7 V; E0Cu = +0.4 V
    - Calculation of the Na half-cell voltage: ENa = -2.7 + (0.06/1) × log(0.1/1) => ENa ≈ -2.8 V and ECu = 0.4 + (0.06/2) × log(0.5/1) => ECu ≈ 0.4 V
    - The cell voltage is calculated as the difference E = EKathode-EAnode => E = 0.4 V + 2.8 V = 3.2 V

#### Electrolysis

- Electrolysis: Electrochemical reaction that occurs only when electrical work is applied (i.e., "current is supplied"), because it proceeds against the standard potentials of the reactants.
    - Electromotive Force: Etotal < 0
    - Example reaction: Fe2+ + Cu → Fe + Cu2+
    - Meaning: The electrolysis of water produces hydrogen and oxygen, which can be used as chemical energy storage and converted into electrical energy in the so-called fuel cell.

### Electrochemistry in Medicine

For medical professionals, electrochemical processes are particularly important for understanding the processes of signal transmission in nerve and muscle cells. Details on the various processes can be found in the chapters on resting and action potentials, electrical heart activity, and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, electrochemical gradients also play an important role in substance transport at the cellular level, which is described in more detail in the chapter on substance transport.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Redox Chemistry
### Oxidation States

Explain how to determine the oxidation numbers for the salt NaCl.
- Determining oxidation numbers in salts whose anions and cations consist of single atoms is simple: the oxidation number corresponds to the ion charge. For NaCl, this means the oxidation number of sodium is +1, and that of chloride is -1.

Explain how to determine the oxidation numbers in the water molecule.
- To determine the oxidation number of polyatomic compounds, one must first draw the molecular structure including all free electron pairs. Then, the bonding electrons are divided among the different bonding partners. The water molecule has two O-H bonds. Since the hydrogen atom is less electronegative than the oxygen atom, both bonding electrons are assigned to the oxygen atom. Then the electrons are counted: both hydrogen atoms have no electrons. Since, according to their position in the periodic table, they should have one, their formal charge is +1. The oxygen atom has 4 free electrons and all 4 bonding electrons, a total of 8. According to its position in the periodic table, an oxygen atom should only have 6 electrons, so its formal charge in the water molecule is -2. One can verify that these numbers are correct by calculating the sum of all formal charges/oxidation numbers: (+1) + (+1) + (-2) = 0. This must match the total charge of the water molecule.

### Redox Reactions

What is meant by the terms "oxidizing agent" and "reducing agent"? Provide examples for each.
- Quinones are redox systems that transfer two electrons and two protons. A quinone is initially reduced in a first step by the uptake of one electron and one proton to the so-called semiquinone (a radical since there is now one unpaired electron in the system). In a further reduction, the semiquinone then takes up another electron and proton and becomes the hydroquinone (an aromatic system substituted with two OH groups). Both reduction reactions are reversible. In these reverse reactions, the hydroquinone or semiquinone is oxidized.

What must be considered when balancing the chemical equation with regard to the oxidation states?
- Cysteine is a redox-active amino acid that is easily oxidized by the SH groups of the side chains of two amino acids joining via a so-called disulfide bond or S-S bridge. The resulting molecule is called cystine.

### Important Biochemical Redox Pairs

Describe the redox reactions that quinones undergo.
- Quinones are redox systems that transfer two electrons and two protons. A quinone is initially reduced in a first step by the uptake of one electron and one proton to the so-called semiquinone (a radical since there is now one unpaired electron in the system). In a further reduction, the semiquinone then takes up another electron and proton and becomes the hydroquinone (an aromatic system substituted with two OH groups). Both reduction reactions are reversible. In these reverse reactions, the hydroquinone or semiquinone is oxidized.

Which amino acid is part of an important redox system? And what is the name of the molecule that is its redox partner?
- Cysteine is a redox-active amino acid that is easily oxidized by the SH groups of the side chains of two amino acids joining via a so-called disulfide bond (or S-S bridge). The molecule formed is called cystine.

### Fundamentals of Electrochemistry

Which electrochemical reaction is typically used in aqueous solution as a standard reaction for comparing redox potentials?
- The standard electrode for electrochemistry in aqueous solution is the so-called normal hydrogen electrode. At this electrode, hydrogen is oxidized: H2 + 2 H2O ⇄ 2 H3O+ + 2 e-.

What is calculated using the Nernst equation? And what are the two variants of the equation?
- The Nernst equation describes the voltage between a "noble" reduction half-cell and a "base" oxidation half-cell. For this, the standard potential of the electrode material is combined with a product formed from two quotients. The first quotient is a more or less constant prefactor, into which only in the denominator the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction is entered. The second quotient is logarithmized and consists of the ion concentrations of oxidation cell and reduction cell (E = E0 + (RT/zF) ln(cOx/cRed)). If the system does not consist of different elements but the same element in different concentrations, the concentration of the reduction half-cell is taken as the cell with the higher concentration, and as the oxidation half-cell the cell with the lower concentration.
