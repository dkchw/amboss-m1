# Pituitary Gland
## Summary

The pituitary gland is responsible for the secretion of a number of important hormones that act partly at the target organ itself and partly as regulatory hormones in feedback loops. Through its regulatory hormones, it influences the production of thyroid and sex hormones, among others. The pituitary gland is also called the brain's appendage, as it is connected to the hypothalamus via the pituitary stalk. The pituitary gland has particular clinical relevance in the context of various diseases, as hormone-producing tumors can develop from its cells, for example. For instance, tumors can arise from growth hormone-producing cells, leading to gigantism. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on the pituitary gland as part of the episode on the endocrine organs in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the pituitary gland.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Synonym: Pituitary gland
- Function: Production and secretion of various hormones
- Location: Sella turcica above the sphenoid sinus
- Form: Round
- Size: 13 mm × 9 mm × 6 mm
- Weight: 0.6 g

### Structure

The pituitary gland is functionally, histologically, and developmentally divided into:

- Adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary + intermediate lobe of the pituitary): Makes up the majority of the pituitary gland.
    - Hormone production and secretion
    - Middle lobe: Rudimentarily developed, limited endocrine function
- Neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary + infundibulum): part of the diencephalon
    - Secretion of hormones produced in the hypothalamus

> [!NOTE]
> The adenohypophysis is an endocrine gland. The neurohypophysis is part of the diencephalon!

### Topography

The pituitary gland is located intracranially on the sphenoid bone. It is connected upward through the infundibulum to the diencephalon (a part of the brain), which is why it is also referred to as the "hypophysis."

- Location: Hypophyseal fossa in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone
- Topographical relationship to the pituitary gland
    - Cranial: Connected to the hypothalamus via the pituitary stalk (infundibulum)
    - Lateral: Surrounded on both sides by the cavernous sinus
    - Caudal: Sphenoid sinus (used as an access route in surgeries, for example)
    - Rostral: Optic chiasm

> [!NOTE] Blind spot field
> In the optic chiasm, the fibers of the optic nerve that supply the nasal half of the retina cross and thus represent the temporal visual field. If tumors develop in the pituitary gland (e.g., a prolactinoma), they can press on the optic chiasm and lead to the loss of the crossing fibers. The temporal visual fields can then no longer be perceived (so-called bitemporal hemianopsia).

### Vascular Supply

While the neurohypophysis is supplied with blood by the inferior hypophyseal artery, the adenohypophysis is accessed through so-called hypophyseal portal veins. These veins absorb the hypothalamic regulatory hormones in their first capillary bed at the infundibulum and transport them to a second capillary bed of the adenohypophysis. The concentration of the regulatory hormones is therefore very high at their site of action – the pituitary gland – yet remains low in the larger systemic circulation.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Superior hypophyseal artery from internal carotid artery (Infundibulum and Adenohypophysis)<br>- Inferior hypophyseal artery from internal carotid artery (Neurohypophysis)|
|Venous|- Superior, inferior, and lateral hypophyseal veins into the cavernous sinus and intercavernous sinus|

#### Portal Circulation of the Pituitary Gland

The vascular supply of the pituitary gland has a special feature, namely the second portal vein system of the body (in addition to the portal vein system of the liver). Releasing hormones from the hypothalamus enter the adenohypophysis through the portal vein system, where they regulate the secretion of various hormones.

- Goal: Achieve high concentrations of hypothalamic regulatory hormones in the adenohypophysis.
- Portal circulation
    - Supply vessel: A. hypophysialis superior from A. carotis interna
    - 1. Capillary system: At the eminence mediana of the hypothalamus at the transition to the pituitary stalk (floor of the III. ventricle)
        - Fenestrated capillaries allow for the absorption of hypothalamic regulatory hormones here.
    - Interposed vessels: The portal hypophyseal veins transport the regulating hormones along the pituitary stalk to the adenohypophysis.
    - 2. Capillary system: Distributes the hypothalamic hormones in the adenohypophysis, where they control the synthesis and secretion of the anterior pituitary hormones.

> [!NOTE]
> The blood-brain barrier is abolished in the pituitary gland at two locations where hypothalamic axons release hormones into the blood: in the median eminence at the pituitary stalk and in the neurohypophysis!

## Microscopic Anatomy

While the adenohypophysis contains epithelial cells as an endocrine gland, the neurohypophysis contains axons of hypothalamic neurons.

### Adenohypophysis

The adenohypophysis has an anterior lobe and a intermediate lobe. The anterior lobe consists of epithelial cell nests, between which sinusoids run. The various hormones are released into these. The intermediate lobe of the pituitary is a remnant of Rathke's pouch and lies between the anterior lobe and the neurohypophysis.

#### Frontal lobe (= Distal part)

In the frontal lobe, the following cells are distinguished:

- Acidophilic cells: biosynthesis and secretion of non-glandotropic hormones, most abundantly present
    - Somatotrope cells: Growth hormone
    - Mammotrope cells: Prolactin
- Basophil cells: Biosynthesis and secretion of glandotropic hormones (e.g. LH/FSH, TSH)
    - Corticotrope Cells: ACTH
    - Gonadotrope cells: LH/FSH
    - Thyrotrope cells: TSH
- Chromophobe cells: Exact function unclear

#### Middle lobe (= Pars intermedia)

- Basophil cells (correspond to the corticotropic cells of the anterior lobe)
- Colloid cysts with cubic epithelium: Remnants of the Rathke pouch

### Neurohypophysis

The neurohypophysis (corresponding to the posterior pituitary) does not contain its own neuronal cell bodies, but only the axon terminals of hypothalamic neurons and glial tissue.

- Axons of hypothalamic neurons with Herring bodies
- Glial cells, also known as pituicytes
- Sine wave with fenestrated endothelium: Passage of hormones into the blood

> [!NOTE]
> The neurohypophysis does not contain neuronal cell bodies!

## Overview of Pituitary Hormones

The pituitary gland is involved in the secretion of a number of important hormones. The adenohypophysis synthesizes its six hormones itself, while the neurohypophysis stores the two hormones produced by the hypothalamus, ADH and oxytocin, and releases them into the blood as needed.

### Principle of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis

The secretion of pituitary hormones from the anterior pituitary is regulated by releasing hormones from the hypothalamus, which reach the anterior pituitary through the hypophyseal portal veins. The hypothalamic releasing hormones are secreted in a pulsatile manner and are influenced by higher brain centers and regulatory circuits. These so-called "neuroendocrine regulatory circuits" operate on the principle of negative feedback. The following distinctions are made:

- "Short Feedback Loop": Adenohypophysis hormones inhibit the synthesis of regulatory hormones in the hypothalamus.
- "Long Feedback Loop": The effector hormones of the target organs inhibit the synthesis of the regulatory hormones in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.

#### Releasing-/Inhibiting-Hormone

- Definition "Releasing-" / "Inhibiting-Hormone": Regulatory peptide hormones of the hypothalamus that regulate the secretion of various pituitary hormones.
- Structure: Short peptide hormones, arise from the proteolysis of longer precursor molecules.
- Secretion: Secretion from the hypothalamus occurs pulsatile, which is essential for function.

#### Neuroendocrine feedback loop using the example of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (CRH, ACTH, and cortisol)

An example of a neuroendocrine feedback loop is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In the hypothalamus, for instance, during physical stress, CRH is released in increased amounts. This leads to the secretion of ACTH in the adenohypophysis, which in turn causes the synthesis and secretion of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. Cortisol, in turn, inhibits the secretion of CRH in the hypothalamus and ACTH in the pituitary gland.

1. CRH (= Corticotropin-releasing hormone)
    - Synthesis site: Hypothalamus
    - Regulation of secretion
        - ↑ due to stress, hypoglycemia, etc.
        - ↓ due to high cortisol concentration
    - Function: Stimulation of ACTH secretion
2. ACTH (= Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)
    - Synthesis site: Adenohypophysis
    - Regulation of secretion
        - ↑ through CRH
        - ↓ through cortisol
    - Function: Stimulation of cortisol synthesis and release
3. Cortisol in the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata)
## Hormones of the Adenohypophysis

The adenohypophyseal hormones can be divided into glandotropic and non-glandotropic hormones based on their site of action.

- Glandotropic Hormone (ACTH, LH, FSH, TSH): Act on peripheral endocrine glands → Release of hormones
- Non-glandotropic hormones (growth hormone (GH), prolactin): Act directly on the target organ.

### Glandotrope Hormone – Overview

The glandotropic hormones of the adenohypophysis are ACTH, the gonadotropins LH and FSH, and TSH. Since the corresponding regulatory circuits are dealt with in the target organs, only a rough overview is provided here.

#### Proopiomelanocortin (POMC)

The polypeptide POMC is a precursor molecule for various hormones and is found in several structures. For example, endorphins are cleaved from POMC in the hypothalamus, while in the corticotropic cells of the adenohypophysis it serves as a precursor molecule for ACTH and in the keratinocytes of the skin it acts as a precursor molecule for α-MSH.

- Examples of derivatives of POMC
    - ACTH
        - α-MSH
    - β-MSH
    - β-Endorphin
    - Met-Enkephalin

> [!NOTE]
> Hyperpigmentation in primary adrenal insufficiency

> [!NOTE]
> A primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) leads to a low cortisol concentration in the blood with symptoms such as weakness and weight loss. In response, the pituitary gland produces increased amounts of POMC, from which ACTH is formed through cleavage to stimulate cortisol production. As a byproduct, α-MSH is also produced through further cleavage of ACTH, which stimulates the melanocytes of the skin to increase melanin production. Therefore, affected individuals may have an unusually dark skin color (even in protected skin areas such as the palms!).

### Non-glandotropic Hormones

The two non-gonadotropic hormones of the adenohypophysis are growth hormone and prolactin. Both are stored in granules of somatotropic and mammotropic cells, released into the blood as needed, and act directly on their target organs.

#### Growth Hormone (syn. Growth Hormone (GH), Somatotropin, somatotropic hormone (STH))

The growth hormone produced in the adenohypophysis influences body growth and metabolic processes.

##### Metabolism

- Structure: Peptide hormone with 191 amino acids
- Synthesis: In the context of protein biosynthesis, in somatotropic cells of the adenohypophysis.
- Storage: Granules of somatotropic cells
- Transport: Freely soluble in blood

##### Effects

- Mechanism of action
    - Direct effect: GH binds to the namesake GH receptor (tyrosine kinase-associated receptor)
    - Indirect effect: Binding to hepatic GH receptors leads to the synthesis of IGF in the liver
        - IGF I + II: Growth factors synthesized and secreted in the liver
            - Structure: Similarity to insulin
            - Transport in the blood: Bound to IGF-binding proteins
            - Function
                - IGF I: Mediates the processes mentioned below together with growth hormone.
                - IGF II: Particularly embryonic and fetal growth factor
- Effects
    - Body growth↑
        - Body weight, muscle mass, and size of internal organs ↑
        - Bone growth: Influence of GH directly and locally induced IGF
            - Promotes appositional bone growth ("thickening growth")
            - Chondrocyte maturation and proliferation
            - Osteoblast and osteoclast proliferation (overall positive bone balance = more formation than resorption)
            - Proteoglycan synthesis → Formation of extracellular matrix↑
    - Metabolism↑ (Lipolysis↑, Blood sugar level↑, Protein synthesis↑)

##### Regulation

- Basal secretion: In the first half of the night, the GH concentration is highest (circadian rhythm).
- Increased secretion by
    - GHRH from the hypothalamus↑
    - Ghrelin
    - Thyroid hormones↑
    - Estrogens and Testosterone (Puberty)↑
    - Hypoglycemia
- Decreased secretion by
    - Somatostatin↑
    - Growth hormone↑
    - IGF↑
    - Fatty acids↑
    - Hyperglycemia

> [!NOTE]
> The growth hormone exerts its effects primarily through growth factors from the liver!

> [!NOTE]
> The growth hormone works in protein metabolism similarly to insulin, while in glucose and lipid metabolism it acts as an insulin antagonist!

> [!NOTE] Acromegaly
> From the tissue of the adenohypophysis, tumors can develop that produce hormones. If growth hormone-producing cells become malignant, there is a significantly increased concentration of growth hormone in the blood. Depending on when the disease occurs, it presents clinically as follows: before the end of physical growth, gigantism occurs, where body proportions remain intact. After the end of growth and thus after the closure of the epiphyseal plates, mainly the acral parts and/or the internal organs continue to grow under the influence of high concentrations of growth hormone. This results in a typical appearance with a large nose, enlarged brow ridges, and a pronounced chin.

> [!NOTE] Dwarfism
> There are congenital disorders of GHRH synthesis that result in a growth hormone deficiency. Those affected often present with short stature in early childhood. Additionally, they often develop obesity, as the lipolytic effect of growth hormone is absent and thus fat reserves cannot be mobilized. The therapy consists of lifelong substitution of growth hormone. If started early, those affected usually achieve nearly normal height.

#### Prolactin

Prolactin is produced in the adenohypophysis and plays a role in the differentiation of the breast gland during pregnancy and the induction of milk production.

##### Metabolism

- Structure: Peptide hormone with 199 amino acids
- Synthesis: In the context of protein biosynthesis, in lactotropic (= mammotropic) cells of the adenohypophysis
- Storage: In granules of the mammotropic cells
- Transport: Freely soluble in blood

##### Effect

- Molecular mechanism of action: Activation of a membrane-bound receptor (tyrosine kinase-associated receptor)
- Effect on target organ: Growth and differentiation of mammary glands as well as milk production and secretion

##### Regulation

- Basal secretion
    - Circadian Rhythm: The highest release occurs in the second half of the night.
    - Dependency of the secreted prolactin amount on the reproductive status of the woman
        - Before puberty: Prolactin↓
        - Ovulation and second half of the cycle: Prolactin↑
        - End of pregnancy and postpartum: Prolactin↑↑↑
- Increased secretion by
    - Nerve afferents from the breast during breastfeeding
    - Estrogens↑
    - TRH, VIP, Angiotensin II/ADH, endogenous Opioids, Stress
- Decreased secretion due to: Dopamine from the hypothalamus (constantly inhibits the secretion of prolactin)

> [!NOTE]
> Prolactin does indeed affect the female cycle, so for many women, ovulation (and thus menstruation) is absent during breastfeeding. However, this alone does not provide a reliable form of contraception!

> [!NOTE] Prolactinoma
> Prolactinoma is the most common hormone-producing tumor of the anterior pituitary gland. A prolactinoma leads to elevated prolactin levels in the blood. In women, this can trigger lactorrhea, as prolactin induces milk production. Because prolactin in high concentrations inhibits LH secretion in the pituitary gland and can thus prevent ovulation, amenorrhea is also possible. In men, high prolactin levels can lead to impotence or gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue). The disease is treated with medications that have dopaminergic effects, as dopamine physiologically inhibits prolactin synthesis.

> [!NOTE] Weaning
> Dopamine inhibits the release of prolactin and thus milk production. If a breastfeeding mother suddenly wants to wean, e.g., due to an inflammation of the nipples, this effect can be utilized and medications that have a dopamine-like effect, known as dopamine agonists, can be prescribed. These then reduce milk production.

## Hormones of the Neurohypophysis

The neurohypophysis releases ADH and oxytocin. Both hormones have a similar structure. They are produced in the hypothalamus and transported via axonal transport to the neurohypophysis, where they are stored and released as needed.

### ADH (syn. Antidiuretic Hormone, Adiuretin, Vasopressin)

The ADH plays an important role in regulating fluid balance. It is synthesized in hypothalamic nuclei and reaches the neurohypophysis via axonal transport, where it is released.

#### Metabolism

- Structure: Nonapeptide (= peptide made of 9 amino acids) with an internal disulfide bridge
- Synthesis areas: Nucleus supraopticus and paraventricularis of the hypothalamus
- Synthesis steps
    1. Biosynthesis of a precursor peptide in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the cell bodies in the hypothalamus
    2. Packaging in "neurosecretory" granules in the Golgi apparatus
    3. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule into ADH and neurophysin (= companion protein) in the granules.
    4. Axonal transport of the granules along the infundibulum into the neurohypophysis
- Secretion: As needed from the granules at the axon terminals
- Transport: Freely soluble in blood

#### Effects

- Vascular muscle: Contraction and thus increase in blood pressure (via V1 receptor)
    - Mechanism: Activation of the Gq protein-coupled V1 receptor → Stimulation of phospholipase Cβ → IP3↑ → Intracellular Ca2+ concentration↑ → Contraction↑
- Kidney (collecting duct via V2 receptors)
    - Stimulates water reabsorption
        - Mechanism: Stimulation of adenylate cyclase → cAMP↑ → Incorporation of aquaporin-2 molecules (= water channels) into the luminal membrane of the collecting ducts → Reabsorption of water from the primary urine↑
    - Activates the installation of the urea transporter 1
- CNS: Stimulates the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary (acts synergistically with CRH), also likely involved in memory processes.

#### Regulation

- Stimulation through
    - Osmolarity of blood plasma↑
    - Blood pressure↓
    - Blood volume↓
    - Angiotensin II↑
    - Nicotine↑
    - Acetylcholine↑
- Inhibition by: Ethanol

> [!NOTE]
> ADH increases blood pressure via V1 receptors and enhances water reabsorption through V2 receptors!

> [!NOTE]
> The regulation of ADH secretion, unlike the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones, is not subject to any hypothalamic regulatory hormone!

> [!NOTE] Diabetes insipidus
> In central diabetes insipidus, an insufficient secretion of ADH from the neurohypophysis leads to a lack of water channels in the collecting ducts of the kidney. Patients lose large amounts of dilute urine (up to 20 liters a day!) and complain of extreme thirst and frequent urination. This results in hypertonic dehydration (also known as hypertonic hypohydration). This means that per unit volume of serum, there are more electrolytes present; thus, the serum osmolality increases. ADH-like substances can be administered, for example, as a nasal spray to alleviate the symptoms. In contrast, in renal diabetes insipidus, the V2 receptors in the collecting ducts and distal tubules of the kidney do not respond adequately to ADH, which is why the reabsorption of water from the primary urine decreases. The renal form can occur, for example, in chronic hypercalcemia, where presumably the downregulation of the expression of aquaporin-2 molecules plays a role.

### Oxytocin

Oxytocin (from Greek okytokos = "easy to give birth") plays an important role during and after childbirth. For example, it triggers contractions of the uterus (the labor pains) and stimulates milk ejection from the mammary gland postnatally. Furthermore, oxytocin also influences behavior in both sexes: it not only strengthens the parent-child relationship but also the couple relationship.

#### Metabolism

- Structure
    - Nonapeptide (= peptide made of 9 amino acids) with an internal disulfide bridge
    - Resembles the structure of ADH; amino acid sequences differ at only two positions.
- Synthesis sites: Nucleus supraopticus and paraventricularis of the hypothalamus
- Synthesis steps
    1. Biosynthesis of a precursor peptide in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the hypothalamic cell bodies
    2. Packaging in neurosecretory granules in the Golgi apparatus
    3. Proteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule into oxytocin and neurophysin (= accompanying protein) in the granules.
    4. Axonal transport of the granules along the infundibulum into the neurohypophysis
- Secretion: Release from the axon terminals in the neurohypophysis
- Transport: Freely soluble in blood

#### Effects

- Smooth Muscle: Contraction in the uterus (supporting labor activity) and mammary glands (milk ejection)
    - Mechanism: Binding to a Gq protein-coupled receptor → Activation of phospholipase C → Production of IP3 → Binding to IP3 receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum → Increase in calcium release
- ZNS: Strengthening interpersonal bonds

#### Regulation

- Stimulation through
    - Nerve afferents from the stretched birth canal during delivery
    - Nerve afferents during the sucking of the newborn at the breast
    - Exchange of affection, orgasm

> [!NOTE] Weheninduction
> If a pregnant woman has significantly exceeded her due date without any signs of labor, oxytocin may be administered in obstetrics to induce labor. Here, it leads to increased contractions by contracting the smooth muscle of the uterus.

#### Endocrine Regulation of Lactation

The formation of breast milk is subject to complex hormonal interactions.

1. Lactogenesis: The high concentration of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy causes the glandular differentiation of the mammary gland.
2. Galactogenesis: After childbirth, the levels of estrogen and progesterone drop. High prolactin levels then cause milk production and the onset of milk flow.
3. Galactopoiesis: The suckling reflex leads to the release of oxytocin and prolactin. In particular, prolactin maintains milk production.
    - Prolactin suppresses FSH and LH → Absence of follicle maturation: Lactation amenorrhea
4. Galactokinesis: High oxytocin levels trigger milk ejection through the contraction of the myoepithelial cells in the gland ducts. The suckling reflex, in turn, maintains the oxytocin levels and thus sustains the milk flow.
## Development

The two parts of the pituitary gland have different evolutionary origins. The neurohypophysis develops from the floor of the third ventricle and therefore belongs to the diencephalon. In contrast, the adenohypophysis is of epithelial origin and develops from the surface ectoderm.

### Adenohypophysis

- Source tissue: Surface ectoderm
- Development Process
    1. Starting from the roof of the mouth pouch, the so-called Rathke's pouch develops, an epithelial outpouching.
    2. The Rathke's pouch moves further cranially due to the growth of the embryo.
    3. The epithelial connection strand between the Rathke pouch and the oral cavity regresses.
    4. The Rathke's pouch reaches the diencephalon and attaches to it

#### Neurohypophysis

- Source tissue: Neuroectoderm
- Development Process
    1. Bulge of the third ventricle floor
    2. Lumen closes itself
    3. Development of the infundibulum and neurohypophysis
    4. Differentiation of cells into glial cells
    5. Ingression of hypothalamic axons
## Review Questions on the Chapter Pituitary Gland
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Where is the pituitary gland located and which venous blood vessel does it border?  
- The pituitary gland lies in the hypophyseal fossa of the sella turcica and is laterally bordered on both sides by the cavernous sinus.  
How can the pituitary gland be accessed surgically?  
- The pituitary gland can be surgically accessed via the so-called transsphenoidal approach. In doing so, the pituitary gland is approached through the nasal cavity and the sphenoidal sinus (i.e. sphenoid sinus). This is possible because between the sphenoidal sinus and pituitary gland there is only a thin bony lamella.  
### Hormones of the Adenohypophysis

Name examples of descendants of POMC!  
- Descendants of POMC include ACTH, α-MSH, β-MSH, β-endorphin, and Met-enkephalin.  
Name two possible triggers for increased CRH secretion from the hypothalamus!  
- Triggers for increased CRH secretion from the hypothalamus include, for example, stress or hypoglycemia.  
Which hormone causes a suppression of ACTH release from the pituitary gland?  
- Cortisol causes suppression of ACTH release from the pituitary gland. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of this glucocorticoid in the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata). Cortisol then inhibits the secretion of ACTH from the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary) via negative feedback.  
Which hormone is the most important stimulator of GH secretion besides GHRH?  
- Besides GHRH, ghrelin is the most important stimulator of GH secretion! It is considered a hunger hormone and is released from endocrine cells of the stomach. Its release decreases with food intake. Ghrelin triggers both hunger sensation and GH release from the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary).  
What influence does hypothalamic dopamine have on prolactin release?  
- Hypothalamic dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion in the adenohypophysis. It is significantly involved in the regulation of prolactin and is therefore also called prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH).  
What are the effects of growth hormone (GH) on the body?  
- Growth hormone (GH) leads to increased body growth and metabolism (increased lipolysis, blood sugar level, and protein synthesis).  
What effect does a low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia) have on the release of growth hormone (GH)?  
- Among the actions of growth hormone (GH, somatotropin) is raising blood sugar levels. Therefore, the release of growth hormone from the adenohypophysis is enhanced by a low blood sugar level (so-called hypoglycemia).  
What does an overproduction of GH after the closure of the epiphyseal plates lead to?  
- Overproduction of growth hormone after closure of the epiphyseal plates leads to so-called acromegaly, which manifests as enlargement of the skull, extremities, and internal organs.  
What effect does hyperprolactinemia have on the release of LH from the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary)?  
- Prolactin acts at high concentrations to inhibit LH release in the pituitary. In cases such as prolactinoma, this can cause ovulation to fail, which manifests as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation). In normal concentrations, however, prolactin supports gonadal function and thus the physiological reproductive cycle of women.  
When is the basal secretion of growth hormone (GH) highest?  
- GH secretion follows a circadian rhythm, with a secretion maximum reached in the first half of the night.  
Describe the direct and indirect molecular mechanisms of action of growth hormone (GH).  
- Direct mechanism of action of growth hormone: GH binds to its namesake GH receptor, a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor. Indirect effect: GH binds to hepatic GH receptors and thus leads to synthesis of IGF in the liver.  
In which section of the pituitary gland is TSH (Thyroid-stimulating hormone) produced?  
- TSH is produced in the thyrotropic cells of the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis). Its synthesis and release are stimulated by the hypothalamus-produced releasing hormone TRH (thyroliberin).  
### Hormones of the Neurohypophysis

What effect does ADH have on the smooth muscle of blood vessels and how is this effect mediated at the molecular level?  
- ADH acts contractingly on smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. The underlying mechanism is a signaling cascade beginning with ADH binding to the V1 receptor and stimulating formation of IP3. This increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration and leads to muscle contraction. ADH thus causes vasoconstriction and thereby increases arterial blood pressure.  
What effect does an increasing central venous pressure have on the release of ADH from the neurohypophysis?  
- ADH is a hormone of circulatory and volume regulation that promotes water retention in the kidney. Therefore, it is released more during water deficiency and hypotension, whereas high central venous pressure (CVP) as a sign of volume overload inhibits its release.  
Does an increase in plasma osmolality enhance or decrease the release of ADH?  
- Increased plasma osmolality is detected by osmoreceptors of the neurohypophysis, which then mediate enhanced release of ADH. Through this hormone, more aquaporins are inserted in the collecting duct epithelium—thus more water is reabsorbed and plasma osmolality decreases again.  
What disease can a severe deficiency of ADH lead to, and how does this disease develop pathophysiologically?  
- Severe ADH deficiency can lead to diabetes insipidus! Characteristic is extremely high water excretion with volume loss and marked thirst. The ADH deficiency manifests because fewer aquaporins are inserted in the renal tubules, so the kidney can only poorly reabsorb water.  
How does ADH molecularly act on its target cells in the kidney?  
- ADH stimulates epithelial cells of the collecting duct via V2 receptors to insert aquaporins (= water channels) into the luminal cell membrane. This allows water to be reabsorbed from the urine, increasing intravascular volume.  
What effect does oxytocin have on uterine muscles during childbirth?  
- Oxytocin acts on the uterus via oxytocin receptors localized in the myometrium. After binding, intracellular calcium concentration increases, leading to stronger contractions of the uterine muscles.  
Oxytocin is released after birth through the stimulation of the nipples during breastfeeding, and it has the effect of promoting milk ejection from the mammary tissue.  
- After birth, oxytocin serves milk ejection during breastfeeding of the newborn by causing myoepithelial cells in the mammary gland lobules to contract. Tactile stimulation of the nipples by the newborn’s sucking promotes oxytocin release.  
In which section of the pituitary gland is oxytocin synthesized and secreted, from which nuclei and from which cell types?  
- Oxytocin is synthesized by neurosecretory cells in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Via the axons of the producing neurons, it reaches the neurohypophysis, where it is secreted.  
From which precursor and through which biochemical process is ADH produced?  
- ADH is produced in the neurohypophysis by limited proteolysis from the so-called "pre-pro-vasopressin."  
What pathomechanism underlies the renal or central form of diabetes insipidus?  
- In central diabetes insipidus, less ADH is secreted. In the renal form, the kidney’s V2 receptors respond poorly to ADH. In both cases, there is reduced water reabsorption.
