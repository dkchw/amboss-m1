# Testicles
## Summary

In the paired testicles (lat. testis), the sperm necessary for reproduction are formed. Embryologically, the testicle develops in the abdominal cavity and descends into the scrotum. This explains the vascular supply from the upper abdomen as well as the origin of the testicular coverings from the abdominal wall layers (see sexual development). The main task of the testicle is spermatogenesis. Until puberty, the germ cells develop only up to the stage of spermatogonia. From the onset of spermarche until the end of life, the spermatids are then produced in the testicle and transmitted to the epididymis, where they can develop into mature sperm. Furthermore, 95% of male sex hormones (androgens) are produced in the testicle. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on testicles, epididymis, and spermatic cord in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the testis.

- Efferent ductules of the testis: Approximately 12 coiled ducts that connect the rete testis with the epididymis.

#### Scrotal Covers

The testicle is surrounded by a multilayered testicular envelope. Since it develops intra-abdominally and descends into the scrotum during further development through the evagination of the abdominal wall layers, the testicular envelopes each have an intra-abdominal correlate.

|Testicular sheaths  <br>(inside → outside)|   |Description|Intra-abdominal correlate|
|---|---|---|---|
|Tunica vaginalis testis|   |- Serous covering of the testis<br>    - Epiorchium (Visceral layer): Surrounds the testis directly<br>    - Periorchium (Parietal layer): Separated from the testis by a serous space (= Cavitas serosa scroti)<br>    - Mesorchium: Fold between the visceral and parietal layers of the tunica vaginalis (epiorchium and periorchium), through which the vessels of the testis pass|- Visceral and parietal peritoneum|
|Fascia spermatica interna|   |- Inner fascial layer|- Transversalis fascia|
|M. cremaster|   |- Cremaster muscle<br>- Cremaster reflex: Stroking the inner thighs → Testicle is lifted ipsilaterally<br>    - Stimulus conduction: N. genitofemoralis (Segment L1–2) with R. femoralis (afferent limb) and R. genitalis (efferent limb)|- M. obliquus internus abdominis and M. transversus abdominis|
|Fascia spermatica externa|   |- External fascial layer|- Abdominal fascia|
|Tunica dartos|   |- Fiber-rich subcutaneous connective tissue with embedded smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts|- Subcutis|
|Scrotal skin|   |- Skin of the scrotum|- Cutis|

> [!NOTE]
> If the cremaster is happy and lively, the testis hops up and down.

> [!NOTE] Hydrocele testis
> A hydrocele is a fluid accumulation between the parietal layer and the visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis testis in the scrotum, which is painless and usually easily palpable. It can occur after an inflammation or trauma, but in children, it can also arise due to an obliteration disorder of the processus vaginalis, which keeps the testis connected to the abdominal cavity.

### Topography of the Testis

- Location
    - Extraabdominal in the scrotum (= scrotum)
    - Mostly offset in height to each other
    - Surrounded by scrotal sacs
- Location relationships
    - Epididymis: The head of the epididymis lies adjacent to the upper pole of the testis, and the body of the epididymis extends to the posterior edge of the testis.
    - Spermatic cord: Borders the posterior edge down to the lower pole of the testicle

### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Testis and Epididymis

|Vessel Supply|   |Particularities|
|---|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. testicularis from the abdominal aorta|- Course<br>    1. Departure just below the renal artery<br>    2. Crossing of the ureter at the level of the navel<br>    3. Runs in the spermatic cord through the deep inguinal ring and the inguinal canal<br>    4. Anastomosis to the A. ductus deferentis from the A. umbilicalis|
|Venous|- Pampiniform plexus of the testicular vein into the renal vein (left)/inferior vena cava (right)|- Right-angled opening of the left testicular vein into the renal vein|
|Innervation|   |   |
|Autonomic nerve plexus|- Testicular plexus of the abdominal aortic plexus|   |
|Lymphatic drainage|   |   |
|Lymph nodes|- Right and left lumbar lymph nodes<br>- Scrotum: Superficial inguinal lymph nodes along the veins of the scrotum|   |

> [!NOTE]
> Blood supply, innervation, and lymphatic drainage of the testis originate from the upper abdomen, which is attributable to the descent of the testis during the fetal period.

> [!NOTE] Varicocele
> If a blockage occurs in the venous vessel course, it can lead to a backlog of venous blood with abnormal dilation and twisting of the pampiniform plexus. The left side is more frequently affected, as congestions often occur at the right-angled junction of the testicular vein with the renal vein. Causes can include, for example, infections; varicocele often appears idiopathically as well. The testicle is often enlarged and painless, and during examination, vascular bundles ("bag of worms") are palpable. However, in this combination of symptoms, one should always also consider a testicular tumor.

## Microscopic Anatomy

The lobules of the testes contain the main germ cell channels, where sperm maturation occurs with the help of Sertoli cells. In between, in the interstitium, are the androgen-producing Leydig cells. Mature sperm are released into the testicular network. The surrounding capsule of the testis has a two-layered structure.

- Lobules of the testis (testicular lobules)
    - Seminiferous tubules: Have a two-layer structure consisting of germinal epithelium and a lamina propria
        - Spermatogenic epithelium (= germinal epithelium): Consists of Sertoli cells and germ cells and is divided into a basal and an adluminal compartment.
            - Sertoli cells
                - Appearance: Single-layered, high-prismatic epithelial cells of the seminiferous tubules with uniformly stained, oval nucleus with a distinct nucleolus.
                - Function
                    - Function as a support structure and nourish the germ cells
                    - Formation of hormones (Inhibin, Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), Androgen-Binding Protein (ABP))
            - Germ cells: They undergo spermatogenesis in the germ epithelium from basal to luminal.
        - Lamina propria (= Basement membrane): Consists of collagen fibers and myofibroblasts
            - Myofibroblasts: Multilayered, elongated cells with a spindle-shaped nucleus
- Interstitium: The connective tissue stroma of the testis surrounds the germ cell channels and contains, in addition to nerves, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, the Leydig cells.
    - Leydig cells: Paracrine intermediate cells
        - Appearance: Large, peritubular clustered, cytoplasm-rich cells with characteristic inclusions (so-called Reinke crystals)
        - Function: Androgen production (testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) and paracrine secretion
- Rete testis (testicular network): Cuboidal, single-layered epithelium, partly covered with cilia.
    - Cilia serve to transport the still immobile sperm cells to the epididymis.

> [!NOTE] Malignant Testicular Tumors
> Testicular cancer often occurs in men between the ages of 20 and 50. The rate of cell division and reproductive capacity are particularly high during this stage of life; due to this rapid proliferation, degenerations can frequently occur. The most common form of testicular cancer is seminomas, which arise from the degeneration of spermatogonia. With timely diagnosis and therapy, seminomas have a good long-term prognosis.

### Blood-Testis Barrier

The spermatozoa formed in the germ epithelium are no longer genetically identical to the other cells in the body due to recombination (crossing over) during meiosis. Therefore, they must be protected by the blood-testis barrier from the body's immune system.

- Structure: Isolated microenvironment through tight junction barriers between the cell projections of Sertoli cells
- Function: Protection of germ cells
    - The development of germ cells occurs from the first meiotic division within the blood-testis barrier.
    - The blood-testis barrier is impermeable to cells and antibodies, thereby preventing the formation of autoantibodies against sperm.
## Spermatogenesis

With the onset of puberty between the ages of 9 and 14, the continuous production of sperm begins in the testes, during which spermatogonia develop into mature sperm through four stages of development.

### Stages of Spermatogenesis

The development of a mature sperm cell from a spermatogonium takes about 74 days. During maturation, the sperm gradually move lumenward in the seminiferous tubules, cross the blood-testis barrier, and finally differentiate into mature sperm.

|Stages of Spermatogenesis|Designation of Germ Cells|Processes|
|---|---|---|
|1. Origin|Germ Cells|- Formed in the 4th week of embryonic development in the yolk sac<br>- Move towards the gonadal ridge through amoeboid movements|
|Spermatogonia|- From the moment the primordial germ cells invade the gonadal ridge (testes), they are referred to as spermatogonia.<br>- Remain inactive until puberty|
|2. Proliferation (Mitosis)|Type A Spermatogonia|- Stem cells at the basal membrane of the seminiferous tubules<br>- Mitotic divisions into a stem cell (Type A spermatogonium) and several Type B spermatogonia|
|Type-B-Spermatogonia|- Formed by the mitotic division of Type-A spermatogonia<br>- DNA replication (Preparation for meiosis I)|
|3. Maturation (Meiosis)|Spermatocytes I|- Formed during the replication of DNA (preparation for Meiosis I) of type-B spermatogonia<br>- Traverse the blood-testis barrier to the lumen<br>- Subsequently enter the further phases of Meiosis I|
|Spermatocytes II|- Arise from meiosis I in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules from spermatocytes I<br>- Haploid chromosome set with two chromatids (1n, 2C)<br>- Spermatocytes II are usually not visible in histological preparations, as they only remain in this stage for a few hours|
|4. Differentiation<br><br>(Spermiogenesis)|Spermatids|- Two spermatids are formed by Meiosis II from a secondary spermatocyte<br>- Haploid chromosome set with one chromatid (1n, 1C)|
|Mature Sperm Cells  <br>(= Spermatozoa)|- Condensation of the nucleus (in the sperm head)<br>- Formation of the acrosome<br>- Development of the sperm tail|

> [!NOTE]
> In 7 stages, mature sperm develop from spermatogonia. In this process, four mature sperm are produced from one primary spermatocyte through meiosis.

### Structure of a mature sperm cell (spermatozoon)

A mature sperm cell is elongated and consists of three parts: the sperm head, neck, and tail. The sperm head contains the genetic material, a hydrolytic cap, and transitions into the motile sperm neck (the connecting link between the head and tail). The sperm tail (also called the flagellum) is further divided into three sections. Centrally, the axoneme for movement is located, which is surrounded in the midpiece by a mitochondrial sheath for energy provision.

- Total length: 50–60 μm
- Sperm head: Nucleus with an overlying acrosomal cap
    - Acrosome: Cap of the sperm cell
    - Origin: From fused lysosomes
    - Function: Contains hydrolytic enzymes for the penetration of the egg cell
- Sperm neck: Short connecting link with a movable basal plate for anchoring the axoneme to the sperm head.
    - Function: Control of movement
    - Contains the two centrioles that enable cell division after fusion with the egg cell.
- Sperm tail: Central axoneme surrounded by a special sheath.
    - Axoneme: Concentrically arranged microtubule fiber systems
        - Function: Movement of the sperm cell
        - Centerpiece
            - Energy production in the mitochondrial sheath for the movement of the sperm.
            - Closes with the main piece using the Anulus
            - Three-layer wall structure: Longitudinal fiber partition, mitochondrial sheath, plasma membrane
        - Main piece
            - Three-layer wall structure: longitudinal fiber boundary, ring fiber boundary, plasma membrane
        - End piece
            - Single-layer wall structure: Plasma membrane

> [!NOTE] Infertility (Impotentia generandi) of the man
> A male infertility in men with a desire to have children can have various causes. These range from embryological malformations of the primary sexual organs to a sperm dysfunction, post-inflammatory strictures of the seminal pathways (especially epididymitis and prostatitis), and hormonal causes (e.g., errors in testosterone synthesis). In cases of proven disorders in the seminal pathways with preserved spermatogenesis, artificial insemination may be attempted. This differs from impotentia coeundi, which is characterized by an inability to achieve an erection.

### Hormonal Regulation of Spermatogenesis

The maturation of sperm in men is hormone-dependent. Spermatogenesis is centrally controlled in the hypothalamus through the release of the hormones GnRH, LH, and FSH. The Sertoli cells and Leydig cells are responsible for the further hormone production in the testes. For detailed information on androgens and the pituitary feedback loop, see: Androgens.

- Five hormones are involved in spermatogenesis:
    1. GnRH: LH↑, FSH↑
    2. LH: Stimulates Leydig cells → Increases testosterone production↑
    3. FSH: Stimulates Sertoli cells → Spermatogenesis↑
    4. Inhibin: FSH↓ → Spermatogenesis↓ (neg. feedback)
    5. Testosterone: Spermatogenesis↑, high concentrations of testosterone: GnRH↓ + LH ↓ (neg. feedback)

## Review Questions for the Chapter on Testes
### Macroscopic Anatomy

In which lymph nodes does the lymph from the testes and epididymis primarily drain? How can this be explained?
- The primary lymphatic drainage of the testis runs along the testicular vessels to the lumbar lymph nodes (nodi lymphoidei lumbales dextri et sinistri) located next to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. Thus, the lymph flows into lymph nodes that are relatively far from the testis. The reason for this lies in the descent of the testis: the testis originally develops in the abdominal cavity and only descends into the scrotum during fetal development.
What is meant by a hydrocele testis, and between which two anatomical structures is it located?
- A hydrocele testis is an accumulation of fluid in the scrotum, more precisely between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis testis.
### Microscopic Anatomy

What hormones are produced in the Sertoli cells of the testis?
- The Sertoli cells produce inhibin, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), and androgen-binding protein (ABP).
What cells make up the germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules?
- The germinal epithelium of the seminiferous tubules (tubuli seminiferi contorti) consists of the Sertoli cells and the germ cells. The Sertoli cells are the actual epithelial cells and serve among other things as a support framework for the differentiating germ cells. The differentiation of germ cells begins from the basally located stem cells (spermatogonia). Adjacent to the spermatogonia toward the lumen are found the type I spermatocytes, type II spermatocytes, the spermatids, and finally the mature spermatozoa within the lumen.
### Spermatogenesis

What is meant by spermatogenesis and where does it take place?
- Spermatogenesis refers to the production of mature sperm from spermatogonia. Spermatogenesis takes place within the seminiferous tubules (tubuli seminiferi contorti) in the channels between the Sertoli cells.
What stages of spermatogenesis are distinguished?
- Spermatogenesis can be divided into four stages: 1. formation, 2. proliferation (mitosis), 3. maturation (meiosis), and 4. differentiation.
Which types of germ cells arise during spermatogenesis through the first and second meiotic division?
- From type I spermatocytes, the first meiotic division produces type II spermatocytes, which have a haploid chromosome set with two chromatids (1n, 2C). Through the second meiotic division, two spermatids arise from one type II spermatocyte, each with a haploid chromosome set and one chromatid (1n, 1C).
Describe the function and structure of the mature sperm tail!
- The tail of a mature spermatozoon is responsible for its motility, which is enabled by a central axoneme. It can be divided from the sperm neck to the tail end into a midpiece, principal piece, and end piece, each differing in wall structure: In the midpiece, the wall is three-layered and contains a mitochondrial sheath that produces the energy needed for movement. The wall of the principal piece consists of a keratin-containing fibrous sheath and a plasma membrane, whereas the end piece is surrounded only by a plasma membrane.
