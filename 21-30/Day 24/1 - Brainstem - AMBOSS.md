# Brainstem
## Summary

The brainstem is an important regulatory center in the human brain. All ascending and descending pathways of the central nervous system pass through it, many are interconnected in the core areas of the brainstem. It extends between the spinal cord and the diencephalon along the front of the cerebellum and is divided from bottom to top into three parts: the medulla oblongata (elongated marrow), the pons (bridge), and the mesencephalon (midbrain).

The nuclei and pathways in the mesencephalon and pons play a significant role primarily in the control and planning of movements, thus belonging mainly to the motor system. In contrast, the nuclei and pathways in the medulla oblongata are part of both the motor and the sensory and sensory systems: for example, portions of the auditory pathway and sensory fibers that are important for fine touch sensation run through here.

Distributed throughout the brainstem is the so-called reticular formation, a complex network of nerve cells. It contains the centers for many vital functions, such as the respiratory, circulatory, attentional, and vomiting centers. Furthermore, the reticular formation coordinates the connections of the many cranial nerve nuclei located in the brainstem.
## General

### Structure

The brainstem consists, from top to bottom, of the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata. It has an elongated shape and is slightly tilted forward (rostral). Its external structure is primarily due to the internally located nuclei and tracts.

#### Exterior View

The brainstem is only visible from the back after the removal of the cerebellum. When viewed from the front, the pons (the bridge) stands out in the eye. Its fibers run transversely, unlike those of the mesencephalon (midbrain) and medulla oblongata (extended medulla). The externally visible structures of the three parts of the brainstem are listed below from top to bottom.

### Topography

The brainstem is located in the rhombencephalon (hindbrain) near the clivus, a bony structure in the occipital bone.

#### Location Relationship

- Cranial: Hypothalamus, 3rd Ventricle
- Caudal: Continuation into the spinal cord
- Ventral: Optic chiasm, Pituitary stalk with Pituitary gland
- Dorsal: Cerebellum
- Lateral: Temporal lobe

### Vascular Supply

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. cerebelli from A. basilaris, A. vertebrales<br>- A. basilaris from A. vertebrales|
|Venous|- Transverse sinus in Sigmoid sinus<br>- Superior petrosal sinus in Sigmoid sinus<br>- Great cerebral vein in Rectus sinus|

#### Arterial Supply

The brainstem is supplied by branches of the cerebellar arteries and other branches of the vertebral arteries, which unite at the level of the pons to form the basilar artery. These branches then extend from there to their respective supply areas in the brainstem. The arterial blood supply to the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata is discussed in the respective sections.

#### Venous Outflow

The venous blood from the brainstem flows through a fine network of veins into the transverse sinus, the superior petrosal sinus, and into the great cerebral vein. The blood collects together in the sigmoid sinus, which then drains into the jugular vein. A distinction is made between a supra- (mesencephalon) and infratentorial (pons, medulla oblongata) drainage area, which is connected by anastomoses. The venous drainage from the mesencephalon, pons, and medulla oblongata is discussed in detail in the respective sections.

> [!NOTE] Venous occlusion in the brainstem
> The venous anastomoses in the brainstem are of great importance when, for example, a blockage of veins occurs due to thrombosis. The anastomoses then allow for the continued drainage of blood. In clinical practice, it should therefore be considered that a venous blockage often remains asymptomatic.

### Mesencephalon (Midbrain)

The mesencephalon is located between the diencephalon and the pons and is therefore the most cranially situated part of the brainstem. It is responsible for the modulation of extrapyramidal motor functions as well as for the routing of movement impulses and sequences. Additionally, the nuclei of the third (oculomotor nerve) and fourth (trochlear nerve) cranial nerves are also located here.

### Outline

The mesencephalon is divided in cross-section from ventral to dorsal into three sections. Each of these contains different nuclei and tracts.

- From ventral to dorsal
    - Cerebral peduncles (Hirnschenkel): Bundles of fibers that run from the cortex to the pons, to other brainstem nuclei, and to the spinal cord.
        - Arranged from medial to lateral: Frontopontine fibers, Corticonuclear fibers, Corticospinal fibers (Pyramidal tract), Temporopontine fibers, Occipitopontine fibers, Parietopontine fibers
    - Tegmentum mesencephali (midbrain tegmentum)
        - Substantia nigra and Nucleus ruber
    - Aquaeduct of the midbrain
    - Tectum mesencephali (midbrain roof; also known as Lamina tecti, Lamina quadrigemina or quadrigeminal plate): superior colliculi and inferior colliculi

### Vascular Supply

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Superior cerebellar artery from the cerebellar arteries<br>- Posterior cerebral artery and interpeduncular branches from the basilar artery<br>- Posterior communicating artery from the basilar artery<br>- Posterior choroidal artery from the basilar artery|
|Venous|- V. basalis in V. magna cerebri|

### Core Areas and Orbits

> [!NOTE] Lesion of the Cerebral Crus
> The various pathways of the crura cerebri are arranged from medial to lateral. Thus, in the event of damage, typical functional disturbances of the affected pathway occur. If the damage progresses from medial to lateral, first a functional impairment of the cerebellum is observed, followed by cranial nerve deficits, and ultimately pyramidal tract symptoms.

## Pons (Bridge)

The pons is the middle part of the brainstem, where the pontine nuclei ("bridge nuclei") and some cranial nerve nuclei are located. Unlike the fibers of the mesencephalon and the medulla oblongata, the pontine fibers run transversely. The pontine nuclei, together with the olivary nuclei in the medulla oblongata, control many movement processes.

### Outline

In the cross-section, the pons is divided into two sections from ventral to dorsal, which contain different nuclear areas.

- Basilar part of the pons (Brückenfuß): Pontine nuclei
- Tegmentum pontis (Pons): Cranial nerve nuclei

### Vascular Supply

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Long circumferential branches from A. basilaris<br>- Short circumferential branches from A. basilaris<br>- Pontine branches/Paramedian branches from A. basilaris|
|Venous|- Cerebellar veins in Transverse sinus, Petroclival sinus or Cerebellar veins|

### Core Areas

Here, the various core areas of the Pons are discussed in more detail. The cranial nerve nuclei are only mentioned (for more information see: Cranial Nerves).

#### Basilar part of the pons

- Ncll. of the bridge
    - Afferents: Corticopontine tract
    - Efferenzen: Pontocerebellar tract
    - Function: Correction and learning of movements

#### Tegmentum pontis

- Ncll. superior olives (“upper olive”)
    - Afferents: Anterior cochlear nucleus and Posterior cochlear nucleus
    - Efferents: Lateral lemniscus
    - Function: Interconnection of acoustic stimuli and reflexes
        - Directional Hearing
        - Stapedius reflex
- Ncll. n. trigemini (V. Hirnnerv)
- Ncl. n. abducentis (VI. Cranial Nerve)
- Ncll. facial nucleus (VII. cranial nerve)

> [!NOTE] Damage to the bridge cores
> Since the bridge nuclei are functionally closely linked to the cerebellum, the clinical presentation of damage can be very similar to that of a cerebellar damage (ataxia, reduced muscle tone, gaze stabilization problems). It should be noted here that the pyramidal tract passes through the ventral part of the pons and can thus also be additionally damaged. This leads to paralysis or muscle weakness.

## Medulla oblongata (Extended Mark)

The medulla oblongata is located between the pons and the spinal cord and is thus the most caudal part of the brainstem. It contains the posterior column nuclei (Ncl. gracilis and Ncl. cuneatus) as well as several cranial nerve nuclei. The medulla oblongata is traversed by descending and ascending pathways and controls vital functions of the body such as breathing, circulation, and the gag reflex.

### Outline

The medulla oblongata is divided from ventral to dorsal into two sections, which contain different nuclei and pathways.

- Pyramis (Pyramide): Continuous bands
- Tegmentum myelencephali: Ncl. gracilis, Ncl. cuneatus, nuclei of the VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves

### Vascular Supply

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. inferior posterior cerebelli from Aa. vertebrales<br>- A. spinalis anterior from Aa. vertebrales<br>- Rr. paramediani from Aa. vertebrales<br>- A. inferior anterior cerebelli from A. basilaris|
|Venous|- Dural sinus<br>- Spinal veins in posterior intercostal veins|

### Core Areas

In this table, the various core areas of the medulla oblongata are discussed in more detail. The cranial nerve nuclei are only mentioned here (for more information see: cranial nerves). More extensive explanations of the centers located in the medulla oblongata can be found in the section on the reticular formation.

> [!NOTE] Olivary lesions
> Due to the close connection of the olivary complex with the cerebellum, lesions of the olivary nuclei lead to similar symptoms, which, however, are usually less pronounced than those seen in cerebellar lesions. In affected patients, "ungainly" movement patterns, reduced muscle tone, balance and gait disturbances, as well as rhythmic twitching of the palate muscles (palatopharyngeal myoclonus) can be observed.

## Brainstem-wide: Reticular Formation

### Reticular formation

The reticular formation consists of gray matter and forms a network of nerve cells that permeates the entire brainstem down to the spinal cord. Its main task is the coordinated interconnection of brainstem nuclei and thus also the connection of vital functions (including breathing, circulation).

> [!NOTE] Brainstem reflexes:
> Brainstem reflexes refer to all reflexes that are switched at the brainstem on their way to their effector organ. They are considered foreign reflexes, meaning the reflex is perceived in one organ, but the reaction occurs in another organ. Brainstem reflexes can no longer be elicited only in the case of severe brain damage. Therefore, their functional assessment is of great importance, especially in the clinical evaluation of comatose patients and in brain death diagnostics. These include not only the vestibulo-ocular reflex but also the pupil, corneal, cough, and gag reflex.

#### Weck Center (ARAS)

- Location in the brainstem: Diffusely distributed
- Fiber path
    - Afferents: From dorsal horn of the spinal cord, brainstem nuclei, and cerebral cortex
    - Efferents: Transmit information to the Thalamus
- Function: Increase of attention and perception

> [!NOTE] Damage to the ARAS
> Damage to the ARAS can result in severe consciousness disorders up to coma. The cause may be an isolated damage to the mesencephalon, which occurs, for example, in the context of so-called upper brainstem herniation, from tumors, or perfusion disorders.

#### Brechzentrum (Area postrema)

- Location in the brainstem: Rhomboid fossa (Fossa rhomboidea)
- Fiber path
    - Afferents: Serotonin and Dopamine-mediated impulses
    - Effects: Regarding the muscles necessary for the act of vomiting (stomach, esophagus, throat)
- Function: Activation and coordination of the reflex arc that leads to vomiting

> [!NOTE] Increased Intracranial Pressure  
> Vom Area postrema mediated vomiting is often the only symptom of an increase in intracranial pressure and is therefore clinically particularly relevant.

  > [!NOTE] Antiemetics
> The area postrema has many receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. This is utilized in the treatment of nausea and vomiting by prescribing dopamine or serotonin antagonists. In the second half of life, the area postrema atrophies, and vomiting occurs less frequently.

#### Breathing Center

- Location in the brainstem: Mostly in the medulla oblongata
- Fiber path
    - Afferents
        - From N. vagus
        - From Glomus aorticum, Glomus caroticum, IX. and X. cranial nerve
        - From many other organs
    - Efferenzen
        - To brain nerve nuclei for tongue-, pharynx-, larynx- and facial musculature
        - Reticulospinal tract
        - To inspiratory and expiratory neurons
- Function: Coordination of inhalation, exhalation and cough reflex

> [!NOTE] Apnoetest
> The apnea test is also part of the examinations in the context of brain death diagnosis and checks the function of the respiratory center. After prior oxygenation, the ventilator is turned off for at least 4 minutes and the elevated CO2 level is continuously measured using a blood gas analysis (BGA). In living individuals, this hypercapnia would result in a spontaneously occurring, reflexive inspiration, but in brain-dead individuals, this reflex is absent. The apnea test should only be performed after all other examinations in the context of brain death diagnosis.

> [!NOTE] Central Sleep Apnea Syndrome  
> The inspiratory and expiratory neurons and thus automatic breathing are coordinated by the so-called Pre-Bötzinger complex in the medulla oblongata. While automatic breathing can be voluntarily controlled during wakefulness, it is modulated during sleep by chemical stimuli and vegetative reflexes. Damage to the medulla oblongata or (physiological) neuron loss in this Pre-Bötzinger complex with aging can therefore lead to breathing pauses during sleep. This is clinically known as "central sleep apnea syndrome" (Zentrales Schlafapnoe-Syndrom).

#### Circulatory Center

- Location in the brainstem: Medulla oblongata
- Fiber path
    - Afferents
        - From the Ncl. solitary tract
        - From the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex
        - From the heart and the vessels
        - Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and in the aortic arch
    - Efferenzen
        - To the Ncl. dorsalis n. vagi
        - Reticulospinal pathways
- Function: Mediation and regulation of blood pressure and other autonomic parameters

#### Motor Center

- Location in the brainstem: Mostly in Medulla oblongata
- Fiber path
    - Afferents
        - From the premotor cortex
        - From the cerebellum
        - From the limbic system
    - Differences
        - Reticulospinal tract
- Function
    - Control of trunk and proximal limb muscles
    - Regulation of muscle tone
    - Suppression of muscle spindle reflexes
    - Special feature: Ncl. pedunculopontinus

#### Pontine Micturition Center

- Location in the brainstem: Pons
- Fiber path
    - Afferents
        - From higher-order centers (Hypothalamus, Superior frontal gyrus medial, anterior Cingulate gyrus, Substantia nigra, Pallidum)
    - Efferenzen
        - Reticulospinal tract
- Function: Control of bladder emptying

#### Periaqueductal Gray (Substantia grisea periaquaeductalis/centralis)

- Location in the brainstem: Mesencephalon
- Fiber path
    - Differences to
        - Limbic System
        - Spinal Cord
        - Monoaminergic cell groups of the reticular formation
- Function
    - Coordination of the fear and flight reflexes
    - Coordination of the cranial nerve nuclei for voice formation
    - Impulse for endogenous pain suppression

> [!NOTE] Morphine
> Many afferents that end in the periaqueductal gray use endorphins as transmitters. They have a similar effect to morphine and bind to the same receptors. These afferents are important for endogenous pain suppression, which is utilized in pain therapy. The main target for opioids, the strongest pain relievers, is therefore located in the periaqueductal gray and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The term “opioids” encompasses morphine and other related substances.

## Brainstem-Crossing: Brainstem Pathways

Many pathways pass through the brainstem on their way up or down to their target organs. Some of them will be briefly summarized and discussed here.

### Pyramidal Train

For more information on the pyramidal tract, also known as the corticospinal tract, see: Spinal pathways and reflexes.

### Corticonuclear Pathway

#### Progress

- Pulls with the pyramidal tract from the motor cortex through the internal capsule
- Here, a part of the fibers crosses contralaterally.
- Ends in various motor cranial nerve nuclei

### Corticopontine Pathways

For more information, see: Pons

### Medial lemniscus and trigeminal lemniscus

The medial lemniscus is an important pathway for fine touch sensation. It is located in the mesencephalon and is formed by fibers from the dorsal column nuclei (nucleus gracilis, nucleus cuneatus). Together with the trigeminal lemniscus, which originates from the sensory trigeminal nucleus in the pons, it transmits its information to the thalamus.

#### Progress

- Contains fibers from the posterior column nuclei (fine touch sensation of the neck, trunk, and limbs) and the vestibular nuclei from the brainstem
- Fibers of the trigeminal lemniscus originate from the sensory main nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and join the medial lemniscus; further common course as medial lemniscus
- The medial lemniscus crosses to the opposite side after the dorsal column nuclei in the medulla oblongata
- Fibers that subsequently connect to the medial lemniscus cross over to the opposite side beforehand.
- Fibers are somatotopically arranged, meaning they are functionally organized (arrangement according to fibers for leg, trunk, arm, head)
- Information from the contralateral half of the body is switched in the thalamus to the 3rd neuron of the sensory pathway and ends in the postcentral gyrus (somatosensory part of the cortex)

### Spinothalamic tract

The spinothalamic tract carries fibers of coarse touch sensation to the thalamus (see: spinal cord).

#### Progress

- Origin in the anterior column of the spinal cord
- Connection to medial lemniscus in the mesencephalon
- Circuitry in the thalamus to the third neuron of the sensory pathway
- Projection onto postcentral gyrus

### Lemniscus lateralis

The lateral lemniscus is a part of the auditory pathway and is discussed in more detail under “auditory system.”

#### Course in the Brainstem

- Origin in the medulla oblongata
- A part of the fibers from the cochlear nuclei crosses over to the opposite side and joins the lateral lemniscus.
- Convergence in the Inferior colliculi in the Tectum of the midbrain on the 3rd or 4th Neuron of the Auditory pathway
- Forwarding of auditory information to the thalamus
- Circuitry in the thalamus and continuation to the auditory cortex

### Medial longitudinal fasciculus

- Union of several fiber groups found between the mesencephalon and thoracic spinal cord that enter or exit the brainstem at different levels.
- Main function: Networking of individual cranial nerves and other brainstem nuclei (especially the eye muscles) and thus also the connection of many reflex arcs and motor automatism (support motor skills, reflexive and voluntary eye movements)

### Dorsal Longitudinal Fasciculus

The so-called Schütz bundle is an important connection between the hypothalamus and the brainstem, and it enables communication and regulation of centers in the hypothalamus and parasympathetic nuclei in the brainstem or spinal cord.

### Central tegmental tract

The so-called central tegmental tract runs from the mesencephalon to the olive and transmits information from motor centers (e.g. red nucleus, reticular formation) to the olive.
## Cranial Nerve Nuclei

For more information on the cranial nerve nuclei, see: Cranial Nerves.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Brainstem
### Mesencephalon

Where is the mesencephalon located, and into what sections can it be divided from ventral to dorsal?
- The mesencephalon (midbrain) is the most cranially located part of the brainstem and lies between the diencephalon and pons. It can be subdivided from ventral to dorsal into three parts: 1. crura cerebri (cerebral peduncles), which contain fiber bundles running from the cortex to the pons, to other cranial nerve nuclei, and to the spinal cord; 2. tegmentum mesencephali, where the substantia nigra lies ventral to the red nucleus; 3. tectum mesencephali (quadrigeminal plate or lamina quadrigemina) with the superior and inferior colliculi.
What function does the substantia nigra have and where do its efferent pathways run?
- The substantia nigra is part of the extrapyramidal system and thus involved in the modulation of movement impulses and sequences. Its pars reticularis communicates via GABAergic efferents with the motor parts of the thalamus, and the pars compacta sends inhibitory dopaminergic efferents to inhibitory neurons in the striatum (inhibition of inhibitory neurons → activation).
What are the crura cerebri and what fiber bundles run in them?
- The crura cerebri are part of the mesencephalon and contain tracts running from the cortex to the pons (frontopontine fibers, temporopontine fibers, occipitopontine fibers, parietopontine fibers), to other brainstem nuclei (corticonuclear fibers), and to the spinal cord (corticospinal fibers).
### Pons

Where in the brainstem is the auditory pathway interconnected?
- The auditory pathway is interconnected in the brainstem in the pons and mesencephalon. Acoustic information is transmitted from the cochlear nuclei to the superior olivary nuclei (pons), which project via the lateral lemniscus to the inferior colliculi (mesencephalon). From there, the information is conveyed via the brachium of the inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate body (thalamus) and further to the primary auditory cortex.
### Medulla oblongata

Which core areas are located in the medulla oblongata?
- The core areas of the medulla oblongata include the inferior olivary nuclei located in the ventral pyramid and the dorsal column nuclei (nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus) located in the myelencephalic tegmentum, as well as the cranial nerve nuclei of the vestibular nerve and cochlear nerve (VIII), glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI), and hypoglossal nerve (XII).
### Brainstem-wide: Reticular formation

What function does the respiratory center have? In what clinical situation is this tested?
- The respiratory center is part of the reticular formation and controls exhalation and inhalation as well as the coughing reflex. In brain death diagnostics, the respiratory center is tested by switching off the ventilator for 4 minutes. If the resulting hypercapnia triggers spontaneous, reflexive inhalation, brain death is excluded.
About which neurotransmitter do the raphe nuclei communicate and what is their function?
- The raphe nuclei are serotonergic neurons. They send efferents to the limbic system, the ARAS, and the spinal cord and are thus involved in emotional processes, the sleep-wake cycle, and the descending pain-inhibiting system.
### Brainstem-Crossing: Brainstem Pathways

What information is transported in the medial lemniscus? Which two brain regions does it connect?
- The medial lemniscus is formed by fibers from the dorsal column nuclei nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus and contains information about fine touch sensations such as vibration. It connects the medulla oblongata with the thalamus.
What structure connects the hypothalamus and the brainstem? What function does it have?
- The dorsal longitudinal fasciculus connects the hypothalamus and brainstem as the so-called “Schütz bundle.” It is involved in the regulation of many autonomic processes.
