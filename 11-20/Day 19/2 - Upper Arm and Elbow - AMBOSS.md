# Upper Arm and Elbow
## Summary

The upper arm is part of the upper extremity: The shoulder joint connects it to the trunk and the shoulder girdle, while it is connected to the forearm via the elbow joint. On one hand, the muscles of the upper arm move the shoulder joint, while on the other hand, they provide its stability. In addition to movements of the elbow joint (e.g., flexion and extension), the upper arm muscles are also responsible for the rotation of the forearm (pronation and supination). Important conduits run between the muscles of the upper arm, which are significant for the blood supply and innervation of the entire upper extremity.
## Bones

### Humerus (Humerus)

The humerus can be divided from proximal to distal into the following sections and structures:

- Head of the humerus
- Neck of the humerus
    - Anatomical column
    - Greater tubercle
    - Lesser tubercle
    - Intertubercular sulcus
    - Surgical neck
- Humeral shaft
    - Deltoid tuberosity
    - Radial nerve sulcus
- Distal Humerus
    - Humeral trochlea
    - Head of the humerus
    - Ulnar nerve groove
    - Medial epicondyle of the humerus
    - Lateral epicondyle of the humerus
    - Radial fossa
    - Coronoid fossa
    - Olecranon fossa

> [!NOTE]
> Compared to the anatomical collum humeri, the collum chirurgicum is a predilection site for fractures, which is why it has been given this designation!

> [!NOTE] Musician's bone
> In the ulnar nerve sulcus, the ulnar nerve runs superficially and relatively unprotected. Therefore, impacts can lead to pain or tingling in the area of supply (the hollow of the hand and the palmar side of fingers IV and V) of the nerve.

## Joints

### The Elbow Joint (Articulatio cubiti)

- Definition: Formed by the humerus and the two forearm bones ulna (elbow) and radius (radius), and connects the upper arm and forearm.
- Function: Flexion/Extension and Pronation/Supination of the Forearm
- Joint type: Composite pivot-hinge joint (“trochoginglymus”)
    - Three joints: In a common joint capsule and joint cavity
        1. Humeroradial joint (Art. humeroradialis)
        2. Humeroulnar joint (Art. humeroulnaris)
        3. Proximal Radioulnar Joint (Proximal Radioulnar Joint)
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Humerus (Upper arm bone): Trochlea of the humerus and Capitulum of the humerus
        - Ulna (Elbow): Olecranon, Radial notch and Trochlear notch
        - Radius (Radius): Fovea capitis radii and Circumferentia radialis
    - Bands
        - Ulnar collateral ligament (inner ligament)
        - Radial collateral ligament (lateral ligament)
        - Lig. anulare radii (Annular ligament of the radius)

> [!NOTE]
> Distally from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, the radial head can be palpated (on the dorsal side). The so-called sacciform recess is an important reserve fold of the joint capsule at the radial head, which provides space for the rotational movement of the forearm (pronation and supination)!

> [!NOTE] Chassaignac paralysis
> In young children, the ligaments of the elbow joint are more elastic than in adults. Therefore, an inward rotation of the forearm combined with simultaneous pulling on the extended arm can lead to a subluxation of the radial head. This results in a painful restriction of movement in the arm, which is then held in a flexed and pronated position (hence the name "nursemaid's elbow"). The joint can usually be easily reduced by stretching and externally rotating the forearm.

## Muscles

The muscles of the upper arm can be classified into two groups – flexors and extensors. They are enveloped by the common brachial fascia (fascia brachii) and divided into a flexor compartment and an extensor compartment by the medial and lateral intermuscular septum.

### Flexors of the Upper Arm

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. brachialis|- Humeral shaft|- Ulnar tuberosity|- Elbow joint: Flexion|- N. musculocutaneus (C5–C7)|
|M. biceps brachii|- Supraglenoid tubercle scapula (Long head)<br>- Coracoid process scapula (Short head)|- Radial tuberosity|- Shoulder joint<br>    - Forward flexion<br>    - Internal rotation<br>    - Abduction<br>- Elbow joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Supination|

> [!NOTE]
> Both flexors of the upper arm are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve!

> [!NOTE]
> The M. biceps brachii is the strongest supinator and key muscle for the spinal cord segments C5 and C6 when the elbow joint is flexed!

> [!NOTE] Biceps tendon rupture
> In case of rupture of the long head of the biceps brachii, there is a so-called humeral head elevation. The reason for this is that the humeral head is no longer pressed against the shoulder joint surface by the long biceps tendon, and the effect of the trunk wall muscles prevails.

### Extensors of the Upper Arm

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. anconeus|- Lateral epicondyle of the humerus|- Dorsal ulnar surface distal to the olecranon|- Elbow joint<br>    - Extension<br>    - Capsule tension|- N. radialis (C5–Th1)|
|M. triceps brachii|- Infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula (origin of the long head)<br>- Lateral and dorsal surface of the humerus (origin of the lateral head)<br>- Medial and dorsal surface of the humerus (origin of the medial head)|- Olecranon|- Shoulder joint: Adduction<br>- Elbow joint: Extension|

> [!NOTE]
> Both extensors of the upper arm are innervated by the radial nerve!

> [!NOTE]
> The M. triceps brachii is the key muscle for the spinal cord segment C7. Its function is tested via the triceps tendon reflex!

## Topography

### Medial bicipital groove and lateral bicipital groove

Between the M. biceps brachii and the M. triceps brachii lies the medial bicipital groove, between the M. biceps brachii and the M. brachialis the lateral bicipital groove. These serve as channels for important vessels.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Arm and Elbow
### Joints

Which bones are involved in the elbow joint, what movements does it allow, and what is this type of joint called?
- The elbow joint (Articulatio cubiti) is formed by the humerus, ulna, and radius. It allows flexion/extension as well as pronation/supination of the forearm. This type of joint is referred to as a compound pivot hinge joint (hinge joint between the humerus and forearm bones and pivot joint between the forearm bones).

### Muscles

Name the origin, approach, and innervation of the flexors of the upper arm!
- Both flexors of the upper arm are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. The brachialis muscle originates from the body of the humerus and inserts at the ulnar tuberosity. The biceps brachii muscle has a long head, which originates at the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, and a short head, which originates at the coracoid process of the scapula. Its insertion is located at the radial tuberosity.

Which muscle is the strongest supinator when the elbow joint is flexed?
- The biceps brachii muscle is the strongest supinator when the elbow joint is flexed.

Which spinal cord segments can be tested with the biceps tendon reflex?
- The biceps brachii muscle is the key muscle for the spinal cord segments C5 and C6. This means that the biceps tendon reflex can clinically check whether there is damage to the spinal cord segments C5/C6, in whose context this muscle has failed.

What function does the M. triceps brachii have?
- The contraction of the triceps brachii muscle leads to extension at the elbow joint as well as adduction at the shoulder joint.
