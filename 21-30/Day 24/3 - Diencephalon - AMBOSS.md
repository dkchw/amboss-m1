# Diencephalon
## Summary

The interbrain (or diencephalon) lies between the midbrain and the cerebrum. It surrounds the third ventricle and is mostly covered by the cerebral lobes, making it hardly visible from the outside. The interbrain is divided into five levels, each having very different functions: The thalamus is the central switching point for all information flowing from the periphery to the cerebrum, and is therefore referred to as the "gateway to consciousness." The hypothalamus, on the other hand, operates independently of the cerebrum: It is the highest regulatory organ of the autonomic and endocrine systems. The subthalamus lies – as the name suggests – below the thalamus. Its nuclei belong to the basal ganglia, thus being part of the motor system. The metathalamus consists of the two paired "geniculate bodies" (Corpora geniculata), which are components of the visual and auditory pathways. Finally, the epithalamus plays important roles in regulating the circadian rhythm and in the integration of various sensory information (e.g., pupil reflex). It is associated with the prominent pineal gland (Glandula pinealis, epiphysis).
## Overview of the Diencephalon

The diencephalon is located between the midbrain and the cerebrum. It is almost entirely covered by the lobes of the cerebrum, with only the hypothalamus visible from the outside. The diencephalon surrounds the unpaired third ventricle and is divided into five areas. Their nomenclature is based on their location during embryonic development, relative to the largest structure: the thalamus.

|Area|Description|Location in the adult brain|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|Thalamus (Thalamus dorsalis)|- Paired collection of nuclei in the center of the diencephalon|- Centrally located in the diencephalon<br>- Bordered on both sides by the 3rd ventricle|- Connects and filters information coming from the sensory organs or other brain centers, and relays the filtered information to the cerebrum ("gateway to consciousness")|
|Subthalamus (Ventral thalamus)|- Two paired nuclei<br>    - Subthalamic nucleus<br>    - Globus pallidus|- Below the Thalamus|- Circuitry of motor information within the basal ganglia loops|
|Metathalamus|- Two paired bulging structures ("knee tubercles")<br>    - Lateral geniculate body<br>    - Medial geniculate body|- Behind the thalamus|- Processing sensory information (part of the auditory and visual pathway)|
|Epithalamus|- Consists of four parts<br>    - Epiphysis (Pineal gland, Glandula pinealis): Pea-shaped, externally visible structure<br>    - Habenulae with stria medullaris: Connects the epiphysis and thalamus<br>    - Area pretectalis<br>    - Commissura posterior|- Above the thalamus, slightly displaced backward|- Regulation of the circadian rhythm<br>- Connection of the pupillary reflex<br>- Connection of olfactory stimuli|
|Hypothalamus|- In the basal diencephalon, contains notable structures<br>    - Mamillary bodies<br>    - Tuber cinereum<br>    - Infundibulum with neurohypophysis|- At the bottom of the third ventricle|- The highest regulatory organ of the autonomic and endocrine systems|

> [!NOTE]
> The optic nerve and the optic chiasm are also counted among the diencephalon! They are, alongside the hypothalamus, the only structures of the diencephalon that can be seen from the outside!

## Thalamus (Dorsal Thalamus)

The thalamus (from Greek thalamos = "chamber") is located centrally in the diencephalon around the III. ventricle. It consists of many different nuclei, all of which have a strong connection to the cerebral cortex.

### Profile

- Function: Connects and filters information that comes from the sensory organs or other brain centers, and forwards it filtered to the cerebrum ("gate to consciousness")
- Location: On both sides of the third ventricle in the diencephalon
- Shape: Bean-shaped
- Size: 3 cm × 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm

### Anatomy of the Thalamus

The thalamus is a paired nuclear complex located in the upper diencephalon. In total, more than 100 nuclei belong to the thalamus.

- Construction
    - Macroscopic: Two halves (right and left thalamus)
        - Connection: Interthalamic adhesion
    - Microscopic: Many different nuclei groups (gray matter), which are separated by fiber strands (white matter).
- Location relationships
    - Medial: III. Ventricle
    - Lateral: Internal capsule

#### Important Thalamic Nuclei

Almost all fiber connections that draw from the periphery to the cerebrum are rerouted in the thalamus. The thalamus consists of over 100 nuclei, which are divided into two groups: nuclei with many direct connections to the cerebrum (formerly referred to as "specific thalamic nuclei") and nuclei with no or few direct connections to the cerebrum (formerly called "nonspecific thalamic nuclei"). The individual nuclear groups are separated from each other by fiber tracts (white matter).

##### Thalamic nuclei with many connections to described cerebral cortex areas (specific thalamic nuclei)

The thalamic nuclei that project directly to specific areas of the cerebral cortex were previously referred to as "specific thalamic nuclei." They can be further classified functionally and topographically (see below). The functions of the most important nuclei will be detailed further below.

- Important specific thalamic nuclei and their projection sites
    - Anterior core group (Anterior nuclei): Limbic System
    - Medial core group (Ncll. medial): Prefrontal cortex
    - Ventral Core Group (Ncll. ventrales)
        - Ncl. ventralis anterior (VA): Premotor Cortex
        - Ncl. ventralis lateralis (VL): Motor Cortex
        - Ncl. ventralis posterior (VP): Sensory cortex
    - Dorsal Core Group (Ncll. dorsales)
        - Pulvinar: Primarily visual centers in the parietal and temporal lobes

##### Thalamic nuclei without direct connections to described cerebral cortex areas (nonspecific thalamic nuclei)

Some thalamic nuclei do not project like the aforementioned to precisely defined areas of the cerebral cortex. Their efferents run rather nonspecifically to various regions of the cerebrum, which is why they were previously referred to as "nonspecific thalamic nuclei." They primarily play a role in regulating the state of consciousness.

- Important nonspecific thalamic nuclei
    - Intralaminar nuclei (intralaminare core group): The nucleus centromedianus is the largest representative of the intralaminar nuclei.
    - Ncl. reticularis

### Functions of the Thalamus

Almost all nerve fibers that run from the periphery to the cerebrum are relayed again in the thalamus. The main functions of the thalamus are briefly listed below.

#### Specific Thalamus

As a specific thalamus, the thalamic nuclei are referred to that project to specific areas of the cerebral cortex, and to which specific functions can be assigned. Based on their function, they can be grouped into the "motor thalamus", "sensory thalamus", and "emotional thalamus".

##### Motor Thalamus

The core of the motor thalamus is the Ncl. ventralis anterolateralis. It receives information from the motor centers of the CNS, processes it, and transmits it to the premotor and motor cortex. Similar to the motor cortex, the Ncl. ventralis anterolateralis is also organized somatotopically.

- Kern: Ncl. ventralis anterolateralis
    - Ncl. ventralis anterior
    - Ncl. ventralis lateralis
- Afferents: From the various motor systems of the brain
    - Basal ganglia (Pallidum, Substantia nigra)
    - Cerebellum
    - Motor and premotor cortex
- Efferents: Motor and premotor cortex
- Function: Coordination of voluntary motor skills

> [!NOTE]
> The motor thalamus plays an important role in the coordination of voluntary motor activity!

##### Sensitive Thalamus

The sensory thalamus is responsible for the targeted processing of sensory impressions from the entire body. Just like the sensory cortex, the nuclei of the sensory thalamus are organized somatotopically.

- Nucleus: Ncl. ventralis posterior (VP)
    - Ncl. ventralis posterolateralis (VPL)
    - Ncl. ventralis posteromedialis (VPM)
- Afferents: Somatosensory and viscerosensory fibers from the trigeminal area (VPM) or the spinal cord (VPL)
- Efficiencies: To the sensory cortex
- Function: Processing and filtering of incoming sensitive information

> [!NOTE]
> The sensitive thalamus processes and filters all information from the sensory system, with the exception of the olfactory pathway!

> [!NOTE] Thalamic pain
> The thalamus also plays an important role in the processing of pain perception. In the case of a stroke, there can be damage to pain-inhibiting areas in the thalamus. The result is severe pain in the affected half of the body, primarily in the extremities. The treatment of this "thalamic pain" is extremely difficult; even with intensive pain therapy, complete relief from pain is hardly achievable.

##### Emotional Thalamus

The anterior nuclei of the thalamus are functionally associated with the limbic system. They are an important component of the Papez circuit and, consequently, play a crucial role in the emergence and processing of emotions.

- Kernels: Previous Ncll.
- Afferents: The anterior nuclei receive numerous afferents from the limbic system and the cerebrum, e.g.:
    - From the mammillary corpora (about the mammillothalamic fasciculus)
    - From the isocortex (via the fornix)
- Efferenzen
    - To the cingulate gyrus (via the thalamocingulate tract)
    - To the parahippocampal gyrus
- Function: Emergence and Processing of Emotions

> [!NOTE]
> The emotional thalamus is part of the Papez circuit and is important for the processing of emotions within the limbic system!

#### Unspecific Thalamus

The most important function of the nonspecific thalamus is the nonspecific activation of the cortex; it is therefore also referred to as the "activating thalamus."

- Kernel
    - Intralaminar nuclei
    - Ncl. reticularis
- Afferents
    - Reticular formation (ascending activation system (ARAS))
    - Cerebral Cortex
    - "Specific" thalamic nuclei
    - Basal ganglia
    - Cerebellum
- Efferenzen:
    - Cerebral cortex (diffuse)
    - Executive organ of the ascending activation system (ARAS)
        - "Pre-excitation" of the neurons of the cortex in the sense of increased attention

> [!NOTE]
> The most important function of the nonspecific thalamus is the pre-excitation of the cortex in terms of increased attention!

## Subthalamus (Ventral Thalamus)

The subthalamus includes the Ncl. subthalamicus and the Globus pallidus (Pallidum). These are functionally part of the basal ganglia and are described in more detail there.
## Metathalamus

The metathalamus is located dorsally to the thalamus. It consists of the paired lateral and medial geniculate bodies.

| |Function|Afferents|Efferents|
|---|---|---|---|
|Lateral geniculate nucleus|Part of the visual pathway|"Optic tract" from the ipsilateral halves of the retina of both eyes|"Optic radiation": Primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe|
|Medial Geniculate Body|Part of the Auditory Pathway|"Brachia of the Inferior Colliculi" from the Inferior Colliculi|Auditory Cortex in the Temporal Lobe|

The medial geniculate body (melody) is part of the auditory pathway, the lateral geniculate body (light) is part of the visual pathway.
## Epithalamus

The epithalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the circadian rhythm and in the processing of sensory information. It is located on top of the thalamus from behind and consists of four parts. Its most distinctive structure is the pineal gland.

| |Description|Function|
|---|---|---|
|Pineal Gland (Pineal Body, Glandula pinealis)|- Shape: Pea-shaped<br>- Location: Above the Tectal Plate<br>- Afferents: Sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion<br>- Cells: Astrocytes, Pinealocytes (rudimentary photoreceptors)|- Produces the hormone Melatonin → Regulation of the circadian rhythm<br>    - Melatonin biosynthesis<br>        1. Acetylation of serotonin at the primary amino group (Serotonin + Acetyl-CoA → N-Acetylserotonin )<br>        2. Methylation (N-Acetylserotonin → Melatonin )<br>- Frequent physiological calcifications|
|Area pretectalis|- Location: Above the Superior colliculi<br>- Nuclei: Pretectal nuclei<br>    - Afferents: "Optic tract" from the Retina<br>    - Efferents: Ipsilateral and contralateral Accessory nucleus of oculomotor nerve (Edinger-Westphal nucleus)|- Circuitry of the Pupil reflex (Pupil constriction in response to incoming light)|
|Habenula|- Connects the epiphysis with the thalamus<br>- Nuclei: Ncll. habenulares (medial and lateral)<br>    - Commissura habenularum: Connection between the Ncll. habenulares of both sides<br>- Connected to the stria medullaris thalami with the Ncll. septales| Relay station for olfactory impulses|
|Posterior commissure|- Fiber tracts that contain the fibers of the quadrigeminal plate, the pretectal area, and the mesencephalic tegmentum<br>- Location: At the roof of the aqueduct of the mesencephalon|- Connection of various mesencephalic and diencephalic nuclei|
## Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the central control center for many vital vegetative functions, such as circulation, breathing, body temperature, food intake, and sexual behavior. It consists of three core groups located at the base of the third ventricle. The nuclei of the hypothalamus have extensive fiber connections (efferent and afferent) to the limbic system. In addition, they receive many afferents from sensitive centers of the CNS and send efferents mainly to visceromotor nuclei.

### Profile

- Function: The most important control center of the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system.
- Location: Below the third ventricle in the diencephalon
- Division: Three core groups
    - Anterior (rostal) Kerngruppe
    - Intermediate core group
    - Posterior core group

### Anatomy

The hypothalamus forms the base of the third ventricle. It consists of three core groups, each containing several nuclei. These form externally visible structures.

- Extern visible structures (from back to front)
    - Mammillary bodies
    - Tuber cinereum
    - Infundibulum and Neurohypophysis
- Topographical relationship: Cranial: III. Ventricle

#### Important Hypothalamic Nuclei

| |   |Location|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|Anterior nucleus group|Ncl. supraopticus|- Above the optic tract|- Production of ADH and little oxytocin|
|Ncl. paraventricularis|- Lateral wall of the third ventricle|- Production of oxytocin and little ADH<br>- Production of CRH (small cell component)<br>- Involved in the regulation of<br>    - Circulation<br>    - Thermal balance (thermoregulation)<br>    - Food intake|
|Ncl. suprachiasmaticus|- Above the optic chiasm|- Pacemaker for the circadian rhythm ("internal clock")|
|Ncll. praeoptici|- In front of the Ncl. paraventricularis|- Thermoregulation<br>- Regulation of sexual function|
|Central Core Group|Ncl. arcuatus (Hypothalamus)|- In the tuber cinereum|- Produces Releasing Hormone for the Adenohypophysis (GnRH, CRH and TRH as well as Dopamine and Somatostatin)<br>- Regulation of food intake|
|Nodular tubers|
|Ncl. tuberomamillaris|- Caudal of the mamillary bodies|- Circadian rhythm|
|Posterior core group (Ncll. Corpora mamillaria)|   |- Part of the Corpora mamillaria|- Component of the Papez circuit<br>    - Learning processes and memory formation<br>- Influence on sexual behavior|

> [!NOTE]
> The Ncl. tuberomamillaris is the only nucleus of the central nervous system that contains histaminergic neurons. Its primary function is the arousal response. A typical side effect of antihistaminic medications is therefore drowsiness!

> [!NOTE] Korsakow Syndrome
> In cases of chronic alcohol abuse, the destruction of brain cells occurs over time. The corpora mamillaria are often affected early, playing an important role in memory formation. This leads to amnesia (impaired memory) and confabulations (the telling of objectively false statements). The resulting syndrome is referred to as the “Korsakoff syndrome” (named after the Russian psychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff) or “amnestic psychosis.”

### Functions of the Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is the most important control center of the autonomic nervous system and is often referred to as the "interior ministry of the body." It has numerous fiber connections to other brain centers, such as the limbic system, forms the releasing hormones for the hormones of the adenohypophysis (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) and produces its own hormones, which are stored in the neurohypophysis and released into the blood as needed.

- Thermoregulation (Preoptic Nuclei): see Energy and Heat Balance
- Regulation of the water balance (Ncl. paraventricularis and Ncl. supraopticus): see pituitary gland
- Regulation of Food Intake (Ncl. arcuatus and Ncl. paraventricularis):
    - Process
        - When fat stores are full, leptin is released by the adipose tissue → Leptin inhibits the release of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus, thereby reducing hunger
        - The Ncl. arcuatus acts inhibitory on the Ncl. paraventricularis via neuropeptide Y and thus increases hunger.
        - The Ncl. paraventricularis inhibits the feeling of hunger.
- Regulation of the circadian rhythm (Ncl. tuberomammilaris and Ncl. suprachiasmaticus)
    - Process
        - Ncl. tuberomamillaris: Produces histamine and orexin → Increase in attention
        - Ncl. suprachiasmaticus: Receives afferents from the retina and stimulates the release of melatonin from the pineal gland
- Regulation of sexual behavior (Ncl. praeopticus, Ncll. corpora mamillaria and Ncl. paraventricularis)
    - Process
        - Ncl. paraventricularis: Produces Oxytocin → Is released with every form of pleasant skin contact (e.g., during breastfeeding through sucking at the nipple or while cuddling) → Influences, among other things, the partner or parent-child relationship (see: Pituitary gland)
        - Ncll. mammillary nuclei and Ncl. preoptic: Regulate/Influence sexual desire and behavior

> [!NOTE] Diabetes insipidus
> If the Ncl. supraopticus is damaged, for example, by a tumor, insufficient ADH is produced. As a result, there is a significantly reduced water reabsorption in the kidney: Affected individuals excrete up to 20 liters of urine per day. This urine is poorly concentrated and therefore highly diluted, which also explains the name (Greek insipidus = "without taste"). Therapeutically, synthetic ADH can be administered for this form of diabetes insipidus, and the underlying cause should also be sought and treated.

## Review Questions on the Diencephalon Chapter
### Thalamus

What function do nonspecific thalamic nuclei have? Which nuclei do you know?
- Nonspecific thalamic nuclei do not project to a specific area of the cerebral cortex, but nonspecifically to various regions and are part of the regulation of consciousness. They include the Ncl. centromedianus as well as the other intralaminar nuclei and the Ncl. reticularis.

### Subthalamus

The subthalamus can be divided into which parts?
- The subthalamus consists of the Ncl. subthalamicus and the Globus pallidus, both of which functionally belong to the basal ganglia.

### Metathalamus

What parts make up the metathalamus? What functions do they have?
- The metathalamus consists of the paired corpora geniculata laterale and mediale. The corpora geniculata laterale are part of the visual pathway; the corpora geniculata mediale are part of the auditory pathway.

### Epithalamus

Explain the biosynthesis of melatonin!
- Melatonin is synthesized in the epithalamus in two steps. First, an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA is attached to the first amino group of serotonin, forming N-acetylserotonin (Serotonin + N-Acetyl-CoA → N-Acetylserotonin). This reaction is light-dependent. In the second step, N-acetylserotonin is methylated, resulting in melatonin.

Which peripheral ganglion does the pineal gland receive afferents from?
- The pineal gland receives, in a complex circuit, among others, sympathetic efferents from the superior cervical ganglion.

### Hypothalamus

Where is the suprachiasmatic nucleus located? What function does it have?
- The Ncl. suprachiasmaticus is part of the anterior group of nuclei of the hypothalamus and serves as the pacemaker for the circadian rhythm (“internal clock”). It receives light-dark information from ganglion cells of the retina and leads to the release of melatonin from the pineal gland.

Which hormones are produced in the arcuate nucleus (Ncl. arcuatus)?
- The Ncl. arcuatus belongs to the middle group of nuclei of the hypothalamus and produces releasing hormones for the adenohypophysis: GnRH, CRH, TRH, somatostatin, and dopamine. Additionally, it regulates food intake via neuropeptide Y (NPY).
