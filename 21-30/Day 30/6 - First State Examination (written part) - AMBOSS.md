# First State Examination (written part)
## Summary

The first state examination of the medical studies (also commonly referred to as the "Physikum") is held in the form of a written and an oral examination. This chapter provides you with fundamental information about the process of the written examination. Tips for preparation and approach in the oral examination can be found in the chapter First State Examination (oral part).

THE AMBOSS TEAM WISHES YOU MUCH SUCCESS ON THE EXAM!!!

### What can I expect in the written exam?

The written part of the first section of the medical examination is taken every year in March and August by about 5000 medical students. The exam consists of a total of 320 questions. Spread over two exam days, this results in 160 questions per day. You will have four hours available for answering them. That is a long time and requires good management of concentration, but most students manage their time well and even have time left over at the end. On average, one and a half minutes are available for each question, but many of them you will be able to solve in less than a minute.

The number of questions per subject is the same for each exam. 100 questions are posed from the fields of anatomy and biology, 80 questions from physiology and physics, 80 questions from chemistry and biochemistry, and 60 questions from psychology and sociology.
## How does the exam day proceed?

The exam starts at 9 AM. However, it is important to arrive at least half an hour earlier so that you can register for the exam calmly. You will need the letter of summons from the State Examination Office (LPA) and a photo ID for this.

Your bag should be placed outside or far from your seat, but you are allowed to have a small snack and a drink at your seat. It's worth it to recharge your energy resources from time to time!

Generally, it is important to maintain the greatest possible silence during the exam so that each participant can concentrate as well as possible. Therefore, for example, it is considerate to wear shoes that are quiet when walking to avoid distracting your fellow students. Those who are very sensitive to noise can also bring earplugs or similar items. Regarding clothing choice: opt for comfortable clothing in which you can work concentrated for four hours. You should feel as comfortable as possible and not try out unfamiliar things on that day (e.g., new perfume or deodorant) in order to concentrate well. A dress code only becomes relevant during the oral exam.

9:00 AM Exam Start: Depending on the location, a pencil and an eraser will be provided by the state examination office or must be brought by yourself (see the notice of summons from the LPA). You will receive a task booklet, an image supplement, and an answer sheet. The name, exam number, and group ("A" or "B") should be checked on the answer sheet. From now on, you have four hours. Remember: You have prepared well, and you will succeed!

The organization of breaks and the restroom policy vary from place to place. There is theoretically no limit on the length of break times. If you finish earlier, you may submit the answer sheet before the four hours are up. Only in the last half hour of the exam time is the room typically not allowed to be exited, to avoid disturbances. After each exam day, you can also take your question booklet home. If you left the room early, you can pick up your booklet at 1 PM, the official end of the exam period. If you want to compare your answers later, write them down in your exam booklet.

> [!NOTE]
> On the first day, the subjects of Physiology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Physics will be tested, and on the second day, the subjects of Anatomy, Psychology, Biology, and Sociology will be examined!

## Learning between the days?

After the first exam day, you may also be confronted with some of your fellow students saying that they are still studying anatomy in the afternoon, as it "comes up on the second day." Here, the principle applies again: Do what calms you! If it reassures you to review a few things for your short-term memory and you gain that “last assurance,” it is fine. Just don’t let too much of the valuable recovery time between the two exam days be taken away. You need your full concentration again the next day. Ultimately, the rule is: You have prepared thoroughly and properly for the exam, so try not to stress too much! From our experience, pure factual knowledge alone is often not enough to solve many questions; it requires sufficient attention and comprehension to derive the correct solution. You can only achieve this through adequate recovery phases. Studying between the days to randomly answer a factual question from the short-term memory must therefore be weighed against the necessary recovery.
## Compare the solutions on the internet?

After the exam days, it is possible to enter your own solutions on the internet and have them compared. At the end of the day, you can already get an approximate result. This has its pros and cons, and everyone must also find out for themselves how they feel most comfortable.

PRO results check

- Can give you reassurance for the upcoming exam day and calm your nerves.
- Can strengthen you in your cross methods, for example, when you were right with your gut feeling on new, complicated questions.
- Calms and dispels any potential bad feeling when the result turns out to be much better in the end than initially thought. In our experience, people tend to underestimate their results more often than they overestimate them.
- Can take stress off for the second day: “I already have enough buffer that 50% is enough for me to pass.”

Check CONTRA results

- It may confuse and emotionally stress you a lot, and the valuable recovery time between exam days is lost.
- Can increase stress on the last day: If I want to achieve my desired grade, I have to mark XY% on the second day!
## The Written Grade

Your own results will be sent to you by mail from the state examination office in the weeks following the exam. It is not possible to predict exactly how many points are necessary to pass. The passing threshold is determined by the results of the reference group. This includes all first-time candidates of the exam with standard study duration. The passing threshold is calculated based on their average performance. It is at 60% or slightly below, depending on how the exam goes. If the exam is more difficult, the passing threshold is lower. However, even if it is an exam that yields good results, the passing threshold remains at 60% and will not be raised.

Disadvantage compensation: By questions that are excluded from scoring, the maximum possible score is reduced and your average improves. If you answered the excluded question correctly, you do not lose the point. In such a case, your grade average is calculated based on more overall questions. But don't worry: The evaluation and calculation are automated by the IMPP, so there are no errors or unequal treatments.

The grades for the oral and written parts are each calculated at 50 percent to form a final grade. At the end of the studies, the grades from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sections of the Medical Examination are added together, and the total is divided by three. The overall grade is calculated to two decimal places. The overall grade of your medical studies is then composed of ⅓ from the grade of the 1st section and ⅔ from the grades of the 2nd and 3rd sections.
