# Prevention and Health Promotion
## Summary

In addition to treating and curing diseases, promoting and maintaining health are also among the tasks of physicians and the healthcare system. Through preventive measures, the aim is to prevent the onset of diseases, detect diseases at an early stage, and minimize the consequences of an already existing disease. This chapter explains the different forms of prevention, presents some theories and models of the respective forms of prevention, and outlines preventive measures of the German healthcare system.
## Overview of Prevention Methods

The term prevention (from Latin praevenire = to come before, to prevent) encompasses concepts, strategies, and measures aimed at preventing the onset of diseases, detecting diseases early, and minimizing the consequences of an already existing disease.

#### Behavioral and Relationship Prevention

Basically, two starting points of prevention can be distinguished.

- Behavioral prevention
    - Function: Promotion of healthy behaviors of an individual
    - Target audience: General population
    - Example: Offering back exercise courses, providing information brochures, social marketing (using various media such as poster, television, or internet advertising for smoking prevention)
- Relationship Prevention
    - Function: Improvement of living conditions and health-promoting design of the environment for people
    - Target audience: General population
    - Example: Seat belt requirement in cars, smoking bans in public buildings, iodization of table salt

> [!NOTE]
> The combination of behavioral and situational preventive measures promises greater success than the sole implementation of either of the two measures!

### Universal, selective, and indexed prevention

- Universal Prevention
    - Target group: General population or large subpopulations
    - Example: Information on protection against sexually transmitted infections
- Selective Prevention
    - Target group: Suspected at-risk individuals
    - Example: Specific awareness campaigns for sexually active individuals with potentially risky behavior
- Indexed Prevention
    - Target group: Secured risk individuals
    - Example: Promotion of condom use among HIV-infected individuals

### Paradox of Prevention

- Preventive measures that can benefit a large group often provide little or no personal advantage to the individual.
- Preventive measures that may benefit a small group have only a minor positive impact on the larger group.
## Preventive Measures

Preventive measures are intended to influence people's everyday health and illness behavior.

### Measures of primary prevention

Primary prevention measures aim to reduce risk factors and prevent the onset of a disease, for example, through vaccinations or changes in lifestyle (smoking cessation, dietary changes, dental care, etc.). To change lifestyles, the settings approach has proven to be particularly helpful.

- Setting-Approach
    - Goal: Behavior change in everyday life
    - Properties
        - The target group is approached in their environment (setting) and addressed precisely.
        - Enables more sustainable successes than general campaigns
        - Facilitates the consideration of barriers that hinder health-promoting behavior
    - Example: Yoga classes during lunch breaks for office workers to prevent back pain

### Measures of secondary prevention

Secondary prevention measures aim to detect diseases early, prevent their development in the presence of risk factors, and prevent disease recurrences. This is achieved, for example, through screening measures, lifestyle recommendations, and medication therapies.

- Screening measures
    - Goal: Recognizing diseases in treatable early stages
        - Screening measures are effective when early diagnosis prolongs survival time and/or improves quality of life.
    - Example: Colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening
    - Requirements for the use of screening measures
        - The condition in question should be common and have serious consequences.
        - Presence of a suitable screening test
        - Presence of an effective and recognized therapy in early stages
    - Risks of screening examinations
        - Overdiagnosis
        - False-positive findings
        - False-negative findings
        - Example: The screening test for prostate-specific antigen prevents death from prostate cancer in 3 out of 1,000 men. For the remaining 997 men, the test has no benefit regarding mortality. In contrast, there are risks: the test often yields false positives or sometimes leads to the diagnosis of a prostate cancer that would not have caused any problems for the affected individuals during their lifetime.
    - In order to adequately assess the implementation and results of screening measures, it is necessary to understand some epidemiological terms and their meanings. For example, the benefit of a screening test is greater the higher the prevalence of the screened disease is. For other important epidemiological terms, see: Health and Disease and Medical Statistics and Test Theory.

### Measures of tertiary prevention

Tertiary prevention measures aim to prevent the worsening of an already existing condition and minimize the occurrence of subsequent damage, thus alleviating the course of the disease (e.g., physical activity for nonspecific back pain).

#### Sociotherapy

The goal of sociotherapy is to improve the continued treatment, aftercare, and reintegration of individuals with severe mental illnesses.

- Concept for supporting individuals with severe mental illnesses through motivational work and structured training measures
- Support in the coordination and utilization of services within the healthcare system
- Assistance in addressing psychosocial problems of this patient group

#### Support Groups

Self-help groups are intended to assist chronically ill individuals in coping with their illness and behaving in a supportive manner, for example, to avoid relapse in the context of addiction. Self-help groups are characterized by the following features:

- Voluntary, regular meetings of those affected
- Leadership of the group by an affected person
- Support for coping with the illness and its consequences
    - Provision of information on illness and everyday assistance (informational support)
    - Experience exchange
    - Emotional Support
- Public Relations
- Recruitment of patient representatives from self-help groups who represent the interests of those affected before the healthcare system.

#### Patient Education

Patient education (also referred to in cognitive behavioral therapy as “psychoeducation”) is aimed at individuals with chronic illnesses. In this context, patients receive information about their condition and its treatment, along with guidance on behaviors and skills that are actively practiced for integration into daily life. The everyday experiences of the patients and their personal goals are always taken into account.

- Components of Patient Education
    - Conveying information about the illness and its treatment
    - Learning skills for self-diagnosis and self-treatment
    - Motivation to reduce risk factors and improve lifestyle
    - Stress management training
    - Training of Social Skills
    - Psychological support
- Applied didactic approaches
    - Structured presentations
    - Group discussions
    - Practical exercise of skills
    - Learning Objective Assessments

#### Rehabilitation

With the help of rehabilitation measures, patients are to be enabled to return to their normal daily lives and participate in professional and social life. Depending on the employment relationship and the reason for the rehabilitation, the rehabilitation measures are covered by various payers.

- Rehabilitation measures: Aim at changing lifestyle, well-being, quality of life as well as professional and social integration; these include, among others,
    - Patient Education
    - Movement therapy
    - Help with reintegration into work and society
    - Job-related training (e.g. stress training at workplaces)
- Rehabilitation providers in Germany
    - Statutory Pension Insurance: Pays if early retirement can be prevented through the rehabilitation measure.
    - Statutory Accident Insurance: Pays if the effects of a work accident or an occupational disease can be mitigated through rehabilitation measures.
    - Statutory Health Insurance: Pays when neither the statutory Pension Insurance nor the statutory Accident Insurance is responsible.
    - Federal Employment Agency: Pays if the rehabilitation measure can improve or restore the ability to work

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to the cure, where the measures are rather passive (e.g. healing springs, massages), rehabilitation measures are characterized by the active participation of the patients!

> [!NOTE] Rehabilitation Application
> Many patients can benefit from rehabilitation following a hospital stay. For this, a rehabilitation application must be filled out by the medical staff. The forms differ depending on the cost bearer, which is why it is quite relevant in practice to be familiar with the rehabilitation providers!

##### ICF Classification

Since the extent of functional impairment due to a disease varies individually, the WHO has established an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) in addition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems). This is applied in the context of rehabilitation measures.

- Short description: Standardized classification issued by the WHO to describe a person's functional health status, disability, social impairment, and relevant environmental factors.
- The following components are taken into account
    - Body functions and structures (formerly: Impairment): Extent of impairments at the physical and mental level
    - Activity (formerly: Disability): Extent of the ability to participate in daily life
    - Participation (formerly: Handicap): Extent of the ability to practice one's profession and thus participate in society.
    - Contextual factors in a person and their environment

### Care for Those in Need of Assistance

Most care-recipients are cared for by their relatives, which is usually associated with a significant emotional and physical burden. The need for care is assessed based on limitations in the activities of daily living. After classification into one of the five care levels, the extent of care services can be determined. All of this is carried out by the Medical Service of Health Insurance (MDK).

- Classification of care services into three groups
    - Treatment care: Care services as part of medical treatment
    - Basic care: Care services to assist with the management of daily living activities
    - Household support: Services for maintaining independent household management
- Assessment of care needs based on limitations in activities of daily living in the following six areas of life (so-called modules)
    1. Mobility
    2. Cognitive and communicative skills
    3. Behaviors and psychological issues
    4. Self-sufficiency
    5. Dealing with illness and therapy requirements
    6. Design of everyday life and social contacts

> [!NOTE] Care levels instead of Care stages
> Since January 2017, the classification of care dependency has been made into five care levels instead of three care stages. The aim is primarily to reflect the support needs of those in need of care (including children) by incorporating cognitive and psychological impairments. Since 2017, physical, cognitive, and psychological limitations have been equally considered in the assessment of care dependency. The previous assessment instrument only recorded limitations in activities of daily living in four areas: personal hygiene, nutrition, mobility, and domestic care. Additionally, care level 1 is new and is intended to support individuals who previously did not meet the criteria for a care stage. They do not receive care benefits; however, they do receive a relief amount for care or care services. For the conversion of the previous care stages, see also: care levels.

> [!NOTE]
> The number of people in need of care in Germany is continuously increasing. In 2010, there were about 2.5 million, while in 2021 there were already 4.96 million people in need of care! The change in the definition of care needs in 2017 has led to an above-average increase in the numbers.

## Health Behavior and Models of Health-Related Behavior

Over time, in addition to the question of risk factors in the sense of classical prevention, the question of health promotion factors has increasingly been raised. In this context, various concepts and models of health-relevant behavior have been developed, which partially overlap and complement each other and will be presented in the following.

- Protective factors: Personal or environmental factors that make the occurrence of health disorders or diseases less likely (e.g. optimistic outlook on life or social support)
- Resilience (resistance, psychological elasticity, adaptability): A person's ability to endure life events or illnesses without long-term impairment due to their mental or physical resilience.
- Model of salutogenesis
    - Engages with the question of why some people remain healthy despite adverse conditions.
    - Aims at health promotion, not disease prevention.
    - Important health-promoting factors
        1. Individual resistance resources (e.g., intelligence, social support)
        2. Sense of coherence (see table)

|Sense of coherence within the framework of the salutogenic model|   |
|---|---|
|Meaningfulness|The feeling that it is worth making an effort and investing energy|
|Manageability|The feeling of having adequate resources to cope with life events|
|Understandability|The feeling that life events do not happen randomly, but are predictable|

### Continuous Models of Health-Related Behavior

The following models are continuous models. They assume that the probability of exhibiting a health-promoting behavior increases or decreases continuously, depending on the strength of the respective influencing factors.

### Stage Models of Health-Relevant Behavior

The following models are stage models. They assume that individuals undergo qualitatively different stages on the path to a lasting behavior change. The models take into account, in particular, that the intention to perform a behavior and the actual execution of it can be quite far apart (the so-called intention-behavior gap). In the context of measures for prevention and health promotion (e.g., medical consultations), it should be considered in which stage the patients are and which influencing factors are primarily at play.

#### Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change

- The following stages are traversed by individuals who want to change their behavior, according to the model, with measures and support offers tailored to the current stage.
    - Unintentionality (Precontemplation): The person is not yet aware of their problematic behavior or does not want to acknowledge it.
    - Awareness (Intent Formation, Contemplation): The person becomes aware of their problematic behavior and weighs the pros and cons of changing their behavior.
    - Preparation: The person plans their behavior change
    - Action: The person implements the desired behavior change.
    - Maintenance: The desired behavior is maintained, setbacks are endured.
    - Stabilization: The desired behavior is maintained over several years and thus becomes a habit.

#### Social-Cognitive Process Model of Health Behavior

- The following phases will be passed through in order.
    - Motivational Phase: Formation of Intention
    - Volitional Phase: Divided into
        - A pre-action phase (= concrete planning of the action)
        - An action phase (= execution and maintenance of the action)
        - A post-action phase (= action evaluation, reflection on success or failure, and if necessary, restoration of behavior after relapses or deviation from the goal)

> [!NOTE]
> The self-efficacy expectation, also known as competence expectation, is a central component of most models, and this applies to all stages of behavior change. This term expresses the extent to which a person is convinced that they can perform a behavior even against resistance!

### Points of Departure and Target Groups of Health Promotion

Health promotion includes all activities aimed at improving health. It can address health behavior on various levels (individually or structurally) and target different populations. The social environment, with its attitudes, norms, and behavior models, always plays an important role in this.

- Structural health promotion: The goal is to improve health-related living and working conditions (= change of the living environment), among other things, by
    - Smoking ban in the workplace
    - Healthy food choices in the staff cafeteria
    - Ergonomic workstations
    - Reduction of pollutant exposure
- Individual health promotion: The goal is to improve individual health-related behaviors (i.e., behavior changes), e.g. through
    - Stress management courses
    - Smoking cessation programs
    - Sports courses
- Target group: A group of people with common characteristics (e.g. age, gender, consumption habits) and life situations (e.g. social environment, income) to which health promotion offers and measures are specifically directed.
- Multipliers: Individuals or institutions that convey health-promoting measures to target groups.
    - Institutions that design broad health promotion measures (so-called senders) often have limited direct access to target groups. For successful implementation of the measures, it requires individuals who come into contact with many people, enjoy credibility and acceptance among the target group, and are competent in conveying health-related knowledge.

#### Special Features in Adolescence

- Adolescents, on average, show a higher willingness to take risks (e.g., binge drinking, unprotected sex)
- The influence of social factors on health behavior is particularly significant in adolescence.
- Negative influences on the health behavior of adolescents are mainly
    - Individual crises of self-esteem
    - Individual personality traits such as a tendency towards risky behavior
    - Harmful influences from belonging to a peer group
    - Insufficient integration into society

> [!NOTE]
> Changing one's lifestyle can be a significant challenge. Health-damaging behaviors are partly encouraged by social factors and have often already become a habit, which is frequently associated with (short-term) stress reduction!

### Theory of Cognitive Dissonance

There is often a discrepancy between attitudes and behavior. How people confront this discrepancy is explained by the theory of cognitive dissonance. Since the success of preventive measures is often impaired by the contradiction between attitudes and behavior, the theory of cognitive dissonance is particularly significant in this area.

- A contradiction between behavior and attitude creates an uncomfortable state of tension (feeling of cognitive dissonance)
- Strategies for resolving the state of tension
    - Change of attitude
    - Adding new thoughts to justify the behavior
    - Hiding inconsistent information
## Review Questions on the Chapter Prevention and Health Promotion
### Overview of Prevention Methods

What is meant by primary prevention?
- Primary prevention includes measures to prevent the onset of diseases in healthy individuals. These include, among others, vaccinations or a health-conscious change in lifestyle (e.g., smoking cessation, taking up sports activities).
What is meant by secondary prevention?
- Secondary prevention includes measures for early detection of diseases and for preventing both diseases in at-risk individuals and disease recurrences. These especially include screening examinations (e.g., colorectal cancer screening, screening for early detection of breast cancer).
What is meant by tertiary prevention?
- Tertiary prevention includes measures to prevent consequential damage and worsening of an existing disease; it therefore applies to individuals who are already ill. Rehabilitative measures are a typical example of tertiary prevention.
Explain the two terms behavior and ratio prevention!
- While primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention refer to the target group (healthy individuals, at-risk persons, or those already ill), behavioral and ratio prevention describe two different approaches to preventive measures: Behavioral prevention is a collective term for strategies that aim to influence the individual health behavior and lifestyle of persons (e.g., educational measures on healthy nutrition, displaying informational brochures, social marketing). Ratio prevention (also called structural prevention) includes measures that change living, working, and environmental conditions to reduce or eliminate health hazards for the general population. These are often decisions and regulations at the political or societal level, such as iodization of table salt to prevent iodine deficiency or the legal seatbelt requirement in motor vehicles.
### Preventive Measures

What is meant by the setting approach?
- The setting approach is a measure of primary prevention aimed at changing everyday habits. It is characterized by directly approaching and precisely addressing the target group in their living environment (setting) (e.g., stress management training at the workplace).
What goal does rehabilitation pursue and what measures should be taken to achieve this goal?
- Rehabilitation aims to enable the reintegration of patients into professional and social life. Positive changes regarding lifestyle, well-being, and quality of life should be achieved through patient education, physical therapy, and job-specific training. Unlike a simple spa stay, rehabilitation measures require active participation of the patients.
What goal is pursued with patient education and what special emphasis is placed on during its implementation?
- Patient education takes place in the context of tertiary prevention and thus aims to alleviate disease progression, for example by minimizing consequential damage from chronic diseases. Patients are motivated to actively acquire knowledge about their illness and how to manage it. The focus is therefore on measures such as interactive group discussions and practical exercises of skills involving the patients’ personal goals and everyday experiences.
What is the special characteristic of self-help groups?
- Self-help groups are voluntary, regular meetings of patients, organized by themselves. Physicians may participate in an advisory role, but self-help groups are not under professional medical supervision.
What is meant by patient representatives?
- Patient representatives are patients themselves who are involved in decision-making processes in the healthcare system and represent the interests of patients at federal and state levels. They are mostly recruited from self-help groups.
Which patient group is the sociotherapy aimed at and what is its objective?
- Sociotherapy is an offering of tertiary prevention aimed at severely mentally ill patients. These individuals often have difficulties participating in social life and accessing healthcare services. Sociotherapy is intended to help them better manage ongoing treatment, aftercare, and reintegration into society.
Approximately how many people are currently in need of care in Germany, and which working group is responsible for their classification?
- According to the Social Code (SGB), persons in need of care are those who, due to a “physical, mental, or emotional illness or disability, require help for the usual and regularly recurring tasks in daily life on a permanent basis, expectedly for at least six months” (quote: Federal Statistical Office). In 2010, there were about 2.5 million such people in Germany. By 2021, nearly 5 million, with the change in terminology to care dependency in 2017 leading to a sharp rise in the numbers. Classification into one of the five care levels is carried out by the Medical Service of the Health Insurance (MDK).
What aspects are covered by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)?
- The ICF classification serves to describe a person’s functional health status, disability, social impairment, and relevant environmental factors. It considers the extent of impairments on physical and psychological levels (= body functions and structures), the extent of ability to participate in everyday life (= activity) and society (= participation), as well as contextual factors within the person and their environment. Disease diagnoses are not components of the ICF because a diagnosis alone cannot provide general statements about the limitations of the respective patients.
### Health Behavior and Models of Health-Relevant Behavior

What is meant by resilience?
- The term “resilience” refers to a person’s resistance and thus their ability to withstand critical life events or illnesses without long-term impairment due to their psychological or physical resilience.
Describe the model of salutogenesis!
- The salutogenesis model deals with the question of why people stay healthy despite unfavorable conditions. The focus is not on disease prevention but on health promotion. Health-promoting factors include, on the one hand, individual resistance resources (e.g., intelligence, good immune system, intact social network) and, on the other hand, the sense of coherence. This consists of the following three components: meaningfulness (the feeling that it is worthwhile to commit to something), manageability (the feeling of having sufficient resources), and comprehensibility (the feeling that life events do not happen arbitrarily).
What is meant by the Health Belief Model?
- The Health Belief Model belongs to the continuous models of health-relevant behavior, which assume that the probability of performing a preventive or health-promoting behavior increases or decreases continuously depending on how strongly the respective influencing factors are developed. It describes how health-related perceptions and beliefs influence health behavior. According to the model, a behavior change becomes more likely when the respective disease is perceived as threatening, the person sees themselves as vulnerable, there is an expectation that the preventive behavior is effective, and no insurmountable barriers stand in the way.
What is meant by the Theory of Planned Behavior?
- The Theory of Planned Behavior also belongs to the continuous models of health-relevant behavior. It assumes that behavior is directly determined by intention and describes the factors contributing to intention formation. Unlike the Health Belief Model, not only one’s own attitudes but also the expectations of the social environment (subjective norm) are significant here. Whether a planned behavior change is actually implemented depends on perceived behavioral control, i.e., whether a possible behavior change appears feasible.
What is meant by self-efficacy or self-efficacy expectation?
- Self-efficacy or self-efficacy expectation describes the assessment of one’s own competence to perform a desired or health-promoting behavior even under adverse circumstances. An example would be the assessment by a person affected by obesity of whether they let rainy weather deter them from their jogging program. High self-efficacy would exist if the person answers this question with a clear “no.”
What is understood by the transtheoretical model of behavior change?
- The transtheoretical model of behavior change belongs to stage models of health-relevant behavior. It describes a behavior change in six different stages that a person passes through on the way to the desired behavior. While the person in the first stage of problem behavior (e.g., smoking) is not yet aware of it, in the second stage they already know the advantages and disadvantages of a behavior change. The next stages range from preparation through concrete action and maintenance to stabilization of the behavior. Depending on which stage the patients are in, physicians should apply different intervention strategies to support them as well as possible.
Describe the process model of health-related actions!
- The process model of health-related actions (also called the “Health Action Process Approach” or “HAPA”) belongs to stage models of health-relevant behavior. First, in the motivational phase, the intention to change behavior is formed (and, for example, to start regular physical training). The following volitional phase (volitional = determined by will) is divided into three further phases: In the pre-action phase, the action is planned (e.g., developing a concrete training plan), in the action phase the plan is ideally successfully implemented. Finally, in the post-action phase, an evaluation of the action takes place and the behavior is adjusted if necessary.
Name a few examples of both structural and individual health promotion!
- Individual health promotion aims to improve health-relevant behaviors (e.g., stress management and sports courses, smoking cessation programs), while structural health promotion includes improvement of health-relevant living and working conditions (e.g., healthy food in the cafeteria, smoking ban at the workplace).
What is meant by multipliers?
- In the context of health promotion, persons are called multipliers who come into contact with many people, enjoy credibility and acceptance, and have competence in imparting health-relevant knowledge. An example would be (competent) teachers who teach their students knowledge about safe contraception.
Name some factors that influence health-damaging behavior in adolescence!
- Factors that influence health-damaging behavior in adolescence include, among others, individual crises of self-esteem, individual personality traits (e.g., a tendency towards risky behavior), harmful influences due to belonging to a peer group, as well as insufficient integration into society.
Explain the theory of cognitive dissonance using an example!
- The theory of cognitive dissonance assumes that people try to achieve the greatest possible consistency between their attitudes and behavior. However, these often contradict each other and those affected then experience an uncomfortable state of tension called cognitive dissonance. A classic example is the smoker who knows that smoking harms their health but does not quit nonetheless. To resolve the uncomfortable state of cognitive dissonance, either the behavior or the attitudes must be changed. Since changing behavior (quitting smoking) is usually more difficult and effortful, those affected tend to change their attitudes instead. For example, a smoker thinks of their grandfather, who despite heavy smoking lived to be 80 years old, or justifies their health-damaging behavior with the attitude that they would rather live shorter and enjoyably than longer and boringly.
