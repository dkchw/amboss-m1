# Cholesterol
## Summary

Cholesterol is a polycyclic alcohol from the steroid group, which in turn belongs to the isoprenoid lipids. Cholesterol plays an important role in the organism as a membrane component; it is embedded in the lipid bilayer of all cell membranes and increases their fluidity and stability. Furthermore, it serves as a precursor for the synthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids.

In the digestive tract, cholesterol, like all lipids, is absorbed after micelle formation. Also, in other parts of the body, cholesterol must be "packaged" for transport processes due to its apolarity: In the blood, lipoproteins serve as transport vehicles, while in bile, bile acids or again micelles are used.

Cholesterol is not only absorbed through food but is also synthesized by the body. Acetyl-CoA, which is generated sufficiently in metabolism, serves as the starting material. The key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis is HMG-CoA reductase. This enzyme is also clinically significant, as it is the target for medications designed to lower plasma cholesterol levels (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins).

## Chemical Structure of Isoprenolipids

The basic building block of isoprenoids is isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). Through the condensation of multiple isoprene units, isoprenoids are formed, such as terpenes and steroids.

- Terpene: Chain-like molecules that are formed by the polymerization of at least two isoprene molecules.
    - Monoterpene: Compounds made up of 10 carbon atoms that are formed by the condensation of two isoprene molecules.
    - Diterpene: C20 compounds
    - Triterpene: C30 compounds
    - Sesquiterpene: C15 compounds; are derived from three isoprene molecules.
- Steroids: Formed by cyclization of the triterpene squalene
    - The most important steroid is cholesterol.

## Digestion, Absorption, Transport, and Excretion

### Digestion and Absorption of Cholesterol

Cholesterol is usually present in food esterified with fatty acids. These cholesterol esters must be broken down and absorbed after micelle formation.

- Digestion
    - Cholesterol esterase
        - Catalyzed reaction: Cholesterol ester → Cholesterol + free fatty acid
        - Cofactor: Bile acids
- Resorption
    - Micelle formation, among other things, with bile acids in the lumen of the small intestine.
    - After the disintegration of the micelles at the brush border membrane, uptake into the enterocytes occurs via the Niemann-Pick-C1 like 1 protein (NPC1L1 protein).
- Further processing: Re-esterification in the cytosol of enterocytes and incorporation into chylomicrons

> [!NOTE]
> Cholesterol can only be absorbed in unesterified form and in the presence of bile acids!

> [!NOTE] Cholestasis
> A deficiency of bile acids in the intestinal lumen can lead to malabsorption of lipids. This deficiency is often caused by reduced bile flow (cholestasis). This can be caused, for example, by gallstones or a tumor of the bile ducts!

### Transport and Excretion of Cholesterol

Since cholesterol is apolar, it must be converted into a water-soluble form for transport within the body. Depending on the transport route, there are different mechanisms for this:

- Transport in the bile
    - As cholesterol: Together with lecithin and bile acids in the form of water-soluble micelles
    - As bile acid
- Transport in the blood
    - The transport of cholesterol in the blood occurs via lipoproteins.
        - Transport from the intestine to the liver: Together with TAGs in chylomicrons or chylomicron remnants
        - Transport from the liver to the tissues: Via VLDL and LDL
        - Transport from the tissues to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport): Via HDL and IDL
            - Previously, export of cholesterol from the cells via ATP-dependent transport protein ABCA1
- Excretion: The sterol skeleton of cholesterol can be built up by the body but cannot be broken down again. Cholesterol is therefore excreted through the bile as a whole molecule or modified in the form of bile acids.

> [!NOTE] Cholelithiasis
> The composition of the micelles in the bile may only fluctuate within very narrow limits. If the equilibrium shifts in favor of cholesterol, it leads to the precipitation of cholesterol crystals. This is a possible formation mechanism of gallstones (cholelithiasis).

## Cholesterol Biosynthesis

- Definition: Endogenous synthesis of cholesterol from simple precursors.
- Procedure: The synthesis occurs in two steps.
    1. Mevalonate pathway: Active isoprene is formed from Acetyl-CoA.
    2. Cholesterol biosynthesis: The active isoprene is converted into cholesterol.
- Meaning: About one third of the daily cholesterol requirement is obtained by the organism from food, while the remaining two thirds are synthesized by itself.
- Location: Essentially, all cells are capable of cholesterol biosynthesis; however, it primarily occurs in the liver, brain, and intestine.

## Regulation of Cholesterol Biosynthesis

The cholesterol biosynthesis occurs as needed and is dependent on the supply from food. Regulation takes place through the transcription of involved enzymes and through the allosteric activation of the key enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.

- Regulation of transcription factors
    - Basics
        - All genes for the enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis contain an enhancer, a so-called "sterol regulatory element" (SRE), in their promoter region.
        - Activation of the genes occurs when the transcription factor called "sterol-regulatory-element-binding-protein" (SREBP) binds to the SRE.
        - Process
            - SREBP-2 is a protein that consists of three domains.
                - It is anchored in the membrane of the smooth ER with the luminal domain.
                - The C- and N-terminal domains extend into the cytosol.
            - SREBP-2 is bound to a protein called SCAP.
            - In case of excess cholesterol
                - SCAP binds cholesterol
                - Consequently, the SCAP-SREBP-2 complex binds another protein called "INSIG"
                - INSIG fixes the complex in the membrane → Cholesterol biosynthesis↓
            - In case of cholesterol deficiency
                - SCAP does not bind cholesterol.
                - SCAP-SREBP-2 complex dissociates from INSIG protein and is transported to the Golgi apparatus.
                - The protease S1P cleaves SREBP-2 in the luminal domain.
                - The protease S2P cleaves off the N-terminal domain
                - The N-terminal domain now migrates into the cell nucleus and acts there as a transcriptional activator through binding to SRE → Cholesterol biosynthesis↑
- Allosteric regulation of HMG-CoA reductase
    - HMG-CoA reductase (Syn. cholesterol synthesis enzyme, CSE): Key enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis
        - Sits in the membrane of the smooth ER
        - Transmembrane domains have – similar to SCAP – binding sites for cholesterol
        - In case of excess cholesterol and energy deficiency, the enzyme is allosterically inhibited.
            - In case of excess cholesterol
                - Transmembrane domains of HMG-CoA reductase bind cholesterol
                - Binding triggers an increased breakdown of the enzyme.
            - In case of energy deficiency
                - Inactivation by phosphorylation of the enzyme by AMP-activated protein kinase

> [!NOTE]
> If the cholesterol content in the membrane of the ER decreases, the transcription of the genes for the LDL receptor and for proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis is upregulated!

> [!NOTE] HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
> The increase in blood cholesterol can have serious health consequences. Cholesterol also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Follow-up diseases can include, for example, coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, or stroke. Therapeutically, one targets (in addition to lifestyle and dietary changes) the HMG-CoA reductase. This is competitively inhibited by the so-called statins, which have a high structural similarity to mevalonate.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Cholesterol
### Digestion, Absorption, Transport, and Excretion

How is cholesterol transported in the blood?
- The transport of cholesterol in the blood occurs via lipoproteins. From the intestine to the liver, cholesterol is transported together with TAGs in the form of chylomicrons or chylomicron remnants, from the liver to the tissues the transport takes place via VLDL and LDL. The so-called reverse cholesterol transport from the tissues to the liver is carried out by HDL and IDL.
How are chylomicrons converted into chylomicron remnants?
- Chylomicrons are lipoproteins synthesized in the mucosal cells of the intestine. Their main task is the transport of triacylglycerols (TAGs) from the intestine to peripheral cells. After delivering a large part of their TAGs to the tissues they are referred to as chylomicron remnants and subsequently transport mainly cholesterol and the remaining TAGs to the liver.
### Cholesterol Biosynthesis

What is the significance of the so-called mevalonate pathway? What are its starting and end products?
- The mevalonate pathway refers to the initial steps of cholesterol biosynthesis. The starting material Acetyl-CoA is converted into "active isoprene," an equilibrium mixture of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The active isoprene then forms the basic building block of cholesterol.
Which step of the mevalonate pathway is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase? What is the significance of this step for cholesterol biosynthesis?
- HMG-CoA reductase reduces HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This is the rate-limiting reaction (the so-called pace-setting reaction) of cholesterol biosynthesis.
Which vitamin can be formed from cholesterol and in which organ does the synthesis take place?
- Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) can be formed from cholesterol in the liver. It is thus the only vitamin that can be produced entirely by the body alone.
Which intermediate of cholesterol biosynthesis is produced by the coupling of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)?
- In the third step of cholesterol biosynthesis, squalene is formed with the help of squalene synthase from two FPP molecules.
### Regulation of Cholesterol Biosynthesis

What are the two mechanisms through which regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis occurs?
- Cholesterol biosynthesis takes place according to demand and depending on the cholesterol supply from the diet. Regulation occurs both via the key enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is inhibited by cholesterol itself (negative feedback), and through the activation or repression of the transcription of involved enzymes.
What are "sterol-regulatory-element-binding proteins" (SREBP) and what role do they play in the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis?
- Sterol-regulatory-element-binding proteins (SREBP) are transcription factors that can bind to intracellular cholesterol via the protein SCAP. When there is a cholesterol deficiency, no binding occurs, SREBP migrates into the nucleus and binds there to the "sterol-regulatory element" (SRE) of the genes for the LDL receptor and enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis. These are thereby more strongly transcribed, resulting in both increased uptake and synthesis of cholesterol. When there is an excess of cholesterol, the SCAP-SREBP complex binds to cholesterol and no transport into the nucleus occurs.
