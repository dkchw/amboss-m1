# Pancreas
## Summary

The pancreas, also known as the pancreas (from Greek pan = "all," kreas = "flesh"), is an elongated organ located transversely in the upper abdomen. On one hand, it produces digestive enzymes that are released into the duodenum to break down the food components in the intestine. On the other hand, it produces hormones that enter the bloodstream directly to primarily regulate blood sugar levels (see: pancreatic hormones).
An inflammation of the pancreatic cells, for example due to excessive alcohol consumption, can release digestive enzymes and lead to a partial autodigestion of the organ. With reduced production of digestive enzymes (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, for example due to inflammation of the pancreas), the nutritional building blocks can no longer be sufficiently broken down into their absorbable form. When the body's own hormone-producing cells are destroyed, it is referred to as Type 1 diabetes mellitus (a subtype of diabetes). By the way, you can also find a histo trainer episode on the pancreas in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the pancreas.

## Microscopic Anatomy

The pancreas mainly consists of exocrine glandular tissue for the production of digestive juices. Only about two percent of the organ mass is endocrine glandular tissue, which is responsible for the production of hormones.

### Exocrine Pancreas

#### Histological Structure

The exocrine part of the pancreas is a purely serous gland and is divided into lobes (lobi), which are further subdivided into lobules (lobuli). The smallest unit is the acini. The organ is traversed by connective tissue septa, which contain larger ducts, blood and lymph vessels, as well as autonomic nerves.

- Structure of a lobule (Lobulus): Acini with associated duct pieces
    - Acinus (also: acinar glandular end piece): Circular arrangement of several gland cells (acinus cells) around a narrow lumen
    - Ducts: Effector ducts of the acini; their ductal epithelial cells partially extend into the acinus (so-called centroacinar cells)
- Secretion: The precursors of the digestive enzymes are produced in the acinar cells and exocytotically released into the duct lumen.
- Drainage pathway of digestive secretions: On its way from the glandular cell to the duodenum, the digestive secretion passes through a series of duct structures with increasing diameter.
    - Acinar end piece → Conduction piece → Intralobular duct → Interlobular duct → Pancreatic duct

> [!NOTE]
> There is no (!) striated duct between the intercalated duct and the interlobular excretory duct, as found in salivary glands!

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to most other glands, the pancreas lacks myoepithelial cells!

> [!NOTE] Pancreatic carcinoma
> The malignant pancreatic cancer most often originates from the ductal epithelium. The most common location is the head of the pancreas. It is a very aggressive tumor: It is usually only discovered once it has already metastasized, as it presents with nonspecific symptoms that do not directly indicate the tumor (e.g., upper abdominal pain, weight loss). Therefore, the chances of recovery are generally very low.

### Endocrine Pancreas (Islet Organ, Langerhans Islet Cells)

As the name island organ suggests, the endocrine cells of the pancreas are distributed in the form of island-like clusters between the exocrine cells. Their density is highest in the area of the pancreatic tail. Each island consists of different cell types that produce various pancreatic hormones. Since these are released directly into the blood, the pancreatic islets are particularly well vascularized.

- Function: Hormone secretion through exocytosis into the interstitium
- Construction
    - Several thousand cells per island
    - Cell types: A, B, D, and PP cells
    - Capillaries with fenestrated endothelium

## Function

The pancreas plays a significant role in digestion and the regulation of blood sugar levels. The secretions of the exocrine portion contain many enzymes that break down the food components into their basic building blocks so that they can then be absorbed by the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa and taken up into the blood. The endocrine portion produces the hormones insulin and glucagon, which together are responsible for regulating blood sugar levels.

### Exocrine Secretion

#### Enzyme Secretion

The proteolytic enzymes as well as phospholipase A are secreted as zymogens (proenzymes, inactive precursors) because the active enzymes are so aggressive that they would digest the pancreatic tissue. In the duodenum, trypsinogen is activated to trypsin by enteropeptidase, which in turn activates the still inactive enzyme precursors (e.g., chymotrypsinogen). The trypsin inhibitor present in pancreatic secretions also protects the pancreas from autodigestion by preventing the activation of the proenzymes by trypsin that is prematurely activated in the pancreatic duct system.

- Stimulating hormone: Cholecystokinin (CCK) from the enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine.

|- Ribonuclease<br>- Deoxyribonuclease|- –<br>- –|RNA/DNA|

#### Secretion of Water and Electrolytes

The acini secrete a plasma-isotonic primary secretion that is rich in Cl− and contains digestive enzymes. The chloride ions enter the lumen through apical channels of the acinar cells, and Na+ follows paracellularly. During the digestive phase, the subsequent duct epithelium secretes a strongly HCO3− (bicarbonate) rich secretion, which raises the pH of the mixture (secondary secretion) to up to 8.2, allowing the acidic gastric juice to be neutralized.

- Stimulating Hormone: Secretin from the enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine
    - Distribution at pH value <4
- Electrolytes
    - Main cations: Na+ and K+
        - Concentrations constant
    - Major anions: Cl− and HCO3−
        - If secretion rate↑ → [Cl−]↓ and [HCO3−]↑
        - Primary secretion: [Cl−]↑ and [HCO3−]↓
        - Secondary secret
            - [Cl−]↓ and [HCO3−]↑
            - Stimulation by secretin in the digestive phase leads to the reversal of the ratio between Cl− and HCO3−.
            - The sum of both anions and thus osmolality remains constant

> [!NOTE]
> Water follows the actively secreted salts secondarily!

> [!NOTE] Pancreatitis
> As pancreatitis is called an inflammation of the pancreas. An acute pancreatitis is distinguished from a chronic pancreatitis. In acute pancreatitis, enzymes are activated before they have left the pancreas, resulting in self-digestion (autodigestion). Strong abdominal pain with belt-like radiation to the back, as well as a tense-elastic abdomen (rubber belly), are typical. The two most common causes for this condition are alcohol consumption and gallstones, which obstruct the ducts of the gallbladder and pancreas, causing a backlog of secretions. Chronic pancreatitis can have different courses, as various pathological tissue changes are possible, which determine the clinical presentation. Its most common cause is alcohol abuse. In the diagnostics of pancreatitis, the two digestive enzymes amylase and lipase play an important role.

> [!NOTE] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
> Loss or damage of pancreatic tissue, for example, in the context of pancreatitis, pancreatic carcinoma, or pancreatic resection, can be associated with a reduced secretion of pancreatic digestive enzymes. This so-called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leads to impaired digestion of food (maldigestion), particularly of fats due to a lack of lipase. This results in fatty stools (steatorrhea) and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (E, D, K, A). Diagnostically, a decreased elastase concentration in the stool is noted.

> [!NOTE] Cystic fibrosis
> In the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis (CF), literally translated as "disease of thick mucus," the chloride ion channel CFTR is defective, leading to impaired water and electrolyte transport: In the exocrine glands of the body, which include the exocrine part of the pancreas, thick mucus is produced instead of a thin secretion. In the case of the pancreas, the secretion of digestive juices is impaired, resulting in disturbed digestion (malabsorption), causing those affected to struggle with chronic diarrhea and growth disorders. The life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis is now over 40 years.

### Endocrine Secretion

#### Overview

The cell types that make up the Langerhans islets of the pancreas are important for regulating carbohydrate metabolism. They produce various pancreatic hormones, including insulin, which is essential for the uptake of sugar molecules into the cells. Four hormone-producing cell types can be distinguished. All of them belong to the gastroenteropancreatic system (GEP system) – the largest endocrine system in the body.

| Cell Types of the Pancreatic Islets |            |                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Cell Type                           | Proportion | Hormone                |
| A-Zelle  <br>(Alphazelle)           | 20%        | Glucagon               |
| B-cell  <br>(Beta cell)             | 70−80%     | Insulin                |
| D-Zelle  <br>(Delta cell)           | 5%         | Somatostatin           |
| PP-Cell                             | 1-2%       | Pancreatic Polypeptide |

"G-A-B-I on the island": island cells of the pancreas: glucagon - A cells, B cells - insulin.

- Sporadically, EC cells (enterochromaffin cells) occur in the pancreatic islands.
    - The majority of these cells are found in the stomach and intestines.
    - They are responsible, among other things, for the production of serotonin.

## Development

The pancreas develops as part of the gastrointestinal tract from two endodermal, originally separate primordia – a ventral and a dorsal pancreatic bud. It is only through the rotation of the stomach that both pancreatic primordia move to the same side, fuse together, and are subsequently displaced retroperitoneally.

- Time: Organ formation in the 5th to 8th week of development followed by differentiation.
- Development
    - Formation of two pancreatic buds as part of the hepatopancreatic ring
        - Anterior bud in the ventral mesogastrium
        - Posterior bud in the dorsal mesogastrium
    - Rotation and Merger
        - The anterior bud moves to the left side of the duodenum below the posterior bud during gastric rotation → The anterior and posterior pancreatic buds merge.
            - The anterior bud becomes the lower part of the head of the pancreas.
            - The rear bud becomes the upper part of the head, the body, and the tail.
    - Formation of gangs
        - In both shares, an individual execution path is originally established for each.
            - The gang of the front bud remains intact.
                - Pancreatic duct (main duct) in the head region
                - Opens into the major duodenal papilla (Papilla Vateri) into the duodenum
            - The group of the rear bud remains partially intact.
                - It forms the passage in the body and tail.
                - Sometimes remains as a separate duct (accessory pancreatic duct)
                    - Then it empties into the minor duodenal papilla into the duodenum (see below: pancreas divisum)
    - Formation of the Langerhans Islands
        - Cells of the gland epithelium begin to develop into hormone-producing cells from the 3rd month of development.
        - Inselform clustering between the exocrine cells
        - Hormone production from the 5th month of development


> [!NOTE] Anomalies of the pancreas
> Pancreas annulare: In some cases, the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse incompletely or not at all, encircling the duodenum (malformation). This constriction can lead to feeding passage disorders with vomiting in newborns and cause inflammatory changes in the intestinal mucosa in the stenosed area.
> 
> Pancreas divisum: When the rotation of the two pancreatic systems functions, but the fusion fails (malfusion), the duct systems remain separate: The minor pancreatic duct (accessory) now forms the main drainage duct, which drains into the minor duodenal papilla. This can lead to the pancreatic secretions not draining well. As a result, some patients suffer from recurrent pancreatitis.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Pancreas
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Describe the course of the pancreatic duct until its opening!
- The ductus pancreaticus (Wirsung duct) runs longitudinally through the entire pancreas. It joins with the ductus choledochus and opens together with it on the major duodenal papilla into the descending part of the duodenum.

What is the so-called hepatopancreatic ampulla?
- The ampulla hepatopancreatica is a ductal dilation formed by the union of the ductus choledochus and the ductus pancreaticus.

Describe typical variants of the pancreatic duct!
- The ductus pancreaticus can also open separately from the ductus choledochus into the duodenum. Additionally, an accessory pancreatic duct (ductus pancreaticus accessorius (Santorini duct)) may be present, which typically opens on the minor duodenal papilla into the descending part of the duodenum.

How is the pancreas supplied with arteries, and how does the venous drainage occur?
- The head of the pancreas is supplied by the superior posterior and anterior pancreaticoduodenal arteries from the gastroduodenal artery and by the pancreaticoduodenal artery from the superior mesenteric artery. The body and tail are supplied by the inferior pancreatic artery, the dorsal pancreatic artery, the artery of the pancreatic tail, and the great pancreatic artery, all originating from the splenic artery. Venous drainage of all three parts occurs through the pancreatic veins, which drain into the splenic vein.

How does the vegetative innervation of the pancreas occur?
- The sympathetic innervation of the pancreas occurs via the pancreatic plexus from the celiac plexus. The parasympathetic innervation also occurs via a pancreatic plexus from the vagus nerve.

### Microscopic Anatomy

Describe the basic histological structure of the exocrine pancreas!
- The exocrine pancreas is a purely serous gland. It is divided into lobes (lobes), which are further subdivided into lobules. The smallest units are the acini. The organ is traversed by connective tissue septa that carry larger ducts, blood and lymph vessels, as well as autonomic nerves.

What special characteristics do the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas exhibit, and what is their function?
- The acinar cells of the terminal portions of the exocrine pancreas synthesize and secrete digestive enzymes (or their precursors, so-called zymogens). Due to their high synthetic activity, they have a large active nucleus, a large Golgi apparatus, and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, eosinophilic zymogen granules are found, in which the zymogens are stored.

Describe the structure and function of the epithelium of the pancreatic ductules!
- The epithelial cells of the intercalated ducts of the pancreas are flat to cuboidal and have a light cytoplasm. Their function is the secretion of bicarbonate (HCO3-) and water (H2O).

### Function

Which digestive enzymes are produced in the pancreas and which hormone stimulates their secretion?
- The exocrine pancreas produces enzymes for the digestion of carbohydrates (α-amylase), fats (lipase, phospholipase A, cholesterol esterase), proteins (carboxypeptidase, trypsin, chymotrypsin), and nucleic acids (ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease). Their secretion is stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK) from the enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine.

How does the pancreas protect itself from autodigestion by digestive enzymes?
- The proteolytic enzymes as well as phospholipase A are secreted as zymogens because the active enzymes are so aggressive that they would digest the pancreatic tissue. Only in the duodenum is trypsinogen activated to trypsin by enteropeptidase, which in turn activates the other inactive enzyme precursors. Additionally, pancreatic secretion contains the so-called trypsin inhibitor, which prevents the activation of proenzymes by prematurely activated trypsin within the pancreatic duct system.

Which electrolytes are contained in pancreatic secretions? How does the primary secretion differ from the secondary secretion?
- Pancreatic secretion contains sodium and potassium at constant concentrations and bicarbonate and chloride at variable concentrations. The primary secretion contains more chloride than bicarbonate. In the digestive phase, the duct epithelial cells secrete increased bicarbonate via a Cl^--HCO3^- antiporter into the duct lumen. Thus, there is a reversal of the ratio: the secondary secretion now contains much more bicarbonate than chloride.

What is the function of the hormone secretin?
- Secretin is released from the enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine when a pH <4 is present there. Secretin then stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate in the epithelial cells of the pancreatic duct. Consequently, the pH of pancreatic secretion can rise up to 8.2, serving to neutralize the acidic chyme.

Name the cell types of the endocrine pancreas and the hormones produced by each! Which cell type is the most commonly present?
- In the islets of Langerhans of the endocrine pancreas are A cells (produce glucagon), B cells (produce insulin), D cells (produce somatostatin), and PP cells (produce pancreatic polypeptide). The most common cells are B cells (approx. 70–80% of the cells).

### Development

What is meant by a pancreas annulare and how does it manifest?
- A pancreas annulare is a developmental anomaly of the pancreas in which the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds do not fuse but instead wrap in a ring shape around the duodenum. In some cases, narrowing causes an obstruction of food passage, which in the newborn can manifest as vomiting.
