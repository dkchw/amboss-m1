# Stomach
## Summary

The stomach (= Gaster) receives the crushed food from the esophagus, mixes it with the gastric juice produced by the gastric glands into a homogeneous food pulp (= chyme), and stores it until further transport. In the mucous membrane of the stomach, there are gastric glands that produce the acidic gastric juice. Histologically, the stomach is constructed similarly to the other organs of the gastrointestinal tract, with some exceptions. By the way, you can also find a histo trainer episode on the stomach in the section on microscopic anatomy.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function
    - Intake of food from the esophagus
    - Processing of food into chyme
- Location: Intraperitoneal in the upper abdomen (epigastric region)
- Form: Variable (e.g. bullhorn stomach, hook stomach, long stomach)
- Length: 25–30 cm
- Capacity: 1200–1600 mL

### Structure

- Sections of the stomach
    - Cardiac part (Cardia): Entrance of the esophagus into the stomach (= Cardiac orifice)
        - Z-line (gastroesophageal junction): Macroscopically visible transition from the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus to the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach
    - Fundus gastricus (gastric fundus): Dome-shaped bulge as the highest point of the stomach (touches the diaphragm); when standing, air collects there, which is visible in the X-ray as the so-called gastric bubble.
    - Corpus gastricum (stomach body): main section of the stomach
    - Pyloric part (gastric outlet): Divided into three sections
        - Pyloric antrum
        - Pyloric canal
        - Pylorus
- Curvatures
    - Greater curvature (Curvatura gastrica major): Large convex-shaped margin of the corpus
    - Lesser curvature (Curvatura gastrica minor): Small concave-shaped margin of the corpus
        - In the lower third, there is a bend (incisura angularis) that represents the transition from the corpus to the pyloric part.
- Surfaces: Anterior wall (= Paries anterior) and posterior wall (= Paries posterior)
- Form
    - Hook stomach: Most common form ("J"-shaped)
    - Langmagen: Extending far caudally
    - Stierhornmagen: Lying approximately horizontally

### Topography

The stomach connects the esophagus and small intestine and is located intraperitoneally in the upper abdomen (epigastrium), with its largest part situated in the left upper abdomen. The stomach is attached by suspensory ligaments (mesentery/omentum) and is indirectly connected to some of the adjacent organs by the greater omentum (omentum majus) and the lesser omentum (omentum minus). The expansion of the stomach depends on various factors (e.g., filling state, stomach shape); only the stomach entrance and exit represent relatively fixed points.

#### Adjacent Organs

|Direction|Stomach Section|Adjacent Organ|
|---|---|---|
|Cranial|- Fundus|- Diaphragm|
|Ventral|- Front wall<br>- Parts of the fundus<br>- Cardia|- Left lobe of the liver<br>- Left costal arch|
|Links|- Fundus|- Spleen|
|Right|- Corpus<br>- Cardia<br>- Parts of the Fundus|- Left Lobe of the Liver|
|Dorsal|- Body|- Pancreatic tail<br>- Left adrenal gland<br>- Upper pole of the left kidney|
|Kaudal|- Underside of the stomach<br>- Pyloric part<br>- Greater curvature|- Transverse colon|

#### Construction Networks

The omental networks (greater omentum and lesser omentum) are fatty duplications of the abdominal peritoneum. They contain connective tissue bands that connect the stomach to other organs, immune cells, blood and lymph vessels, as well as lymph nodes (e.g., hepatic lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament of the lesser omentum).

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

Arterially, the stomach is supplied by branches of the celiac trunk (from the aorta); the venous drainage occurs through veins running parallel to the arteries. The innervation is provided by the autonomously functioning enteric nervous system as well as the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

## Microscopic Anatomy

The stomach exhibits a typical layering for the digestive tract in the tunica mucosa, tela submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica serosa (see: overview of the digestive system). A special feature of the stomach is that it contains tubular glands in the lamina propria of the tunica mucosa, which produce gastric juice, although there are variations depending on the section of the stomach. Furthermore, the tunica muscularis in the fundus and corpus has not just two, but three muscle layers. Macroscopically, coarse mucosal folds (plicae gastricae) can be observed, which, however, flatten out as the stomach fills.

### Histological Features of the Stomach

- Mucous membrane
    - Single-layer cylindrical surface epithelium, covered by a mucus carpet
        - The slime carpet is formed by the surface epithelium itself and by the goblet cells (see below).
    - 1–5 mm large pavement-like fields (Areae gastricae), which lead into small funnel-shaped depressions (Foveolae gastricae)
    - From the gastric foveolae, gastric glands extend into the lamina propria.
- Muscularis layer
    - Oblique fibers (diagonal muscle fibers): Third (innermost) muscle layer
    - At the pylorus, the ring muscle layer thickens into a sphincter muscle (M. sphincter pyloricus)
- Gastric folds: The mucous membrane and the submucosal layer are raised into macroscopically visible longitudinal folds (gastric folds) that are not constant and diminish with increasing stomach filling.

### Mammary Glands

As a special feature, the stomach contains tubular glands in the lamina propria of the tunica mucosa, which produce gastric juice and exhibit differences depending on the section of the stomach.

> [!NOTE] Vitamin B12 deficiency
> When the parietal cells of the stomach are no longer functional (e.g., due to autoantibodies in so-called Type A gastritis) and they produce little or no intrinsic factor, a vitamin B12 deficiency (cobalamin deficiency) can occur. The reason for this is that vitamin B12 can only be absorbed in the ileum when it has formed a complex with intrinsic factor. As a consequence of this deficiency, anemia can occur, as vitamin B12 (along with folic acid) is essential for cell division. The patients receive parenteral vitamin B12 substitution (administered via an infusion) in addition to treatment of the underlying cause, in order to bypass absorption through the ileum.

## Hydrochloric Acid Secretion

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is produced by the parietal cells and is a component of gastric acid. Its secretion involves several steps:

- At the apical (facing the stomach lumen) membrane of the cell, there are ducts (canaliculi).
- In the execution pathways, there is an H+/K+-ATPase that pumps protons out of the cell in exchange for potassium (antiport).
    - The protons are generated in the cytoplasm with the help of carbonic anhydrase from CO2 and H2O (bicarbonate (HCO3‑) is produced in this reaction).
- Bicarbonate leaves the cell through the basolateral membrane in exchange for Cl--ions (antiport).
- Cl- ions traverse the cell and enter the gastric lumen through apical Cl- channels.
- Additionally, there is a Na+/K+-ATPase at the basolateral membrane of the cell that actively transports 2 K+ ions into the cell in exchange for 3 Na+ ions.
- The K+ gradient is then restored by transporting the K+ ions back into the gastric lumen through an apical K+ channel.

> [!NOTE]
> The secretion of gastric acid is stimulated by acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine!

> [!NOTE]
> At a pH value <4 in the duodenum, neuronal reflex arcs are triggered that inhibit gastric acid production!

## Function

The stomach mixes the already crushed food, breaks it down into even smaller particles, and stores it until further transport. In addition, the stomach produces gastric juice, which converts the swallowed food into chyme. This is then gradually transferred to the duodenum.

### Gastric Juice

The gastric juice is produced by the cells of the gastric glands and released into the stomach lumen. It serves to break down food. Since some components of gastric juice can damage the stomach lining, there are several protective mechanisms to prevent this. Three different secretion phases of gastric juice production are distinguished.

#### Composition of Gastric Juice

- Water
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl) (from the parietal cells)
- Pepsin (from the chief cells)
- Mucin (from the surface epithelial cells and goblet cells)
- Bicarbonate (from the surface epithelial cells)
- Intrinsic factor (from the parietal cells)

> [!NOTE]
> About 2 liters of gastric juice are produced per day!

#### Protective mechanisms of the gastric mucosa

Some components (acid, pepsins) in gastric juice can attack and damage the mucous membrane of the stomach. The following mechanisms exist for protection:

- Continuous cell renewal by stem cells
- Diffusion barrier created by tight junctions between epithelial cells prevents the transport of acid to the unprotected (mucus-free) side of the epithelium.
- Prostaglandin E2: Is produced by the cells of the gastric mucosa.
    - Leads to an increased production of bicarbonate, which neutralizes the acidic gastric juice.
    - Leads to an increased mucus production through stimulation of the goblet cells
    - Directly inhibits gastric acid secretion at the mucosal cells via EP3 receptors.
- Blood flow in the vessels of the lamina propria mucosae

> [!NOTE] Magenulkus
> A gastric ulcer (stomach ulcer) is a tissue defect of the gastric mucosa that extends beyond the lamina muscularis mucosae. Such a defect arises from an imbalance between the aggressive components of gastric juice and the protective mechanisms of the gastric mucosa. Often, an infection of the stomach with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori contributes to such an imbalance. This bacterium can survive in the acidic stomach and triggers inflammatory processes that weaken the protective mechanisms of the stomach and enhance the aggressive factors. For treatment, patients are given a medication that inhibits gastric acid production, along with antibiotics to combat the bacterium.

#### Phases of Gastric Juice Production

### Chyme Formation

For the formation of the food pulp (chyme), gastric motility plays an important role. It mixes food and gastric juice and also leads to the mechanical emulsification of fats, among other things. In this regard, there is a difference between the proximal and distal sections of the stomach: The proximal part primarily stores the food, while the distal part is responsible for mixing food and gastric juice as well as for the transfer to the duodenum.

1. Proximal stomach: Storage of food with constant wall tension
2. Large curvature (especially at the boundary between the fundus and corpus): Pacemaker center
    - The intake of food triggers peristaltic waves.
    - Food and gastric juice are mixed → Chyme is formed
3. M. sphincter pyloricus: When a peristaltic wave reaches the sphincter muscle, it opens a few millimeters.
    - Small amounts of the food puree reach the duodenum
    - Components that are not yet sufficiently crushed are mixed again.
    - Average retention time of solid foods in the stomach: 1–3 hours

> [!NOTE]
> Hyperosmolar chyme leads in the duodenum and proximal jejunum to an increased secretion of water and bicarbonate in the pancreas and duodenal glands (e.g. Brunner's glands) through the release of secretin, among other factors!

> [!NOTE] Vomiting
> Vomiting is a protective reflex that prevents the body from absorbing harmful substances. The control of this reflex occurs through the vomiting center, which is located in the medulla oblongata. There are many triggers for vomiting, such as intoxications (e.g., from alcohol and spoiled food), hormonal changes during pregnancy, or severe pain. Vomiting is usually accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as nausea, pallor (vasoconstriction of the dermal blood vessels), sweating, and tachycardia. The process is partly voluntary and partly involuntary, beginning with a deep inspiration. This is followed by the closure of the oropharynx and glottis, and relaxation of the stomach muscles. Subsequently, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes; the diaphragm and abdominal wall tense up. Through a contraction of the antrum, the stomach contents are now emptied into the esophagus and (after the relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter) into the mouth. In cases of very severe or chronic vomiting, there can be metabolic alkalosis (due to the loss of stomach acid), hypovolemia (due to fluid loss), or hypokalemia (due to potassium loss).

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Stomach

### Macroscopic Anatomy

What is the so-called Z-line?
- The Z-line (ora serrata) refers to the macroscopically visible transition from the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus to the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach.

In which section of the stomach does the so-called gastric bubble appear on the posterior-anterior (p.a.) X-ray?
- In the standing patient, there is an accumulation of air in the most cranially located section of the stomach, the gastric fundus. In the p.a. X-ray image, this air appears under the left diaphragm dome as the so-called gastric bubble.

What is the name of the visible transition from the corpus gastricum to the antrum pyloricum at the lesser curvature?
- The transition from the stomach body (corpus) into the pyloric part (pars pylorica) is visible at the lesser curvature by a notch, the so-called incisura angularis.

Which ligaments form the lesser omentum? Between which organs do they each run?
- The lesser omentum is formed by the hepatoduodenal ligament and the hepatogastric ligament. As their names suggest, they run between the liver and the duodenum or the lesser curvature of the stomach.

Which organs are connected to the stomach by the ligaments of the greater omentum?
- The greater omentum extends from the greater curvature of the stomach like an apron over the intestinal loops. It connects the stomach to the transverse colon, spleen, and diaphragm.

Which vessels run in the lig. gastrosplenicum? From which artery do they originate and which section of the stomach do they supply?
- The short gastric arteries, originating from the splenic artery, run in the gastrosplenic ligament and supply the gastric fundus as well as a small portion of the greater curvature.

Both the small and large curvature have so-called vascular arcades. Which arteries anastomose here respectively?
- At the greater curvature, the right and left gastroomental arteries form a vascular arcade; at the lesser curvature, the left and right gastric arteries anastomose.

The entire stomach is supplied with blood through arteries from the celiac trunk. Name the corresponding vessel branches!
- The celiac trunk initially divides into three branches: left gastric artery, splenic artery, and common hepatic artery. The left gastric artery runs directly to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The splenic artery gives off the short gastric arteries, the posterior gastric artery, and the left gastroomental artery. The right gastric artery usually arises from the proper hepatic artery but can also originate from the common hepatic artery. The gastroduodenal artery, always arising from the common hepatic artery, finally gives off the right gastroomental artery.

Through which three major vessels does the venous drainage from the stomach occur?
- The main portion of venous drainage from the stomach occurs via the splenic vein and the hepatic portal vein. Only the right gastroomental vein drains blood into the superior mesenteric vein, which then joins with the splenic vein to form the portal vein.

### Microscopic Anatomy

What special feature does the tunica muscularis in the gastric fundus and body exhibit?
- Unlike the rest of the gastrointestinal tract, the tunica muscularis in the fundus and corpus of the stomach consists of an additional third layer of obliquely oriented muscle fibers, the fibrae obliquae.

Which enteroendocrine cell type predominates in the pyloric region and which hormone does it produce?
- The most common enteroendocrine cell type in the pyloric region is the gastrin-producing G cell.

In the stomach, depending on the section, different cell types are present in the glands. Which cells can be found in the fundus and corpus?
- In the fundus and corpus lie the so-called chief glands of the stomach (glandulae gastricae propriae), where the actual production of gastric juice by chief, mucous neck, and parietal cells takes place. Additionally, there are stem cells and histamine-producing ECL cells.

What coloring behavior do the parietal cells exhibit? What is contained in their secretion?
- The chief cells are rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum and therefore stain basophilic (dark blue). They produce pepsinogen.

Which glandular cells exhibit a basophilic staining behavior? What do they produce?
- The chief cells are rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum and therefore stain basophilic (dark blue). They produce pepsinogen.

Which cells produce mucins and what is their function?
- Mucins are glycoproteins secreted by the mucous neck cells of the stomach. By binding water, they create a mucus layer that provides a certain protection of the gastric mucosa against the acidic gastric juice.

### Hydrochloric Acid Secretion

Name the three essential stimulators of gastric acid secretion!
- Gastric acid secretion is stimulated by acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine.

Which mechanism is responsible for neutralizing the acidic chyme in the duodenum, and which hormone plays a role in this process?
- When acidic stomach contents (pH <4) enter the duodenum, a neural reflex arc is triggered, at the end of which secretin is released. Secretin stimulates pancreatic cells to produce bicarbonate and water, which neutralizes and dilutes the acidic chyme. Secretin is also released when hyperosmolar chyme is present in the duodenum or jejunum.

How is the transport of H+ ions from the parietal cell into the gastric lumen carried out?
- The transport of H+ ions (protons) into the gastric lumen is carried out by the H+/K+-ATPase, a proton pump located in the canaliculi of the parietal cell membrane facing the gastric lumen. It actively pumps protons out of the cell in exchange for potassium ions, using ATP.

Through which steps do the chloride ions of hydrochloric acid enter the gastric juice?
- In the cytosol of the parietal cells, protons (H+) and bicarbonate (HCO3‑) are produced by carbonic anhydrase. At the basolateral side of the cell, antiporters expel the produced bicarbonate in exchange for chloride ions into the cell. Chloride ions then pass through apical chloride channels into the gastric lumen, where together with protons they form hydrochloric acid (HCl).

What is the function of the Na+/K+-ATPase located in the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell?
- The Na+/K+-ATPase located in the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell transports 2 potassium ions into the cell in exchange for 3 sodium ions out, thereby maintaining ionic homeostasis of the cytosol.

### Function

Prostaglandin E2 acts as a kind of self-protection for the gastric mucosa against the aggressive components of gastric juice. Name three mechanisms of action!
- Prostaglandin E2 is produced by the cells of the gastric mucosa and provides a kind of "gastric protection" through several mechanisms: it increases the production of neutralizing bicarbonate, stimulates mucus production by mucous neck cells, and decreases gastric acid secretion by stimulating EP3 receptors on parietal cells, which additionally secrete bicarbonate and mucus.

How is the basolateral side of the epithelial cells protected?
- Tight junctions lie between the epithelial cells of the stomach, serving as diffusion barriers preventing the transport of acid onto the unprotected (mucus-free) side of the epithelium.
