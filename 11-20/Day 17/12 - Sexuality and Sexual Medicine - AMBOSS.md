# Sexuality and Sexual Medicine
## Summary

Sexual medicine deals with sexual dysfunctions, disorders of sexual preference, and gender incongruences. Sexual dysfunctions can arise both in the context of physical or mental illnesses, as well as from problems such as those in partnerships or professions.

For the understanding of sexual medicine, it is important to engage with the physiological process of sexual arousal. Throughout the course of sexual arousal, different phases are traversed, from initial arousal through the orgasm phase to the resolution and refractory phase. Disturbances can occur in each of these phases.

At an older age, sexuality changes in both men and women: Women lose, among other things, the ability to reproduce due to hormonal changes, and a series of physical and psychological changes occur. In contrast, while a man's reproductive ability is impaired with increasing age, it remains largely intact, so that functional changes are the focus.
## Process of Sexual Arousal

- Arousal phase
    - Following stimulation, sexual pleasure and physiological changes occur.
    - Increase in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and depth of breathing
    - ♂: Erection of the penis (see also: penis, erection, and ejaculation)
    - ♀: Swelling of the clitoris, labia, and nipples
- Plateau phase: Increase in physiological changes with prolonged sexual arousal
    - ♂: Increased blood flow to the prostate and seminal vesicles leads to increased secretion of the bulbourethral glands and urethral glands.
        - "Pre-cum": Watery-mucous secretion at the external urethral orifice
    - ♀: Increased secretion of the Bartholin glands and increased production of vaginal transudate (= lubrication), increased blood flow to the vagina, swelling and widening, especially of the labia minora.
- Orgasm phase
    - Peak of physical arousal
    - Involuntary muscle contractions in the genital and anal area
    - ♂: Ejaculation
- Postpartum phase
    - Regression of physiological changes
- Refractory phase
    - ♂: Time of Non-Excitability
    - ♀: A renewed response to a stimulus is almost immediately possible.

### Differences in the Arousal Process between Men and Women

- The excitement process is more variable in women.
- The individual phases usually last longer in women (exception: refractory phase)
- The man is in the refractory phase for a certain period after ejaculation.
- In women, the individual phases are more prone to disturbances.
## Sexual Medicine

Sexual medicine deals with sexual dysfunctions, disorders of sexual preference, and gender incongruences. Sexual dysfunctions can arise from physical or mental illnesses, as well as from issues such as those in relationships or careers.

### Sexual Dysfunction

The following is a list of possible sexual dysfunctions. They can each be assigned to a phase of the sexual response cycle.

- Disorders of sexual appetite
    - Reduced or absent libido
    - Aversion to sexuality
- Disturbances of the excitation phase
    - ♂: Erectile dysfunction
    - ♀: Disruption of lubrication
- Disturbances of the plateau phase
    - ♂: Erectile dysfunction
        - Psychogenic erectile dysfunction: No somatic cause, triggered by stress factors such as performance anxiety
    - ♀: Vaginismus: Spasm of the vaginal and pelvic muscles during attempted intercourse
    - Dyspareunia: Pain during sexual intercourse
- Disorders of the orgasm phase
    - ♂: Premature ejaculation, Delayed ejaculation, Incomplete ejaculation, Anorgasmia
    - ♀: Anorgasmia

> [!NOTE]
> A psychological cause of sexual dysfunction should be considered, for example, when the dysfunction varies in severity depending on the sexual practice or even does not occur at all!

### Disorders of Sexual Preference

Disorders of sexual preference are characterized by arousal triggered by unusual objects and situations. The following will provide some examples.

- Exhibitionism: Exposing oneself to strangers causes arousal.
- Voyeurism: Observing others during sexual intercourse triggers arousal.
- Pedophilia: Sexual preference for children
- The following diagnoses belong to the ICD-10 catalog but are no longer listed in the ICD-11, as these preferences usually do not lead to distress or dysfunctional behavior.
    - Fetishism: Certain objects (e.g., shoes) elicit arousal.
    - Sadomasochism: Pain and humiliation are stimuli for sexual arousal
        - Sadism: The infliction of pain provokes arousal
        - Masochism: The experience of pain triggers arousal
    - Fetishistic transvestitism: A desire to wear clothes that are socially associated with the opposite gender in order to experience sexual arousal.

### Gender Incongruence

If people are unable to or can only partially identify with their assigned gender at birth, this is referred to as "gender identity disorder" according to the (still) applicable classification of the ICD-10 and is counted among "mental and behavioral disorders." In the revised ICD-11 version, which came into effect in January 2022 but still needs to be fully translated for use in Germany, diagnoses of gender incongruence are no longer assigned to this category, but rather to the chapter "Conditions related to sexual health."

- According to ICD-11
    - Gender incongruence in adolescence and adulthood (according to ICD-10: Transsexualism): A persistent mismatch between an individual's gender identity and the sex assigned at birth based on physical sexual characteristics; there is often a desire to align one's gender through medical treatment.
    - Gender incongruence of childhood (according to ICD-10: disorder of gender identity in childhood): A persistent mismatch for over 2 years between the individual's gender identity and the assigned sex prior to the onset of puberty; there is often a desire to align one's gender.
- According to ICD-10
    - Transvestitism: The desire to temporarily experience belonging to the opposite sex; a surgical gender reassignment is generally not pursued; changing into clothing typical of the opposite sex is not accompanied by sexual arousal.
## Sexuality in Old Age

### Female Sexuality in Old Age

As people age, their sexual functions change. Female reproductive ability ends with the onset of "menopause." The adjustment of hormone levels also affects other metabolic processes.

#### Definitions

- Climacterium: Transition from the reproductive cycle-dependent phase of life to the ovarian resting phase.
- Menopause: The point at which the last menstrual period has occurred and no further periods have followed for at least 1 year.
    - Average age 52 years

#### Hormonal Changes

The decreasing function of the ovaries leads to lower levels of estrogen and progesterone. This, in turn, removes the inhibition (negative feedback) of the gonadotropic hormones FSH and LH, causing their blood levels to rise. Over time, there are more cycles without ovulation until ovarian function eventually ceases completely.

- Hormone levels
    - FSH/LH ↑
    - Estradiol/Progesterone ↓
    - Testosterone and prolactin normal

#### Symptoms of Postmenopause

- Possible side effects of hormonal changes
    - Hot flashes
    - Depression
    - Nervousness
    - Sexual activity ↓
- Consequences of estrogen deficiency
    - Osteoporosis
    - Atrophy of the external and internal genital organs

### Male Sexuality in Old Age

Male reproductive capacity is indeed impaired with advancing age; however, it remains largely intact, so that functional changes are in the foreground.

- Quantity and quality of the seeds ↓
- Sexual activity ↓
- Sexual reaction ↓
## Review Questions on the Chapter Sexuality and Sexual Medicine
### Process of Sexual Arousal

Name the phases of sexual arousal. What differences are there between men and women?
- Sexual arousal usually occurs in successive phases. In the excitement phase, stimulation leads to sexual pleasure and physiological changes. This is followed by the plateau phase, during which the physiological changes and sexual arousal increase until the orgasm phase. This is followed by a phase of regression of physiological changes and, in men, a refractory phase during which further arousal is not possible. In women, the individual phases of sexual arousal last longer and are more variable and prone to disruptions in their course.
### Sexual Medicine

When do we speak of sexual dysfunctions?
- Sexual dysfunctions can affect any phase of the sexual response cycle and prevent satisfactory sexuality. They can, for example, occur in the context of physical or psychological illnesses.
When do we talk about disturbances of sexual preference? Name typical examples!
- A disturbance of sexual preference exists when unusual objects and situations trigger arousal. For example, voyeurism describes the desire to observe other people without their knowledge for one's own sexual arousal during intimate activities (sexual activity, undressing, etc.). Pedophiles have a sexual preference for children, and exhibitionists become sexually aroused by exposing themselves to strangers.
How can a psychogenic erectile dysfunction be distinguished from a physiological one?
- In physiological erectile dysfunction, an erection is generally not possible. If patients report that an erection is possible without problems, for example during masturbation, but not during intercourse, this suggests a psychogenic cause.
What is meant by dyspareunia?
- Dyspareunia is the technical term for pain during intercourse. This sexual dysfunction can have somatic (e.g., infections, scars) or psychological (e.g., conflicts in the relationship) causes.
### Sexuality in Old Age

How do hormone levels in women change with age?
- Progesterone and estradiol levels decrease due to the declining function of the ovaries with age. Consequently, the negative feedback on FSH and LH is missing, so that their plasma levels increase.
How does a man's sexuality change with age?
- In men, with increasing age, there is a decline in the quality and quantity of sperm as well as reduced sexual activity and response.
