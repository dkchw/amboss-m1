# Abdominal cavity
## Summary

The abdomen consists of the abdominal wall, the abdominal cavity, and the contained abdominal organs. The abdominal wall is primarily made up of muscles and, along with the back and hip muscles, provides trunk movement and stabilization. The abdominal cavity is divided based on its lining with the peritoneum into a peritoneal cavity covered by peritoneum and an extraperitoneal space not covered by peritoneum. Depending on the part of the abdominal cavity in which an organ is located, intraperitoneal organs are distinguished from extraperitoneal organs. Due to the complicated embryonic development of the peritoneal relationships, various spaces and recesses arise that structure the abdominal cavity and are clinically relevant (e.g. for surgical access routes).
## Profile

The abdomen consists of the abdominal wall, the abdominal cavity (= Cavitas abdominalis), and the organs of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal cavity is clearly separated from the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm, but it transitions into the pelvic cavity without a clear distinction. The topographical boundary between the abdominal and pelvic cavities is marked only by the so-called upper pelvic inlet plane.

- Limitations
    - Cranial: Diaphragm
    - Ventral/lateral: Anterior and lateral abdominal muscles
    - Dorsal: Posterior abdominal and back muscles, spine
    - Caudal: Upper pelvic inlet level (Terminal line)

## Peritoneum and Mesentery

### The Peritoneum (Abdominal Cavity)

The peritoneum is a serous membrane that lines the abdominal cavity, sealing it airtight and allowing for the movement of organs against one another. Organs that are not located in the abdominal cavity lined by the peritoneum are referred to as extraperitoneal organs.

- Visceral peritoneum: Covers the organs that lie in the peritoneal cavity.
    - Innervation: Vegetative fibers and partially (e.g., liver, gallbladder) branches of the phrenic nerve
- Parietal Peritoneum: Lines the peritoneal cavity.
    - Innervation: Spinal nerves and phrenic nerve

#### Peritoneal Folds

- Umbilical folds: Peritoneal folds on the inside of the abdominal wall
    - Median umbilical fold: Contains the obliterated urachus
    - Medial umbilical fold: Contains the umbilical artery (this artery obliterates after birth)
    - Lateral umbilical fold: Contains the inferior epigastric artery and vein.
- Superior duodenal fold: Contains the inferior mesenteric vein, defines the superior duodenal recess
- Inferior duodenal fold: Limits the inferior duodenal recess
- Gastropancreatic fold: Contains the left gastric artery and forms the boundary between the antrum and the main cavity of the omental bursa.
- Hepatopancreatic fold: Contains the common hepatic artery

### Mesenterium (Meso, Mesentery)

The intraperitoneal organs are attached to the back wall of the abdominal cavity by connective tissue sheets that are covered by a visceral peritoneum. This provides them with support, but also allows for movement against each other. At the radix (= root) of the mesos, the transition from visceral to parietal peritoneum occurs. Moreover, the conduits to the organs enter here. Since the mesos are covered with peritoneum on both sides, they are also referred to as peritoneal duplications.

- Definition: Peritoneal duplications that attach the intraperitoneal organs to the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity.
- Structure: Plates of connective and adipose tissue that are enclosed on both sides by visceral peritoneum.
    - Origin at the root of the mesentery (mesenteric root)
        - Entrance of the conduits from the retroperitoneal space
        - Transition of the visceral peritoneum of the mesentery to the parietal peritoneum of the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity
        - Runs diagonally from the flexure of the duodenojejunal to the ileocecal valve towards the right and caudal.

- Function
    - Restriction of the range of motion of the abdominal organs
    - Guiding structure for vessels, nerves, and lymphatic pathways of the intraperitoneal organs
- Examples: Designation according to the respective organ and the prefix "Mes-" or "Meso-"
    - Mesocolon transversum = Meso of the Transverse Colon
    - Mesogastrium = Meso of the Stomach
    - Ligamentum gastrosplenicum = Mesentery between the stomach and the spleen

## Division of the Abdominal Cavity

### Floors

By a horizontal line through the navel, the abdomen can be divided into an upper abdomen and a lower abdomen. This classification is primarily used in clinical practice.

|Floor|Included Organs|
|---|---|
|Upper Abdomen|- Stomach<br>- Duodenum<br>- Liver<br>- Gallbladder with bile ducts<br>- Spleen<br>- Pancreas|
|Lower abdomen|- Small intestine (excluding the duodenum)<br>- Large intestine (excluding the rectum)|

> [!NOTE]
> Although the transverse colon is located above the navel line, it is functionally considered part of the lower abdomen!

### Spaces and Recesses

In the peritoneal cavity, there are various recesses (= pouches). Recesses on the posterior wall of the peritoneal cavity, which arise due to the transition of a segment of the intestine from retro- to intraperitoneal, are distinguished from recesses that form between the organs and their mesentery. These pouches are also referred to as drainage spaces.

#### Omental bursa

The omental bursa is an auxiliary space of the peritoneal cavity that has developed due to the displacement of originally intraperitoneal abdominal organs to the extraperitoneal space. It is the largest recess of the abdominal cavity and consists of a main space that expands into three recesses. It is bordered by various organs and structures.

- Construction
    - Entrance: Omental foramen (The omental foramen is located between the hepatoduodenal ligament and the superior part of the duodenum.)
    - Ante-room (= Vestibulum bursae omentalis)
    - Main room with three recesses
        - Links: Splenic recess
        - Cranial: Superior recess
        - Caudal: Inferior recess

##### Constraining Structures of the Foyer

- Cranial: Caudate lobe of the liver
- Caudal: Pancreas
- Dorsal: Inferior vena cava
- Ventral: Lesser omentum

> [!NOTE] Ascites and intraperitoneal bleeding
> Ascites refers to an intraperitoneal accumulation of fluid that can have various causes (e.g., liver cirrhosis, inflammation of the peritoneum, malignancy in the abdominal cavity). In lying patients, this fluid typically accumulates predominantly in the hepatorenal recess, as this pouch represents the lowest point of the abdominal cavity when in the supine position. In clinical practice, the recess is also referred to as the "Morison pouch." Additionally, in the case of intraperitoneal bleeding, fluid also accumulates here, which can be detected early via ultrasound.

## Embryonic Development and Overview of Peritoneal Duplications

During embryonic development, the formation of mesenteries, ligaments, and membranes occurs, which subdivide the abdominal cavity and lead to the establishment of adult peritoneal relationships.

### Development of Mesos

1. The endodermal tube (= the primitive gut canal) is located in the center of the body cavity.
2. Mesoderm plates connect the endoderm tube with the coelomic cavity.
    1. In the upper part, both the ventral and dorsal mesodermal plate
    2. In the lower portion, however, only the dorsal mesoderm plate.
3. The mesoderm plates develop into the mesentery for the organs of the peritoneal cavity.
    1. Ventral = Primitive ventral mesentery
    2. Dorsal = Dorsal primitive mesentery
4. Through the various growth and displacement processes of the abdominal organs, the mesenteries move from the sagittal plane to the frontal plane.

### Overview of the Peritoneal Duplications of the Digestive System

|Embryonic Basis|   |Adult Meso|   |Content|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|- Ventral mesogastrium|- Ventral mesohepatic|- Falciform ligament of the liver (from the ventral mesohepatic)|   |- Obliterated umbilical vein<br>- Round ligament of the liver|
|- Lesser omentum (from the dorsal mesohepaticum)|- Hepatogastric ligament|- Right and left gastric arteries|
|- Dorsal mesohepatic|- Hepatoduodenal ligament|- Common bile duct<br>- Proper hepatic artery<br>- Hepatic portal vein|
|- Dorsal mesogastrium|   |- Splenorenal ligament|   |- Splenic artery<br>- Splenic vein|
|- Greater omentum|- Gastrophrenic ligament|- No included structures|
|- Gastrosplenic ligament |- Short gastric arteries |
|- Gastrocolic ligament |- Right and left gastroepiploic arteries |
|- Mesojejunum and Mesoileum|   |- Mesentery|   |- A. mesenterica superior and its branches|
|- Mesocolon|   |- Mesosigmoid|   |- Sigmoid arteries|
|- Transverse mesocolon|   |- Middle colic artery|
|- Mesoappendix (= Mesenteriolum)|   |- A. appendicularis|

### Development of the omental bursa

1. Columns are formed in the dorsal mesogastrium, which merge into a cavity.
2. The dorsal mesogastrium elongates and is shifted to the left side of the body during the rotation of the stomach.
3. As a result of the stomach torsion, the mesoes of the stomach assume a frontal position.
4. A cavity forms in the dorsal part of the ventral mesogastrium and the stomach: the omental bursa.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Abdominal Cavity
### Peritoneum and Mesentery

Through which structures are the following peritoneal folds raised: median, medial, and lateral umbilical folds, gastropancreatic fold, superior duodenal fold?
- The plicae umbilicales are peritoneal folds on the inner side of the abdominal wall, raised by various structures: the median umbilical fold contains the obliterated urachus; in the medial umbilical fold runs the postnatally obliterated umbilical artery in the fetus; and the lateral umbilical fold carries the inferior epigastric artery and vein. The gastropancreatic fold contains the left gastric artery as well as the common hepatic artery, and the superior duodenal fold of the superior duodenal recess is raised by the inferior mesenteric vein.

Which sections of the intestine are intraperitoneal?
- The sections of the small and large intestine have different relationships to the peritoneal cavity. Intraperitoneal are: the superior part of the duodenum with the ampulla of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, vermiform appendix, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon.

### Division of the Abdominal Cavity

What is the omental bursa?
- The omental bursa is an auxiliary space of the peritoneal cavity that arose from the displacement of originally intraperitoneal abdominal organs to extraperitoneal positions. It consists of an anterior and a main chamber.

How is the vestibule of the omental bursa bounded?
- The vestibule of the omental bursa is bounded cranially by the caudate lobe of the liver, caudally by the pancreas, dorsally by the inferior vena cava, and ventrally by the lesser omentum.

How is the main chamber of the bursa omentalis bounded dorsally and ventrally?
- The main chamber of the omental bursa is bounded ventrally by the stomach, lesser omentum, and gastrocolic ligament. The dorsal boundary is formed by the pancreas, left kidney and adrenal gland, lumbar part of the diaphragm, as well as the abdominal aorta and celiac trunk.

Where is the so-called omental tuber located and which organ forms it?
- The omental tuber is a bulge of the dorsal wall of the omental bursa and is formed by the underlying body of the pancreas.

Which structure must be transected caudally to obtain a surgical access route to the bursa omentalis?
- The inferior recess of the omental bursa is bounded caudally by the transverse colon; accordingly, it can be surgically opened after transection of the transverse mesocolon (the attachment of the transverse colon to the abdominal wall).

### Embryonic Development and Overview of Peritoneal Duplications

From which embryonic structure do the ligaments hepatogastricum and hepatoduodenale develop?
- The hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments are collectively also known as the lesser omentum. They develop from the dorsal mesohepatic, which together with the ventral mesohepatic forms the ventral mesogastrium.
