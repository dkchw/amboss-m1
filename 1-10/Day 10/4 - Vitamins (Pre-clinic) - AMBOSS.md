# Vitamins (Pre-clinic)
## Summary

Under the term "vitamins," a number of very different organic compounds are grouped together, which are needed in small amounts for metabolism. What the vitamins have in common is that they are not broken down for energy production but fulfill very specific functions: Most vitamins serve as cofactors for various reactions (e.g., biotin in carboxylations and pyridoxal phosphate in transaminations); others act as antioxidants, thereby protecting cells and their membranes from free radicals (e.g., ascorbic acid and tocopherol).

Vitamins are essential nutrients and must be obtained through food. An exception is vitamin D, which can also be synthesized by the organism itself. With a "normal" mixed diet, the need for individual vitamins is covered quite reliably; thus, deficiencies occur mainly due to malnutrition, specific dietary forms (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency in vegan diets), or due to absorption disorders. Vitamins are divided into fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body, while water-soluble ones cannot (exception: vitamin B12).
## Basics

Vitamins (from Latin vita = "life" and the chemical substance group "amines") are substances that primarily perform catalytic and regulatory functions in metabolism and are essential for the maintenance of many bodily processes. They must be supplied from external sources in small amounts. Vitamins are indeed essential nutrients that (with one exception) cannot be produced in relevant amounts by the human organism itself. Not every vitamin consists of just one compound; often, multiple compounds (vitamers) are present that are grouped together into a vitamin class.

- Classification: According to their solubility
    - Fat-soluble vitamins: Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K
    - Water-soluble vitamins: Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B7, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C
- Sources
    - Food
    - Endogenous production: Vitamin D (cholecalciferol) can be synthesized by the body in significant amounts as the only vitamin.
    - Gut flora: Some vitamins can be synthesized in small amounts by the gut flora.
        - Vitamin K
        - Vitamin B9 (Folic acid)
        - Vitamin B7 (Biotin)
        - Vitamin B12
- Vitamin requirements: Highly individual; subject to various influencing factors as well as individual fluctuations
    - Increased vitamin requirements exist, for example, in the following cases:
        - High physical strain
        - Growth phase
        - Pregnancy and breastfeeding
- Functions: Act, among other things, as
    - Cofactors (e.g. B vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin K)
    - Hormone (e.g. Vitamin D)
    - Antioxidants (e.g. Vitamin C)
    - Signal transduction (e.g. Vitamin A)
    - Influence on gene expression (e.g. Vitamin A, Vitamin E)

Hypo-/Avitaminosis

- Definition
    - Hypovitaminosis: Under-supply of the organism (vitamin deficiency)
    - Avitaminosis: Complete absence of a vitamin in the organism
- Possible causes
    - Malnutrition
    - Inadequate vitamin intake (e.g. due to special diets)
    - Absorption disorder in the intestine
    - Genetic defects
- Pathogenesis: Depletion of vitamin stores → Disturbed intermediary metabolism → Clinical symptoms → Organ changes
- Symptoms: Mostly nonspecific, such as fatigue or concentration difficulties.
- Therapy: Vitamin substitution

Hypervitaminosis

- Definition: Over-supply of the organism (vitamin surplus)
- Causes: Affects almost only fat-soluble vitamins, as they are stored in the body → impaired elimination
- Symptoms: Dependent on the overdosed vitamin

## Fat-Soluble Vitamins

Fat-soluble vitamins are non-polar molecules that are absorbed from food along with lipids. They can be stored in various places in the body and released when needed.

- The fat-soluble vitamins include
    - Vitamin A (Retinoid)
    - Vitamin D (Calciferol)
    - Vitamin E (Tocopherol)
    - Vitamin K (Phylloquinone)
- Resorption and Transport: Together with the dietary lipids
    1. Bile acids enclose fat-soluble vitamins in an aqueous environment and form so-called micelles.
    2. Absorption in the intestine (especially in the duodenum) and packaging into chylomicrons
    3. Release into the lymph and transport via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream
    4. Transport to the liver
    5. Transport from the liver to the target cell using specialized transport proteins

> [!NOTE]
> Fat-soluble vitamins: EDeKA

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body!

## Vitamin A (Retinoid)

The main substance of vitamin A is retinol; however, substances with the same biological effect, such as retinal and retinoate, are also counted as vitamin A. These compounds are grouped under the term "retinoids."

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Retinoids
- Chemical lead structure: Isoprene
- Inactive precursors (provitamins): Carotenoids such as beta-carotene (= a tetraterpene)
- Active Forms
    - Retinal (Aldehyde)
    - Retinoate (carboxylic acid anion)
    - Retinol (Alcohol)

### Physiology

- Natural sources
    - Plant sources: As an inactive precursor (especially beta-carotene) in yellow and green vegetables (e.g., carrots, spinach, fennel, kale)
    - Animal sources: As storage forms (retinyl esters) e.g. in liver, fish, eggs
- Activation: Beta-carotene is converted through oxidative cleavage into two molecules of retinal; retinal can be reversibly reduced to retinol and irreversibly oxidized to retinoate.
- Transport: In addition to the usual mechanism for fat-soluble vitamins (see above) as retinol via transport proteins.
    - Retinol-binding protein (RBP): In the blood to the target cells
    - CRAB proteins: Bind selectively only retinoate
- Storage: In the Ito cells of the liver
    - Storage form: Retinyl ester (e.g., Retinyl palmitate)
        - Reduction of retinal to retinol → esterification to retinyl ester (e.g. with palmitate to retinyl palmitate)
        - Release of retinol by esterase if necessary
- Excretion: Through bile and urine

### Function

- Visual process: Component of rhodopsin as 11-cis-retinal
- Gene regulation: Regulation of various genes for cell growth and differentiation, reproduction, and embryogenesis
    - Mechanism of action: Retinoic acid acts as a ligand for intracellular nuclear receptors (ligand-activated transcription factors), including the enhancement of gene expression of:
        - Keratin
        - Laminin
- Development and maintenance of various tissue structures, e.g.
    - Skin and mucous membrane
    - Mucus-forming cells
    - Bones and connective tissue

> [!NOTE]
> While retinal is primarily important for the visual process, retinoate and retinol play more of a role in gene regulation as well as the maintenance of tissues!



> [!NOTE] Retinoids for skin disorders
> Retinoids regulate the normal development of skin cells and thus contribute to healthy skin. For this reason, they are also used as therapeutics in skin diseases such as, for example, acne vulgaris or rosacea (copper rash).



> [!NOTE] Teratogenic Potential
> Vitamin A derivatives are teratogenic and lead to malformations of the skeleton, ears, and central nervous system. Therefore, corresponding substances are absolutely contraindicated in the case of a desire to conceive and during pregnancy.

Vitamin A deficiency

- Causes: Malnutrition or the body's inability to split the provitamin beta-carotene
- Symptoms
    - Leading symptom: Night blindness
    - In cases of pronounced, chronic deficiency, the protective effect of vitamin A on the tissue is lacking.
        - Dry eyes and mucous membranes
        - Growth disorder (in adolescents)

## Vitamin D (Calciferol)

Besides vitamin D3, which the body can produce itself as well as obtain from animal products, there is vitamin D2, which predominantly occurs in plants and some vitamin supplements. Vitamin D can be produced by the body itself, as well as derived from food. In both cases, however, activation is necessary, as only the activated form can perform the natural functions.

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Steroids
- Chemical lead structures
    - Ergocalciferol (Vitamin D2)
    - Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3)
- Inactive precursors (provitamins)
    - Ergosterol (Provitamin D2)
    - 7-Dehydrocholesterol (Provitamin D3)
- Active Forms
    - 1,25-Dihydroxyergocalciferol (activated Vitamin D2)
    - 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (Calcitriol, activated Vitamin D3)

### Physiology

Vitamin D3 can be synthesized independently by the human organism or, primarily, absorbed through food as cholecalciferol. During the body's own synthesis, cholecalciferol must first be formed in several steps in the skin and liver. The synthesized or food-derived cholecalciferol is then activated to functional calcitriol through several steps involving the liver and kidneys.

- Natural sources: As an inactive precursor, e.g. in fatty fish, eggs, plants
- Synthesis and Activation of Vitamin D
    1. Liver: Cholesterol → 7-Dehydrocholesterol (Provitamin D3)
    2. Skin
        - Storage of 7-Dehydrocholesterol
        - Splitting of 7-dehydrocholesterol by UV rays (between carbon atoms 9 and 10) → Cholecalciferol
    3. Liver: Hydroxylation of Cholecalciferol to 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol (=Calcidiol)
    4. Kidneys: Hydroxylation of position 1 by the 1α-hydroxylase in the cells of the proximal tubule: 25-hydroxycholecalciferol → 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (= calcitriol)
        - The 1α-hydroxylase is activated by parathyroid hormone and inhibited by FGF-23 (=Fibroblast Growth Factor 23), calcium, and phosphate.
- Transport protein to the target cells: Vitamin D binding protein (DBP)
- Storage: Mainly in adipose tissue as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol
- Excretion: Via bile

> [!NOTE]
> Vitamin D is the only vitamin that the body can produce completely on its own!

> [!NOTE] Vitamin D Substitution
> In the growth phase, there is an increased need for vitamin D. Especially during the dark season, it may occur that the vitamin D precursors are not sufficiently converted from sunlight to cholecalciferol. The increased need may not always be met through a balanced diet in this case. Therefore, it is recommended for infants and toddlers to supplement vitamin D in the first two years of life – at least in winter.

### Function

- Influence on calcium and phosphate metabolism
    - Promotes calcium and phosphate resorption in the intestine and in the kidney: Calcium and phosphate levels↑
        - Intestine: Promotion of calcium resorption through increased formation of the calcium transport protein Calbindin
    - In hypocalcemia: Mobilization of calcium and phosphate from the bones
- Promotion of mineralization as well as bone formation and remodeling
    - V.a. indirectly: By maintaining the calcium and phosphate levels
    - Direct: By stimulating osteoblasts and promoting osteoclast differentiation
- Influence of gene expression: The differentiation of hematopoietic cells is modulated by a ligand-dependent transcription factor.
- Modulation of the Immune System

Vitamin D deficiency

- Causes: Since several steps must be taken from vitamin intake or synthesis to activation, a vitamin D deficiency can have very diverse reasons.
    - Low UV radiation in winter
    - Malnutrition
    - Absorption disorders (e.g. in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases)
    - Hydroxylation disorders due to liver or kidney insufficiency
- Symptoms
    - In children: Rickets (due to insufficient bone mineralization, it mainly leads to growth disturbances and skeletal deformities)
    - In adults: Osteomalacia (painful bone softening, possibly with deformities and pathological fractures)

## Vitamin E (Tocopherol)

The main substances of vitamin E are tocopherols, with α-tocopherol dominating in humans due to selection in the liver.

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Tocopherols
- Chemical backbone structure: Chroman ring with isoprenoid side chain
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Tocopherol

### Physiology

- Natural sources: As tocopherols and tocotrienols in vegetable oils and grains
- Selection of α-tocopherol in the liver: α-tocopherol transfer protein (α-TTP)
- Transport to the target cells: In the form of VLDL
- Storage: In adipose tissue
- Excretion: Via bile

### Function

- Lipophilic Antioxidants: Forms a tocopheryl radical (TO°) and thus acts as a radical scavenger to protect sensitive substances (e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids of cell membranes) from oxidation.
- Additional features
    - Inhibition of platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, and monocyte adhesion
    - Inhibition of certain proteins (e.g., protein kinase C, phospholipase A2)
    - Inhibition of the transcription of certain genes (e.g. α-TTP, α-Tropomyosin)

> [!NOTE] Vitamin E deficiency
> A vitamin E deficiency is very rare and primarily occurs in cases of genetic defects (α-TTP gene locus) or malabsorption disorders. A pronounced vitamin E deficiency leads to disturbances in neuromuscular transmission, which can manifest as spinocerebellar ataxia or myopathies.

## Vitamin K (Phylloquinone)

Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that is particularly important for blood clotting. Vitamin K antagonists (coumarins) play an important role in clinical practice for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Naphthoquinones
- Chemical lead structure: Menadione (=2-Methyl-1,4-Naphthoquinone), possibly with isoprenoid side chain
    - Vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone): Phytyl side chain
    - Vitamin K2 (Menachinon): 4–13 isoprene units
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Vitamin K hydroquinone

### Physiology

- Sources
    - As phylloquinone in green vegetables
    - Can be synthesized in small amounts by the gut flora.
- Transport protein to the target cells: No specific protein, transport via lipoproteins
- Storage: In the liver
- Excretion: Through bile and urine

> [!NOTE] Vitamin K deficiency bleeding and Vitamin K prophylaxis
> In newborns, there can be a vitamin K deficiency for several reasons: On one hand, the immature liver is not yet able to convert vitamin K into its active form; on the other hand, vitamin K is hardly transferred through the placenta. Additionally, the colonization of the intestines with vitamin K-producing bacteria is still lacking. To prevent a coagulation disorder with bleeding (vitamin K deficiency bleeding), all newborns receive vitamin K prophylaxis (one dose immediately after birth, one at U2, and one at U3).

### Function

- Cofactor for the post-translational modification (=carboxylation of glutamyl residues) in vitamin K-dependent proteins
    - Example of vitamin K-dependent proteins
        - Proteins of the coagulation system: Prothrombin (Factor II), factors VII, IX, X, Protein C, Protein S
        - Proteins of the bone matrix: For example, osteocalcin
    - Mechanism: Vitamin K serves as a cofactor for a carboxylase that converts glutamyl residues of proteins into γ-carboxy-glutamyl residues.
        1. Activation of vitamin K to vitamin K hydroquinone
        2. Carboxylation of the glutamyl residue of a vitamin K-dependent protein via γ-glutamyl carboxylase
            - Here, vitamin K hydroquinone is oxidized to vitamin K epoxide.
        3. Regeneration of vitamin K: Vitamin K epoxide is converted to vitamin K or vitamin K hydroquinone by vitamin K epoxide reductase.
    - The aim of the carboxylation of coagulation factors: Through the negatively charged carboxyl groups, the coagulation factors can bind to calcium, forming a chelate complex that mediates the binding of coagulation factors to cell membranes, thus making them activatable in the first place.

> [!NOTE]
> Coagulation factors whose synthesis depends on vitamin K: 1972 (Nine-Ten-Seven-Two) – the year of the Olympic Games in Munich!

> [!NOTE]
> The "K" in vitamin K stands for "coagulation"!

> [!NOTE] Vitamin K deficiency during antibiotic therapy
> In addition to the vitamin K from food, the body also requires the vitamin K2 synthesized by gut bacteria. A prolonged antibiotic therapy can lead to damage to the gut bacterial flora and consequently result in a deficiency of vitamin K.

> [!NOTE] Vitamin K antagonists (coumarins)
> In the prophylaxis of thromboembolic events (such as ischemic stroke or pulmonary embolism), medications that antagonize vitamin K are used by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase or vitamin K reductase, thereby impairing the synthesis of clotting factors (vitamin K antagonists or coumarin derivatives). An overdose of these vitamin K antagonists can lead to coagulopathy, which, however, only becomes apparent 3–4 days after the first dose when the previously synthesized clotting factors have been depleted.

## Water-Soluble Vitamins

Water-soluble vitamins are polar molecules that are generally not stored in the body (exception: Vitamin B12!) and are easily excreted. They primarily serve the body as cofactors in various chemical reactions.

- The water-soluble vitamins include
    - B-Vitamins
        - Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)
        - Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)
        - Niacin (formerly: Vitamin B3)
        - Pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5)
        - Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)
        - Biotin (Vitamin B7, Vitamin H)
        - Folic acid (Vitamin B9, Folate)
        - Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)
    - Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid)
- Resorption and Transport
    1. Absorption in the intestine: Uptake into enterocytes via transporters
    2. Transport in the Blood: About Various Transport Proteins

## Vitamin B1 (Thiamin)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Thiamine
- Chemical scaffold: Pyrimidine ring (6-membered ring) linked with a thiazole ring (5-membered ring)
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Thiamine pyrophosphate (=TPP; Thiamine diphosphate)

### Physiology

- Natural sources: Primarily as thiamine pyrophosphate in whole grain products, legumes, and pork.
- Resorption: About Thiamine transporter-2 (THTR2)
    - The food mainly contains thiamine pyrophosphate (active form of thiamine), which cannot be absorbed → "Deactivation" before absorption through the cleavage of pyrophosphate (PPi) by pyrophosphatases.
- Activation: Intracellular phosphorylation of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate
- Transport in the blood: Predominantly in the blood cells, only about 10% free or bound to albumin.

### Function

- Cofactor for enzymes of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, including oxidative decarboxylations
    - Pyruvate dehydrogenase: Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA
    - α-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase: α-Ketoglutarate → Succinyl-CoA (Citric Acid Cycle)
    - Transketolase: Ribose-5-phosphate + Xylulose-5-phosphate → GAP + Sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (Pentose phosphate pathway, among others in erythrocytes)
    - Degradation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine

> [!NOTE] Vitamin B1 deficiency
> Thiamine is a cofactor for various enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism; a deficiency in thiamine negatively impacts this process. Since the brain is particularly reliant on glucose, this leads to a disruption in cerebral energy supply and neurological deficits. This condition is referred to as Wernicke's encephalopathy. In this country, it primarily affects individuals with alcohol dependence, but malnutrition from other causes, cancer diseases, or surgical interventions in the digestive tract can also be causal. The patients are confused; often, coordination of eye movements and walking is impaired (ataxia). If there is no treatment with thiamine, a progression to what is known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is possible. In this defect syndrome, there is particularly a pronounced disturbance of memory retention. Furthermore, the so-called beriberi disease is known, especially from Asia, which is due to thiamine deficiency caused by a diet of polished rice. The symptoms are rather nonspecific, such as loss of appetite, fatigue, or neurological abnormalities.

## Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Flavine
- Chemical scaffold: Isoalloxazine with ribitol residue
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: riboflavin phosphate; there are two redox pairs:
    - Flavin Mononucleotide
        - FMN (oxidized form)
        - FMNH2 (reduced form)
    - Flavin-Adenine-Dinucleotide
        - FAD (oxidized form)
        - FADH2 (reduced form)

### Physiology

- Natural sources: In many animal and plant foods, especially as flavoproteins.
- Resorption
    - Intake with food as flavoproteins → In the upper GI tract, cleavage to riboflavin (only in this form absorbable)
    - Peripheral uptake into the cells is only possible as riboflavin → Intracellular re-phosphorylation to the active form
- Transport in the blood: About albumin and immunoglobulins mainly as FAD

> [!NOTE]
> Riboflavin is present in the organism in the form of the cofactors FMN and FAD!

### Function

- Cofactor of redox proteins
    - Reaction mechanism: Transfer of two electrons and two protons each
    - Occurrences (among others)
        - Oxidative deaminations (e.g. amino acid oxidases that deaminate amino acids to α-keto acids)
        - Dehydrations of CH2-CH2 groups to CH=CH groups (e.g. acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the β-oxidation of fatty acids)
        - Oxidation of aldehydes to acids (e.g., xanthine oxidase of purine metabolism)
        - Transhydrogenations (e.g. dehydrogenases of the respiratory chain and the citric acid cycle)

> [!NOTE] Vitamin B2 deficiency
> Up to 20% of older people in Europe suffer from riboflavin deficiency according to studies. Due to the diverse involvement of flavoproteins in various metabolic pathways, the symptoms are rather nonspecific. In particular, inflammations of the skin and mucous membranes (e.g. glossitis, angular stomatitis) are typical. In cases of severe deficiency, additional symptoms such as anemia, neurodegeneration, as well as impaired vision and gastrointestinal symptoms may occur.

## Niacin (formerly: Vitamin B3)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Niacin
- Chemical lead structure: Pyridine
    - Niacin: Carboxyl group
    - Nicotinamide: Acid amide group
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active forms: Pyridine nucleotide
    - Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide
        - NAD+ (oxidized form)
        - NADH (reduced form)
    - Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate
        - NADP+ (oxidized form)
        - NADPH (reduced form)

### Physiology

- Natural sources
    - Mainly in animal foods as nicotinamide
    - In smaller amounts also found in plant-based foods (especially roasted coffee beans) as niacin
- Resorption: Active resorption in the intestine (including through secondary active Na+-symporter)
- Synthesis: Niacin can be synthesized by the organism from tryptophan.
- Transport in the blood: As nicotinic acid

### Function

- Cofactor of redox enzymes
    - Reaction mechanism: Transfer of two electrons and one proton
    - Occurrence: Reduction equivalents in numerous redox reactions of metabolism (Cofactor of over 200 dehydrogenases)
        - NAD+: Especially mitochondrial dehydrogenases
        - NADP+: Primarily cytosolic dehydrogenases
    - Pharmacological effect: Nicotinic acid is sometimes used as a reserve agent for hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia (see: second-choice lipid-lowering agents)

> [!NOTE] Pellagra
> Nicotinic acid deficiency primarily occurs in population groups with a one-sided, corn-rich diet, as corn – especially untreated – is very low in niacin. If there is also a protein-poor diet, the condition can manifest even more severely, as this additionally disturbs the body's own synthesis of niacin from tryptophan. A pronounced nicotinic acid deficiency leads to the clinical picture of "pellagra," which is characterized by dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia ("the three Ds").

## Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Carboxylic acid
- Chemical lead structure: β-Alanine + Pantothenic acid
- Inactive precursor (provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Coenzyme A (CoA = Pantothenic acid + ADP + Cysteine) and phosphopantetheine

### Physiology

- Natural sources
    - As coenzyme A: Ubiquitous in nature
    - As pantothenic acid: mainly in liver, fish, meat
- Resorption: In the intestines, coenzyme A and phosphopantetheine from food are broken down into pantothenic acid and thus absorbed.
- Transport in the blood: Protein-bound

### Function

- As Coenzyme A: Activation of carboxylic acids, e.g. as
    - Acetyl-CoA: In energy, carbohydrate, amino acid, and fat metabolism, as well as in the biosynthesis of heme, acetylcholine, and steroids.
        - For example, acetylation of histone proteins
    - Acyl-CoA : In β-oxidation of fatty acids as well as for phospholipid synthesis
- As phosphopantetheine: cofactor of fatty acid synthase
## Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Pyridoxine
- Chemical lead structure: Pyridine
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)

### Physiology

- Natural sources
    - Plant-based foods: As pyridoxine and pyridoxamine in corn and yeast
    - Animal foods: Such as pyridoxal and pyridoxal phosphate in liver and poultry
- Resorption: If necessary, cleavage by intestinal phosphorylases and subsequent uptake in the intestine (rephosphorylation in the mucosal cells)
- Transport in the blood: Partly free, partly bound to albumin

### Function

As PALP, pyridoxine is an important cofactor for transaminations, decarboxylations, and eliminations, which is mainly used in amino acid metabolism.

- Mechanism of action as a cofactor in amino acid metabolism
    1. Formation of a Schiff base between the aldehyde group of PALP and the amino group of the amino acid
    2. Electron shift leads to the destabilization of one of the three bonds at the Cα-atom
    3. Course of the reaction enabled by the cofactor (Transamination, Decarboxylation, Elimination)

- Cofactor for further enzymes
    - Glycogen phosphorylase (Glycogen breakdown)
    - δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthase (Heme synthesis)

> [!NOTE]
> PALP is the most important cofactor of many enzymes in amino acid metabolism!

## Biotin (Vitamin B7; Vitamin H)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Imidazole
- Chemical lead structure: Thiophene ring fused with urea to imidazole
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active Form: Biotin
    - Typically binds as a prosthetic group to the ε-amino group of the side chain of lysine residues (e.g., in pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and propionyl-CoA carboxylase)

- Sources
    - In free form in plant-based foods (e.g. legumes, nuts)
    - Protein-bound in animal products (e.g. offal, chicken egg, salmon)
    - Can be synthesized in small amounts by the gut flora.
- Resorption: Splitting of protein-bound biotin into free biotin through the pancreatic enzyme biotinidase and subsequently active absorption in the intestine.
- Transport in the blood: Primarily free

> [!NOTE] Biotinidase deficiency
> The pancreatic enzyme biotinidase releases biotin from dietary proteins, making it usable by the body. Biotinidase is also required for the recycling of biotin within the body. If the enzyme is defective, as is the case in the extremely rare metabolic disorder "biotinidase deficiency," skin manifestations, immune system malfunctions, metabolic disturbances, and even brain damage, coma, and death can occur within the first weeks after birth. The disease should be detected as early as possible and is therefore part of newborn screening. The treatment consists of lifelong biotin supplementation.

### Function

- Cofactor of some carboxylases, transcarboxylases, and decarboxylases, e.g.:
    - Acetyl-CoA carboxylase: Transfer of the carboxyl group to acetyl-CoA during fatty acid synthesis
    - Pyruvate Carboxylase: Transfer of the carboxyl group to pyruvate during gluconeogenesis
    - Propionyl-CoA-Carboxylase: Transfer of the carboxyl group to propionyl-CoA during fatty acid degradation

> [!NOTE]
> Biotin is a cofactor in all carboxylations that are not vitamin K-dependent!

> [!NOTE] Biotin deficiency
> In case of destruction of the gut flora, such as with prolonged antibiotic therapy, a biotin deficiency may occur due to the lack of biotin-producing bacteria. This manifests as depressive mood, dermatitis, and muscle pain. Additionally, consuming large amounts of raw egg whites can lead to biotin deficiency: it contains the glycoprotein avidin, which binds biotin in the intestinal lumen and thereby hinders its absorption. Cooking can denature the heat-sensitive avidin and thus render it ineffective.

## Folic Acid (Vitamin B9; Folate)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Pteridine
- Chemical lead structure: Pterin + p-Aminobenzoic acid + Glutamate
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Tetrahydrofolate (THF)

> [!NOTE] Sulfonamide
> Sulfonamides (e.g. sulfamethoxazole) are structural analogs of p-aminobenzoic acid, a component of folic acid, and act bacteriostatically by inhibiting bacterial folic acid synthesis. Due to frequently occurring resistances, they are used as antibiotics only in combination (e.g. with dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors).

### Physiology

- Sources
    - As folic acid in green vegetables such as spinach, asparagus, beans, avocados
    - Can be synthesized in small amounts by the gut flora.
- Resorption: In the intestine via specific transporters
- Activation: Through reduction in two steps under NADPH+H+ consumption
    - Folic Acid Reductase (=Folate Reductase): Reduces folate to dihydrofolate
    - Dihydrofolate reductase (=Dihydrofolate reductase): Reduces dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate
- Transport in the blood: About folate-binding transport proteins

> [!NOTE]
> Folic acid from Latin FOLium = "leaf": Occurrence, among others, in green leafy vegetables.

### Function

- Cofactor for C1 group transfers in various synthesis and metabolic pathways
    - Transferred groups
        - Methyl groups (-CH3)
        - Formyl groups (-CHO)
        - Hydroxymethyl groups (-CH2OH)

> [!NOTE]
> A C1 group that is not transferred by folic acid is the carboxyl group (COOH)!

> [!NOTE] Folic acid deficiency
> Folate deficiency is the most common vitamin deficiency in the Western world. Folic acid acts as an important cofactor in purine and pyrimidine metabolism and therefore plays a significant role in cell division. Thus, tissues with a high mitotic rate, such as the blood-forming cells of the bone marrow, are primarily affected by folate deficiency. When there is a lack of folic acid, these cells can no longer proliferate as needed, resulting in fewer erythrocytes being produced. The erythrocytes formed are also significantly enlarged, as hemoglobin synthesis is not impaired and the synthesized hemoglobin is distributed across far fewer erythrocytes. The resulting clinical picture is referred to as "megaloblastic anemia." In particular, during pregnancy, a large amount of folic acid is needed due to the growth of the embryo. Especially in the early stages of pregnancy, a folate deficiency can lead to severe malformations of the child, ranging from spina bifida to anencephaly. Therefore, expectant mothers are advised to supplement with folic acid during pregnancy.

## Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Cobalamines
- Chemical lead structure: Cobalt complexes with corrin ligands
- Inactive precursor (provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Methylcobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin, e.g. in the form of 5'-Deoxyadenosylcobalamin as a cofactor for isomerization reactions

### Physiology

- Sources
    - Protein is primarily found in animal foods, especially in eggs, dairy products, and organ meats.
    - Can be synthesized in small amounts by the gut flora.
- Resorption
    - In the stomach: Releasing cobalamin from protein binding using pepsin and binding it to the glycoprotein haptocorrin for protection against acidic stomach pH.
    - In the duodenum: Dissolution of cobalamin from haptocorrin by trypsin and binding to intrinsic factor
    - In the terminal ileum: absorption of vitamin B12 through intrinsic factor-dependent receptor-mediated endocytosis via the cubilin receptor and binding to transcobalamin in enterocytes.
- Activation: In the liver
- Transport in the blood: Bound to Transcobalamin (Holo-Transcobalamin)
- Storage: 60% in the liver, 30% in muscle tissue

> [!NOTE]
> Vitamin B12 is the only water-soluble vitamin that is largely stored in the body!

> [!NOTE] Vegan Diet
> For people who consume a purely plant-based (vegan) diet, the vitamin B12 levels should be regularly monitored, as this vitamin is found almost exclusively in animal products!

### Function

- Cofactor in remethylations (methylcobalamin) and alkyl rearrangements (adenosylcobalamin):
    - Methionine synthase: Catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to methionine and requires methylcobalamin as a cofactor.
        - The methyl group comes from N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate.
    - Methylmalonyl-CoA-Mutase: L-Methylmalonyl-CoA → Succinyl-CoA
        - If vitamin B12 is deficient as a cofactor, accumulated L-methylmalonyl-CoA is broken down into methylmalonic acid (methylmalonate).

> [!NOTE]
> In the remethylation of homocysteine, cobalamin works closely with folic acid; therefore, a deficiency in either of the two vitamins is indicated by elevated homocysteine levels!

> [!NOTE] Vitamin B12 deficiency
> A vitamin B12 deficiency can develop due to insufficient intake (malnutrition, strict vegan diet), a lack of intrinsic factor (e.g., in chronic atrophic gastritis), or intestinal diseases with reduced vitamin B12 absorption (e.g., in ileitis). However, in individuals who consume a "normal" mixed diet, there are reserves in the liver that contain about 1000 times the daily requirement of vitamin B12. Therefore, a deficiency only becomes apparent after several years. A typical symptom is pernicious anemia (a maturation disorder of blood formation) with increased MCV and MCH, as well as funicular myelosis (degeneration of the myelin sheaths of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord). Due to the failure of methionine synthase, tetrahydrofolate can only be inadequately regenerated. This leads to an accumulation of N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and a deficiency of tetrahydrofolate, disrupting DNA synthesis and resulting in macrocytic, hyperchromic anemia. Measuring the vitamin B12 level is less suitable for detecting a deficiency, as serum levels may still be within the normal range despite a deficiency. It is better to measure decreased holo-transcobalamin or increased methylmalonic acid levels in the blood.

## Vitamin C (Ascorbate)

### Chemical Fundamentals

- Substance class: Lactone
- Chemical lead structure: Vinylogue carboxylic acid
- Inactive precursor (Provitamin): ∅
- Active form: Ascorbate (Ascorbic acid)

### Physiology

- Natural sources: Primarily in fruits and vegetables as ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid
- Resorption
    - Passive resorption through the oral mucosa
    - Active absorption through the intestine (especially in the jejunum)
        - By means of a secondary-active Na+-symporter (SVCT): Ascorbate
        - By means of Na+-independent glucose transporter (GLUT): As dehydroascorbic acid followed by reduction to ascorbate
    - Promotion of iron absorption in the intestine by vitamin C
        - As a metal chelator: Improved iron solubility through the formation of a chelate complex
        - As a redox partner: Reduction of poorly soluble Fe3+ to well-soluble Fe2+
- Transport in the blood: Primarily in the form of free ascorbate, only to a very small extent as dehydroascorbate.
- Storage: No special vitamin C storage, but particularly high concentration in the organs where it is needed as a cofactor (e.g. adrenal gland)

### Function

- Hydrophilic Antioxidants: Ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid together serve as a redox system.
    - Protects sensitive substances (e.g. lipids in blood plasma) from oxidation as a radical scavenger.
- Cofactor of important enzymatic reactions, e.g.:
    - Collagen synthesis: Hydroxylation of proline and lysine
    - Norepinephrine synthesis: Hydroxylation of dopamine
    - Carnitine synthesis
    - Peptide hormone formation from prohormones (e.g., Vasopressin, Calcitonin, Oxytocin)

> [!NOTE] Scurvy
> Since ascorbic acid is found in many foods, a manifest deficiency is rare. The symptoms of such a deficiency primarily arise due to insufficient hydroxylation during collagen synthesis. For example, this can lead to tooth loss, reduced strength of connective tissue and bones, gum bleeding, and pinpoint skin bleeding (petechiae). The resulting clinical picture is referred to as "scurvy." It was previously common among sailors who consumed an extremely one-sided and vitamin-poor diet for extended periods.

## Review Questions for the Chapter on Vitamins
### Fat-Soluble Vitamins

Describe the chemical structure of beta-carotene!  
- The provitamin beta-carotene is a so-called tetraterpene, as it is composed of 4 terpene units.  
How is the transport of fat-soluble retinol in the blood plasma from the liver to the target cells carried out?  
- Retinol is transported predominantly bound to RBP (retinol-binding protein) from the liver to the target cells.  
Describe the mechanism of action and the effects of retinoic acid!  
- Retinoic acid binds to special receptors in the cell nucleus, the so-called ligand-activated transcription factors, and thereby influences the expression of various genes that are important for cell growth and differentiation, reproduction, and embryogenesis.  
How do retinal and retinoic acid differ chemically from each other?  
- Retinal is an aldehyde; by oxidation, it forms the carboxylic acid retinoic acid.  
Describe the body's own synthesis and activation of vitamin D, including the sites of formation of the precursors!  
- In the liver, 7-dehydrocholesterol is formed from cholesterol. This is stored in the skin. UV rays cleave the stored 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol. Cholecalciferol is hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. In the kidneys, it is activated by hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol.  
What functions does vitamin D serve in the organism?  
- Vitamin D increases calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestine and kidneys; furthermore, it promotes bone mineralization.  
What is Calbindin and how is its production induced?  
- Calbindin is a transport protein for calcium, whose formation in the intestine is promoted by calcitriol (vitamin D).  
What function does vitamin K serve in the organism?  
- Vitamin K is a cofactor for the carboxylation of glutamyl residues of certain proteins, e.g., coagulation factors such as prothrombin (factor II), factors VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S.  
### Water-Soluble Vitamins

What is the active form of vitamin B1 and in which reactions is it involved as a cofactor?  
- The active form of vitamin B1 is thiamine pyrophosphate. It plays a role especially as a cofactor in oxidative decarboxylations. Additionally, it is involved in the transketolase reaction.  
What diseases are caused by a vitamin B1 deficiency?  
- Vitamin B1 deficiency can lead to Wernicke encephalopathy, which can progress to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome if untreated. Furthermore, the so-called beriberi disease can arise from nutritional thiamine deficiency.  
What is the active form of pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5)?  
- The active form of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is coenzyme A (CoA = pantothenic acid + ADP + cysteine). Thus, vitamin B5 is part of activated acetic acid, also known as acetyl-CoA.  
What is the active form of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) called and what is its importance?  
- The active form of vitamin B6 is pyridoxal phosphate (PALP). It is widely used as an important cofactor for transaminations, decarboxylations, and eliminations (especially in amino acid metabolism).  
What is the first step in transamination?  
- A transamination begins with the formation of a Schiff base between the aldehyde group of PALP and the amino group of the amino acid.  
What is the active form of Vitamin B7 and what is its purpose in the body?  
- The active form of vitamin B7 is biotin. It is the most important prosthetic group of carboxylases (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase).  
Although biotin is found in chicken eggs, excessive consumption of raw egg whites can lead to biotin deficiency – why?  
- Raw chicken egg white contains a protein (avidin) which binds biotin with high affinity and thus prevents its absorption in the intestine.  
To which class of substances does folic acid (vitamin B9) belong?  
- The heterocycle in the folic acid molecule is called pteridine.  
Which antibiotics inhibit the biosynthesis of folic acid?  
- Sulfonamides primarily inhibit the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, thereby secondarily inhibiting the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases and thus also the DNA replication, transcription, and translation of bacteria.  
What function does tetrahydrofolate serve in the organism?  
- Tetrahydrofolate serves as a cofactor for C1 group transfers in various synthesis and metabolic pathways.  
Describe the absorption of vitamin B12!  
- Vitamin B12 is cleaved from its protein binding by pepsin in the stomach and bound to haptocorrin for protection against stomach acid. In the duodenum, it is released from haptocorrin by trypsin and bound again to intrinsic factor. Subsequently, it is absorbed in the terminal ileum via receptor-mediated endocytosis and bound to transcobalamin in the enterocytes.  
Which essential amino acid is regenerated with the help of vitamin B12?  
- Vitamin B12 serves as a cofactor, for example, in regenerating the essential amino acid methionine. Methionine synthase catalyzes, using the cofactor methylcobalamin, the methylation of homocysteine to methionine. The methyl group is derived from N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate.  
What role does vitamin B12 play in the β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids?  
- In the β-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the reaction of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA with the help of vitamin B12 as a cofactor.  
Which vitamin deficiency do vegetarians or vegans most likely develop, and how or when is this likely to manifest?  
- Vitamin B12 is almost exclusively protein-bound in animal foods (especially in eggs, dairy products, and offal); therefore, prolonged avoidance of these foods can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency. Since the liver stores about 1,000 times the daily requirement of vitamin B12, deficiency symptoms manifest only after several years as pernicious anemia with increased MCV and MCH and possibly with funicular myelosis.  
How is vitamin C absorbed in the intestine?  
- Vitamin C is absorbed as ascorbate mainly in the jejunum via a secondary active Na+ symporter (SVCT).  
What function does vitamin C serve in the organism?  
- Vitamin C is a cofactor in important enzymatic reactions, e.g., in collagen synthesis (hydroxylation of proline and lysine).
