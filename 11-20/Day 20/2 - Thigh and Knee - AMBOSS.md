# Thigh and Knee
## Summary

The thigh is the proximal part of the lower extremity: It is connected to the lower leg via the knee and to the trunk via the hip joint. The supporting bone of the thigh is the femur. It consists of the femoral neck with the femoral head and the shaft, which form an angle of 125° with each other. Distally, the femur transitions into the knee joint, which is one of the largest joints of the human body. The knee joint is stabilized by two collateral and two cruciate ligaments and has two cartilage discs, the menisci, which ensure even force transmission. Through a common joint capsule, the knee joint is connected to the femoropatellar joint between the femur and the patella. The patella is a sesamoid bone embedded in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, the only extensor in the knee joint. Other important muscle groups include the adductors located medially on the thigh and the flexors located dorsally.
## Bones

The thigh is supported by a single bone: the femur. In the area of the knee joint, there is also the patella, which is embedded in the tendon of the quadriceps femoris.

### Femur

- Proximal section
    - Femoral head (Oberschenkelkopf): Supports the hemispherical articular surface for the hip joint
        - Fovea capitis femoris
    - Femoral neck (Oberschenkelhals)
    - Greater trochanter and lesser trochanter
        - Intertrochanteric crest: Attachment point of the M. quadratus femoris
        - Trochanteric fossa
- Thigh shaft: Femoral body
    - Carries the following structures dorsally
        - Gluteal tuberosity: Attachment point of the M. gluteus maximus
        - Pectineal line
        - Linea aspera
            - Medial lip
            - Lateral lip
        - Medial supracondylar line and lateral supracondylar line
            - Between the popliteal fossa
- Distal section: The distal femur consists of the two femoral condyles and the epicondyles that are located cranially above them.
    - Lateral epicondyle
    - Medial epicondyle with adductor tubercle
    - Lateral femoral condyle and medial femoral condyle: Carry the articular surfaces of the knee joint
    - Between the intercondylar line and the intercondylar fossa

> [!NOTE]
> Between the femoral neck and the shaft, there is normally an angle of about 125° (the so-called collum-diaphyseal angle). If this angle is decreased, it is called Coxa vara; if it is increased, Coxa valga!

> [!NOTE] Femoral neck fracture  
> Due to a lack of vitamin D intake during youth, the condition of rickets leads to the development of excessively soft bones (osteomalacia). As a result, the femoral neck gives way, and the collum-diaphysis angle decreases - a coxa vara develops. Affected individuals present with leg shortening and the so-called Duchenne limp: In this case, the hip cannot be held horizontally during single-leg standing and drops on the affected side, while the upper body leans compensatorily to the opposite side. The Duchenne limp arises from an insufficiency of the small gluteal muscles, which attach at the greater trochanter. Due to the relatively high position of the trochanter in coxa vara, it can no longer optimally exert its force.

> [!NOTE] Femoral neck fracture
> One of the most common fractures in the elderly is the femoral neck fracture. It usually occurs from falls onto the hip and leads to painful shortening and external rotation of the affected leg. Since it can be very dangerous for older people to be immobilized for long periods, unstable fractures are treated surgically, for example, with a dual-head prosthesis.

### Patella

The patella is a disc-shaped bone and technically belongs to the sesamoid bones. It is embedded to facilitate better force transmission into the tendon of the M. quadriceps femoris.

- Proximal: Base of the patella
- Mittig
    - Anterior surface
    - Articular surface of the patella
- Distal: Apex of the patella

> [!NOTE] Tanzende Patella
> Directly below the patella is the common joint capsule of the femoropatellar and knee joint. If trauma or inflammation in the joint leads to fluid accumulation in the joint capsule (joint effusion), the patella "floats" on this fluid cushion. In the clinical examination, one can make use of this phenomenon, referred to as "dancing patella" (tanzende Patella), to demonstrate a joint effusion.

## Knee Joint (Art. genus)

The knee joint connects the upper and lower leg and is one of the largest joints in the human body. The knee joint can be divided into a femorotibial joint and a femoropatellar joint, which will be discussed together in the following sections.

- Definition: Joint, that connects the thigh with the lower leg
- Joint type: Pivot hinge joint
- Function: Flexion and extension of the knee as well as slight rotation
    - Femoropatellar joint (Femoropatellargelenk): Reinforcement of the lever action of the M. quadriceps femoris
    - Femorotibial joint (Femorotibial joint)
        - Extension/Flexion: 5–10°/0°/about 150°
        - Rotation with a bent knee: Approximately 40° external and 10° internal rotation
- Movement sequence during extension
    1. First, a rolling and sliding motion (translational motion) of the femoral condyles on the tibial plateau
    2. Then sole rolling of the condyles on the tibial plateau
    3. Finally, external rotation of the lower leg by about 5° (“final rotation”)
- Involved Structures
    - Bones: Femur, Tibia, Patella
    - Soft tissue
        - Ligaments and menisci: See next section
        - Knee joint capsule: Common joint capsule of the two joint components
        - Bursae: Due to the numerous muscle attachments, there are several bursae at the knee.
        - Infrapatellar fat pad (Hoffa's fat pad): A cushion of fat between the apex of the patella, the patellar ligament, and the tibia

> [!NOTE] Knee deformities
> If the knee joint is not aligned with the hip and the ankle joint, the weight is unevenly distributed across the two condyles, which can lead to signs of wear and tear (osteoarthritis) relatively early. If the knee is positioned too far medially (X-legs or also genu valgum), the lateral condyle and the lateral meniscus are particularly stressed. If it is positioned too far laterally (O-legs or also genu varum), the medial condyle and the medial meniscus are affected. Therapeutically, a so-called corrective osteotomy can correct the joint axes. However, it must be noted that a misalignment in the hip can also lead to a compensatory misalignment of the knee.

## Ligaments and Menisci

To ensure stability, the femur and tibia are connected by the cruciate and collateral ligaments. The incongruent joint surfaces of the femur and tibia are aligned with each other by the menisci coated with cartilage.

### Cruciate Ligaments

The cruciate ligaments stabilize the knee joint throughout the entire range of motion, as their components are tense in every position. During internal rotation, they "wrap around" each other, while during external rotation they are "unwound." They lie between the synovial membrane and the fibrous membrane and thus are intracapsular but extrasynovial.

- Anterior cruciate ligament (anterior cruciate ligament): Runs from the upper back lateral (medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle) to the lower front medial (anterior intercondylar area of the tibia) and crosses the posterior cruciate ligament at an angle of 90°.
- Posterior cruciate ligament (posterior cruciate ligament): Runs from the upper front medial (lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle) to the lower back lateral (posterior intercondylar area of the tibia)

### Other Bands

- Collateral ligaments: They are tense when the leg is extended (which prevents the knee joint from opening) and relaxed when bent (which allows for rotation in the knee).
    - Tibial collateral ligament (medial ligament)
        - It is fused with the joint capsule and the medial meniscus.
        - Runs from the medial epicondyle to the medial surface of the tibia
    - Lateral collateral ligament (lateral side ligament)
        - Runs from the lateral epicondyle to the head of the fibula
- Lig. patellae: Represents the portion of the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle located distal to the patella.
    - Course: From Apex patellae to Tibial tuberosity
    - Function: Improvement of leverage and reduction of effort for the contraction of the M. quadriceps femoris. In this context, the Lig. patellae cannot be considered in isolation. The mechanical advantages are achieved through the interplay between the Lig. patellae and the Patella, which acts as a sesamoid bone.
- Medial retinaculum of the patella and lateral retinaculum of the patella
    - Composed of tendon fibers from the M. quadriceps femoris
    - History
        - Longitudinal sections: Medial and lateral of the patella to the medial or lateral tibial condyle
        - Transverse shares: Medial and lateral of the patella to the patella and to the tibial collateral ligament or fibular collateral ligament
    - Function: Reserve stretch apparatus

### Meniscus

The menisci of the knee are attached to the area intercondylaris and compensate for the differences between the flat tibial and the round femoral articular surface.

- Medial meniscus (inner meniscus)
    - Form: Resembles a laterally opened C
    - Special feature: Adhered to the medial collateral ligament and therefore less mobile
- Lateral meniscus (lateral meniscus)
    - Form: Resembles a medially opened ring
    - Special feature: No fixation on the side band, making it more flexible and less susceptible to injuries.

#### Macroscopic Shares

- Anterior horn (Cornu anterius)
- Intermediate lobe
- Hinterhorn (Cornu posterius)

> [!NOTE] Unhappy Triad
> If one of the cruciate ligaments is torn, the knee joint becomes unstable. In the clinical examination, this is tested using the anterior and posterior drawer tests: In the case of a cruciate ligament tear, the lower leg can be shifted against the thigh with the leg bent. A forward shift indicates a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, while a backward shift indicates a lesion of the posterior cruciate ligament.

> [!NOTE] Unhappy Triad
> In ski accidents, it is common for ligament injuries of the knee to occur. Particularly unfavorable is the so-called “Unhappy Triad,” in which the anterior cruciate ligament, the medial collateral ligament, and the medial meniscus are damaged. This occurs during forced bending and external rotation of the knee, when the knee is additionally in a knock-kneed position (so-called valgus stress).

## Muscles

The musculature of the thigh can be functionally divided into three groups: The adductors are located medially and perform adduction at the hip joint. The extensors are located ventrally and are responsible for extending the knee. The flexors are located dorsally and flex the knee.

### Adductors

The adductors are all innervated by the N. obturatorius, perform adduction at the hip joint, and almost all attach to the posterior side of the femur at the linea aspera or pectineal line. The origins vary, but they all lie in the caudal region of the hip bones os pubis and os ischiadicum.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. pectineus|- Pecten of the pubic bone|- Pectineal line|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - External rotation<br>    - Flexion|- N. obturatorius (L2–L4) and<br>- N. femoralis|
|M. obturatorius externus|- Obturator membrane|- Trochanteric fossa|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - External rotation|- N. obturatorius (L2–L4)|
|M. adductor longus|- R. superior pubic bone<br>- Symphysis|- Linea aspera (Medial lip)|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Weak external or internal rotation|
|M. adductor brevis|- R. inferior of the pubic bone|
|M. adductor magnus|- R. inferior of the pubic bone<br>- R. of the ischium<br>- Ischial tuberosity|- Linea aspera (Medial lip)<br>- Medial epicondyle of the femur|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - External rotation<br>    - Extension|- N. obturatorius (L2–L4)<br>- N. tibialis (L4–L5)|
|M. adductor minimus|- R. inferior of the pubic bone|- Linea aspera (Medial lip)|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - External rotation<br>    - Flexion|- N. obturatorius (L2–L4)|
|M. gracilis|- R. inferior of the pubic bone|- In the superficial pes anserinus (medial of the tibial tuberosity)|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - Flexion<br>- Knee joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Internal rotation|

> [!NOTE]
> The Mm. adductor longus, brevis, magnus, and minimus all attach to the medial lip of the Linea aspera!

> [!NOTE]
> All adductors are innervated by the obturator nerve!

### Ventral Muscle Group

The ventral muscles of the thigh include the M. quadriceps femoris and the M. sartorius, both of which are innervated by the N. femoralis. The M. quadriceps femoris is the only extensor of the knee joint.

|Name|   |Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. quadriceps femoris|M. rectus femoris|- Anterior inferior iliac spine|- Tibial tuberosity|- Hip joint: Flexion<br>- Knee joint: Extension|- N. femoralis (L2–L4)|
|M. vastus medialis|- Line aspera (Medial lip)|- Knee joint: Extension|
|M. vastus intermedius|- Front of the femur|
|M. vastus lateralis|- Line aspera (Lateral lip)<br>    <br>- Greater trochanter|
|M. sartorius|   |- Anterior superior iliac spine|- On the superficial pes anserinus (medial to the tibial tuberosity)|- Hip joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - External rotation<br>    - Abduction<br>- Knee joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Internal rotation|

> [!NOTE]
> The M. sartorius is also called the tailor's muscle because it performs the movements necessary to achieve the cross-legged position in the hip and knee joint: the knee and hip are bent, the knee is rotated inward, and the hip is rotated outward and abducted!

> [!NOTE]
> In the tendon of the M. quadriceps femoris is a sesamoid bone, the patella, embedded. The area of the tendon between the patella and the tibial tuberosity is therefore also called Lig. patellae!

> [!NOTE]
> The M. quadriceps femoris is the only extensor in the knee joint!

> [!NOTE] Nerve-femoral-lesion
> Since the femoral nerve innervates the strongest flexors in the hip joint and all extensors in the knee joint, a nerve lesion leads to massive restrictions in movement: The hip can no longer be flexed, and the knee can no longer be extended. While walking, the affected knee cannot be stabilized and gives way. A possible cause of such a lesion could be, for example, a hematoma of the iliopsoas muscle, through which the femoral nerve runs between its parts.

### Dorsal Muscle Group (Flexors)

The flexor group is innervated by the tibial nerve with the exception of the short head of the biceps femoris. All muscles perform a flexion at the knee joint.

|Name|   |Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. biceps femoris|Short head|- Linea aspera (Lateral lip)|- Fibula head|- Hip joint (only long head)<br>    - Extension<br>- Knee joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - External rotation|- N. fibularis (L5–S2)|
|Long head|- Ischial tuberosity|- Tibial nerve (L5–S2)|
|M. semitendinosus|   |- On the superficial pes anserinus (medial to the tibial tuberosity)|- Hip joint<br>    - Extension<br>- Knee joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Internal rotation|
|M. semimembranosus|   |- In Deep anserine bursa (Medial condyle of the tibia)|
|M. popliteus|   |- Lateral condyle of the femur|- Posterior surface of the tibia|- Knee joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Internal rotation|

> [!NOTE]
> The long head of the M. biceps femoris, the M. semimembranosus, and the M. semitendinosus originate from the tuber ischiadicum and insert on the lower leg. They are therefore referred to as ischiocrural muscles!

> [!NOTE]
> The most important external rotator in the knee joint is the M. biceps femoris, while the most important internal rotators are the Mm. semimembranosus and semitendinosus!

### Superficial and Deep Pes Anserinus

The two so-called goose feet are tendon structures in the area of the medial knee joint.

- Superficial pes anserinus: Is located medially to the tibial tuberosity
    - Ansatz for the Mm. sartorius, semitendinosus, and gracilis
- Pes anserinus profundus: It is located dorsal behind the medial condyle of the tibia.
    - It forms from the origin of the M. semimembranosus, whose tendon transitions into three connective tissue strands (To medial condyle of the tibia, Lig. popliteum obliquum and to the fascia of the M. popliteus)

### M. tensor fasciae latae and iliotibial tract

The fascia lata is a band of dense connective tissue that extends from the ilium to the lower leg. In the area of the lateral thigh, it is reinforced to form the iliotibial tract. The iliotibial tract counteracts the flexion forces acting on the femur that arise due to the angled position of the femur in relation to the body axis (the so-called tension band principle).

- Course: From Os ilium to the lateral tibial condyle
- Components: fascia of the thigh, tendons of the gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae
- Function: Balancing the bending forces according to the principle of tension bracing
## Vascular Supply and Innervation

This section provides an overview of the vascular supply and innervation of the thigh. For more detailed information on the involved vessels and nerves, see: Pathways of the Lower Extremity.

|Vessel Supply|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Arterial|   |- Femoral head<br>    - Medial femoral circumflex artery and lateral from Deep femoral artery<br>    - A. capitis femoris from Obturator artery<br>- Femoral shaft<br>    - Femoral artery from External iliac artery<br>        - Deep femoral artery<br>        - Popliteal artery|
|Venous|   |- Femoral Vein in External Iliac Vein<br>    - Popliteal Vein<br>    - Great Saphenous Vein|
|Innervation|   |   |
|Motor|   |- Femoral Nerve<br>- Obturator Nerve<br>- Tibial Nerve|
|Sensory|   |- N. cutaneus femoris posterior from Plexus sacralis<br>- N. cutaneus femoris lateralis from Plexus lumbalis<br>- Rr. cutanei femoris anteriores of N. femoralis<br>- R. cutaneus of N. obturatorius<br>- R. femoralis of N. genitofemoralis|

> [!NOTE] Femoral head necrosis in femoral neck fracture 
> The blood supply of the femoral head has special clinical significance. In the case of a fracture of the femoral neck, it can lead to interruption of the blood supply by the A. circumflexa femoris. Since the small A. capitis femoris is insufficient to supply the femoral head, it can die. A joint replacement is usually unavoidable in such a case of necrosis of the femoral head.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Thigh and Knee
### Bone

Which bony structure of the femur serves as an attachment point for the gluteus maximus muscle?
- The Tuberositas glutea is located on the proximal, dorsal femoral shaft and forms the attachment point for the caudal tendons of the M. gluteus maximus.
### Knee joint (Art. genus)

What typical misalignments of the knee joint do you know of, and what wear and tear can they lead to?
- If the knee joint is not aligned in one axis with the hip and ankle joint, the weight is unevenly distributed on the two condyles and wear symptoms (osteoarthritis) can occur. If the knee is too far medial (knock-knees or also Genu valgum), the lateral condyle and the lateral meniscus are particularly stressed. If it is too far lateral (bowlegs or also Genu varum), the medial condyle and the medial meniscus are rather affected.
What is the function of the two menisci and to which bony structure are they attached?
- The menisci of the knee are attached in the intercondylar area between the condyles of the tibial head and compensate for the differences between the flat tibial and the round femoral joint surfaces.
### Muscles

Name the adductors of the thigh! How are they innervated?
- The following muscles belong to the adductors of the thigh: M. pectineus, M. obturatorius externus, M. gracilis as well as the Mm. adductores longus, brevis, magnus, and minimus. All adductors of the thigh are innervated by the N. obturatorius, while the Mm. pectineus and adductor magnus are additionally supplied by the N. femoralis and N. tibialis.
Where is the origin and insertion of the M. sartorius? What function does it have in the hip and knee joint and how is it innervated?
- The M. sartorius runs from the Spina iliaca anterior superior to the Pes anserinus superficialis on the medial tibia. It causes flexion both in the hip and in the knee joint. Since these are the movements needed for the tailor's sitting position, it is also called the "tailor muscle." It also supports the external rotation and abduction of the thigh and the internal rotation of the lower leg. It is innervated by the N. femoralis.
What is the iliotibial tract? Describe its course and function!
- The Tractus iliotibialis is a reinforcement of the lateral thigh fascia and consists of the cranial part of the tendons of the M. gluteus maximus and the tendons of the M. tensor fasciae latae. It runs from the Os ilium to the lateral tibial condyle and acts as a compensatory force against the bending stress of the femur ("tensile band principle").
Where are the origin and insertion of the rectus femoris muscle? What movement does it perform at the hip and knee joint?
- The M. rectus femoris is part of the M. quadriceps femoris. It originates at the Spina iliaca anterior inferior and inserts together with the other heads of the M. quadriceps femoris at the Tuberositas tibiae. It causes extension in the knee joint and flexion in the hip joint.
Which muscles cause the strongest internal or external rotation in the knee joint?
- The most important and at the same time only external rotator in the knee joint is the M. biceps femoris, the most important internal rotators are the Mm. semimembranosus and semitendinosus.
Which structures form the pes anserinus superficialis and where is it located?
- The superficial pes anserinus (goose foot) is a fan-shaped tendon plate on the medial condyle of the tibia. The insertion tendons of the Mm. sartorius, semitendinosus, and gracilis come together in it before they radiate into the medial tibia.
