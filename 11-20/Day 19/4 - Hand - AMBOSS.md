# Hand
## Summary

The hand is anatomically very complex with its numerous bones, joints and small muscles. The wrist consists of eight bones, which are connected to the forearm bones through the wrist joint and to the metacarpal bones via the taut carpometacarpal joint. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb has a special significance: as a saddle joint, it allows for complex grasping movements. The associated muscles are located in the thenar and hypothenar eminences. The intrinsic muscles are responsible for spreading the fingers. Clinically, the carpal tunnel is of particular importance, as it provides a protected pathway for the median nerve in the area of the wrist.
## Bones

### Wrist (Carpus)

- Eight bones: Four bones of the proximal and four of the distal row
- They form a concave depression on the palm, covered by the flexor muscle retinaculum of the hand
    - The osteofibrous canal formed this way is called the carpal canal

#### Proximal Series

The proximal row of the carpal bones contains the following bones from radial to ulnar:

- The scaphoid (Kahnbein)
- The lunate bone (moon bone)
- The triquetrum (triquetral bone)
- The pisiform bone (Pisiform bone)
    - Smallest carpal bone
    - Sesame bone of the M. flexor carpi ulnaris

> [!NOTE] Carpal Bone Fracture  
> In the case of a fall onto an outstretched hand, a fracture of the scaphoid bone can occur. It is the most common among the fractures of the carpal bones. Specific symptoms include swelling and pain at the wrist, especially a tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox. In particular, fractures in the proximal third of the scaphoid heal slowly due to poorer blood supply in that area, which necessitates a longer immobilization compared to other fractures.

#### Distal Series

The distal row of the carpal bones contains the following bones from radial to ulnar:

- The trapezium (large polygon bone): Groove for the M. flexor carpi radialis
- The trapezoid bone (small polygonal bone)
- The capitate bone (Kopfbein)
    - Largest carpal bone
    - Center of the Lig. carpi radiatum
- The hamate bone (Hook bone): Has a bony projection on the palmar side (Hamulus ossis hamati).

> [!NOTE]
> "A boat that sailed in the moonlight in a triangle around the Pisiform. A large polygon, a small polygon, the head must be on the hook!" or alternatively with the Latin names: "Some Lovers Try Positions That They Can't Handle!"

### Metacarpal bones (MHC, Ossa metacarpalia)

- Three sections
    - Basis of the metacarpal bone: Articulates with the carpal bones
    - Corpus ossis metacarpi: Long elongated bone body
    - Head of the metacarpal bone: Articulates with the finger bones
        - Visible on the back of the hand as a knuckle
- Interosseous space of the metacarpus: Space between two metacarpal bones

### Finger bones (Phalanges, Bones of the fingers)

The thumb consists of two, the long fingers of the hand consist of three finger bones.

- Phalanx proximalis (proximal phalanx): Longest finger bone
- Phalanx media (middle phalanx): Missing in the thumb
- Phalanx distal (distal phalanx)
## Joints

### Wrists

The wrists include not only the proximal and distal wrist but also the joints between adjacent carpal bones (intercarpal articulations) and the joints between the carpal bones and the metacarpal bones (carpometacarpal articulations).

#### Proximal Wrist (Radiocarpal Joint)

- Involved structures: The trapezium and metacarpal bone I

> [!NOTE] Rhizarthrosis
> Due to the loose joint guidance, the saddle joint of the thumb is particularly susceptible to signs of wear of the cartilage (osteoarthritis). About 10% of women and 1% of men suffer from the so-called rhizarthrosis with age. This is usually accompanied by pain during gripping and twisting movements and swelling at the base of the thumb. Therapeutically, for example, a removal of the os trapezium may be performed.

### Finger Joints

The finger joints are divided into proximal, middle, and distal joints. The thumb is the exception here: it has only a proximal and an interphalangeal joint. The ligaments collateralia and palmaria stabilize the joint capsule of all finger joints.

#### Metacarpophalangeal Joints II to V (Articulationes metacarpophalangeales)

## Muscles

The short hand muscles can be divided into the radial thenar, the ulnar hypothenar, and the interjacent midpalmar muscles. All short hand muscles are innervated either by the median nerve or by the ulnar nerve. The long hand muscles are located in the area of the forearm and are explained there (see: forearm).

### Thenar Musculature

The shape of the thenar eminence is primarily determined by the abductor pollicis brevis muscle.

## Fascia and Tendon Sheaths

### Dorsal aponeurosis

- Definition: Flat tendon of the sides and backs of the fingers (continuation of the tendons of the long extensors as well as in fingers II–V of the Mm. interossei and Mm. lumbricales)
### Palmar Aponeurosis (Palmar Aponeurosis)

- Definition: Aponeurosis of the palm
- Limitations
    - Proximal
        - Retinaculum flexorum
        - Fibers of the M. palmaris longus and the M. palmaris brevis (these tense the palmar aponeurosis during contraction)
    - Distal: Capitis metacarpal bones I–V
    - Palmar: Fused with the skin of the palm side of the hand.

> [!NOTE] Dupuytren's Contracture
> In the context of the so-called Dupuytren's contracture, there is an increase in connective tissue in the palmar aponeurosis. Particularly in the area of the little finger, the aponeurosis is then palpable as a cord-like, nodular structure to palpate. In the further course, there is a fixation of the finger joints in a flexed position. Also, pain can occur when nerves and vessels are irritated. The therapeutic options are very limited due to a high recurrence rate.

### Tendon Compartments of the Extensors

- Definition
    - 6 tendon compartments for the extensor muscles of the hand and fingers
    - Located in the area of the dorsal wrist
    - Covered by the extensor retinaculum
- Tendon compartments (from radial to ulnar)
    - 1. Muscle: M. extensor pollicis brevis and M. abductor pollicis longus
    - 2. Subject: M. extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis
    - 3. Subject: M. extensor pollicis longus
    - 4. Muscle: M. extensor digitorum and M. extensor indicis
    - 5. Subject: M. extensor digiti minimi
    - 6. Subject: M. extensor carpi ulnaris

### Carpal Sheaths of the Flexors [1][2]

- Definition: Tendon sheaths of the flexor tendons beneath the flexor retinaculum
- Tendon compartments
    - 1. Subject: M. flexor carpi radialis
    - 2. Subject: M. flexor pollicis longus
    - 3. Subject: M. flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus

> [!NOTE] V-Phlegmon
> An inflammation of the tendon sheath of the thumb flexor (M. flexor pollicis longus) can spread to the tendon sheath of the little finger flexor. The tendon sheaths of the flexors of the thumb and little finger are usually continuous from the wrist to the fingertip, while the tendon sheaths of the flexors of fingers 2–4 are interrupted! This results in the name “V-phlegmon” due to the V-shaped inflammatory process (between the thumb, little finger, and carpus).

### Extensor Retinaculum and Flexor Retinaculum (Flexor Retinaculum of the Hand)

- Extensor retinaculum: So-called restraining band in the area of the dorsal wrist
    - Increased fiber tension of the forearm fascia
    - Serves the power transmission of the finger extensor
- Retinaculum flexorum: A wide, strong band between the Os scaphoideum and the Os trapezium on the radial side and the Hamulus ossis hamati and the Os pisiforme on the ulnar side.
    - Serves the flexor muscles as a counterbalance for force transmission
    - It forms the roof of the carpal tunnel
## Vascular Supply and Innervation

For more precise information about the involved vessels and nerves, see also: Conduits of the upper extremity.

|Vessel Supply|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Arterial|   |- A. radialis and A. ulnaris both arise from A. brachialis and form many anastomoses in the hand area<br>    - Dorsal carpal rete<br>    - Deep palmar arch<br>        - Runs together with the R. profundus of the N. ulnaris<br>    - Superficial palmar arch|
|Venous|   |- Dorsal venous network of the hand in V. cephalica|
|Innervation|   |   |
|Motor/Sensory|   |- Median Nerve<br>- Radial Nerve<br>- Ulnar Nerve|
> [!NOTE] Allen-Test
> The arteries in the area of the wrist are particularly well suited for an arterial puncture. To avoid jeopardizing the blood supply to the hand, the patency of the anastomoses should be checked beforehand. This is done, for example, using the so-called Allen test: First, the radial artery and ulnar artery are compressed, and the hand is "emptied" by repeated fist closure until it turns white. Then one of the two vessels is released, and the blood flow to the hand is assessed based on its coloration. If the entire hand quickly turns pink, the Allen test is unremarkable and the anastomoses are intact. If it remains at least partially pale, the Allen test is pathological; puncture should be avoided.

> [!NOTE] Leadership Anesthesia According to Oberst
> For minor surgical procedures on the finger, a local anesthesia of the corresponding finger may be sufficient. For this purpose, the so-called nerve block according to Oberst is suitable, for example: The finger is punctured distal to the metacarpophalangeal joint, and the cannula is advanced palmarly. By injecting a local anesthetic such as lidocaine into the surrounding tissue, both the dorsal and palmar nerves are blocked, numbing the entire finger. Since the muscles that move the finger are located proximal to the injection site, the finger can still be moved. The procedure can also be applied to interventions on the toes.

## Topography

In the area of the palmar wrist, the carpal bones form a hollow where important structures of the hand run. The flexor retinaculum divides this hollow into the carpal tunnel and the small ulnar-sided Guyon's canal.

### Carpal Tunnel (Carpal Tunnel, Carpal Canal)

- Definition: The carpal tunnel is an osteofibrous tunnel located ventrally to the carpal bones that carries the median nerve and some flexor tendons from the forearm to the palm.
- Limitations
    - Ventral: Flexor Retinaculum
    - Dorsal and lateral: Carpal bones
- Structures in the Carpal Tunnel
    - N. medianus
    - Muscle tendons (each in tendon sheaths) of:
        - M. flexor pollicis longus
        - M. flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus

> [!NOTE]
> The M. flexor carpi ulnaris attaches at the Os pisiforme and does not pass through the carpal tunnel!

> [!NOTE] Carpal tunnel syndrome
> If the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel, it can lead to sensory losses and pain in the first 3½ fingers. The muscles of the hand innervated by the median nerve can also atrophy. The pressure on the nerve can be reduced through a surgical division of the flexor retinaculum.

### Guyon-Loge (Ulnar canal)

- Definition: The Guyon canal is an osteofibrous canal ulnar (and ventral) to the carpal canal, which carries the A. and V. ulnaris as well as the N. ulnaris from the forearm to the hollow hand.
- Limitations
    - Palmar: Palmar carpal ligament
    - Dorsal: Flexor retinaculum and Lig. pisohamatum
    - Radial: Hamulus of the hamate bone
    - Ulnar: Pisiform bone
- Structures in the Guyon Lodge
    - A. ulnaris with accompanying veins
    - Ulnar nerve

> [!NOTE]
> In the palm of the Guyon canal only the M. palmaris longus and the palmar branches of the N. medianus and N. ulnaris run!

### Radial foveola (Tabatière)

- Definition: Hollow that forms on the proximal, radial back of the hand during thumb extension and abduction.
- Limitations
    - Radial: M. extensor pollicis brevis, M. abductor pollicis longus
    - Ulnar: M. extensor pollicis longus
- Meaning: In the anatomical snuffbox, the radial artery can be palpated on the scaphoid bone.
## Review Questions for the Chapter Hand
### Bone

What is the special feature of the pisiform bone among the carpal bones?
- The os pisiforme is part of the proximal carpal bones and functions as a hypomochlion (sesamoid bone) of the M. flexor carpi ulnaris. This increases its lever function and reduces the required force.

### Joints

Which structures form the proximal wrist? What is its function?
- The proximal wrist primarily serves palmar flexion and is formed by the distal radius and distal ulna (indirectly via an articular disc) with the proximal row of carpal bones (except for the os pisiforme).
Which joint is formed by the trapezium bone and the first metacarpal bone? What is its function?
- The os trapezium and os metacarpale I form the thumb saddle joint (articulatio carpometacarpalis pollicis). As a saddle joint, it enables the high mobility of the thumb and thus its opposition for grasping objects.

### Muscles

Which nerve innervates the M. abductor pollicis brevis?
- The M. abductor pollicis brevis, like the M. opponens pollicis, is innervated by the N. medianus.
Where are the origin and insertion of the Mm. lumbricales? What function do they perform?
- The Mm. lumbricales originate from the tendon of the M. flexor digitalis profundus and twist from palmar to lateral to the dorsal aponeuroses of fingers II–V. This twisted course explains why they flex at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extend at the interphalangeal joints.
Which nerve supplies the hypothenar muscles? Where does it originate?
- The N. ulnaris supplies the hypothenar muscles. It originates from the fasciculus medialis in C8–Th1.

### Fascia and tendon sheaths

Which muscles pass through the total of six tendon compartments of the extensors?
- The N. ulnaris supplies the hypothenar muscles. It originates from the fasciculus medialis in C8–Th1.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

Which structure runs together with the deep palmar arch of the radial artery and ulnar artery?
- The motor ramus profundus of the N. ulnaris usually runs with the arterial anastomosis arch, the arcus palmaris profundus.

### Topography

Which structures pass through the carpal tunnel?
- Besides the N. medianus, the muscle tendons of M. flexor pollicis longus as well as M. flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus pass through the carpal tunnel.
Where is the Guyon canal? Which anatomical structures border it and which structures pass through it?
- The Guyon’s canal, also called the canalis ulnaris, is located ventral to the carpal tunnel and carries arteries, veins, and the N. ulnaris from the forearm to the palm. It is bordered palmar by the ligamentum carpi palmare, dorsal by the flexor retinaculum, radial by the hamulus ossis hamati, and ulnar by the os pisiforme.
