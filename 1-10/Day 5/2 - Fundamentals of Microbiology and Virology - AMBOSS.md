# Fundamentals of Microbiology and Virology
## Summary

Microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. As carriers of a variety of sometimes life-threatening infectious diseases, knowledge about the structure, lifestyles, infection mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches of these microorganisms is of particular relevance. Here, there is an overview of the fundamentals of microbiological ecology, viruses, and fungi. Bacteria represent a rather extensive topic and will be addressed separately under "Bacteria."

## Fundamentals of Microbiological Ecology and Infections

The ecology deals with the interplay between living beings and the environment, as well as among the living beings themselves. Infectiology is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the course and effects of diseases caused by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, parasites, viruses, and prions).

### Cell Types

- Prokaryotic cells: Unicellular organisms without a nucleus
    - Occurrences: Bacteria, Blue-green algae
- Eukaryotic cells: Mostly multicellular and possessing a nucleus, chromosomes, etc.
    - Occurrences: Animals, Plants, Fungi

### Energy Cycle within an Ecosystem

- Ecosystem: Community of all microorganisms and abiotic factors of a biotope
- Energy cycle between the various elements of the ecosystem
    - Producers: Plants produce organic compounds using solar energy.
    - Primary consumers: Consumers of plants and their products ("plant eaters," herbivores)
    - Secondary consumers: Feed on primary consumers ("meat eaters", carnivores)
    - Decomposers: Convert organic substances back into inorganic substances.
        - Bacteria and fungi utilize waste products from all producers and consumers.
        - Inorganic substances are once again available to producers.
- Food chain
    - Hierarchy of the aforementioned parts of the energy cycle (Plant producer → Herbivore → Carnivore → Decomposer)
    - Introduced pollutants are passed on to the next links in the food chain.


> [!note] Mercury poisoning
> Through the discharge of industrial wastewater, mercury can enter rivers and seas. In fish, it accumulates as methylmercury. Frequent consumption of fish poisoned with methylmercury can lead to chronic mercury poisoning in humans, which is manifested, among other things, by damage to the central nervous system and the kidneys. In this case, mercury has not reached humans directly, but rather through the food chain.

### Interrelationships between different species of organisms

- Symbiosis: The coexistence of two species to mutual benefit
    - Example: Döderlein bacteria of the vaginal flora convert the glycogen of the sloughed vaginal cells into lactic acid.
        - Benefit for the Döderlein bacteria: Obtaining energy from glycogen
        - Benefits for the human body:
            - Maintaining an acidic environment
            - Protection against miscolonization by pathogenic germs that cannot survive in an acidic environment.
- Commensalism: The use of a host organism without benefit or harm to it.
    - Examples:
        - Colonization of the skin by numerous germs that feed on shed cells but provide no particular benefit to humans.
        - Lions leave food scraps for vultures, which consume them
- Parasitism: Utilizing a host organism while simultaneously causing harm to it
    - Parasites are eukaryotes that depend on one or more hosts during their life cycle.
    - Example: Malaria plasmodia are transmitted to humans (intermediate host) by the female Anopheles mosquito during blood feeding, causing malaria illness (fever attacks, potentially fatal course).

### Infection and Pathogenicity

The interaction between microorganisms and humans can vary.

- Colonization: Settlement of skin and mucous membranes with microorganisms without clinical symptoms or invasion of the body.
    - This "natural flora" is present in every individual, but its composition is unique.
        - While pathogenic agents can be found here to some extent, the microorganisms of the "natural flora" inhibit their growth and thus the infection of the organism.
- Invasion: Active penetration into tissues and cells
- Infection: The invasion and multiplication of pathogenic agents in a host organism, which typically triggers a defense reaction and/or damage with signs of inflammation.
    - Facultative pathogenic microorganisms: Only cause an infection under certain conditions (such as an immune deficiency or in specific organs).
    - Obligate pathogenic germs: They can also infect an immunocompetent host and regularly lead to an infection.
- Opportunistic Infection
- Nosocomial infection: Infection that is temporally related to a hospital stay or an outpatient/inpatient medical procedure (e.g., also nursing facilities, nursing homes).
- Zoonosis
- Virulence: Degree of pathogenicity

### Course of Infections

Depending on how widespread an infection is in the population, one refers to an endemic, epidemic, and/or pandemic. Infectious diseases typically show a heterogeneous, yet typical course.

1. Contact with a pathogen in sufficient quantity (so-called infectious dose)
    - The intake usually occurs through natural body openings (e.g. via respiratory tract or fecal-oral).
2. After the incubation period, the disease occurs.
3. The disease can heal, persist, or lead to death.
4. If the disease is completely eliminated, lifelong immunity is possible with certain pathogens (e.g. mumps or rubella).

### Hand Disinfection

- Hygienic hand disinfection
    - Goal: Reduction of the microbial count of the transient skin flora
    - Indication
        - Before and after each patient contact
        - Before aseptic procedures (e.g. establishing an intravenous access)
        - After contact with the patient's bodily fluids
        - After contact with the patient's surroundings
    - Substances: Alcohol and phenol mixtures
    - Implementation
        - Apply sufficient disinfectant to dry (!) skin
        - Wetting of the inner and outer surfaces of the hands as well as the fingertips, thumb, and spaces between the fingers
        - Duration: Min. 30 seconds
- Surgical hand disinfection
    - Goal: Elimination of transient and maximum reduction of resident skin flora
    - Indication: Before any surgical procedure
    - Substances: Alcohol and phenol mixtures
    - Implementation (Differences from hygienic hand disinfection)
        - In addition to the hands, the forearm area must also be completely included in surgical hand disinfection.
        - Disinfection usually starts with wetting the hands and is continued to the forearms.
        - Duration: Min. 3 minutes

## Viruses

Viruses consist only of a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), lack the equipment for metabolism, replication, and protein biosynthesis, and are therefore dependent on host cells: They infect these cells, reproduce using their resources, and are subsequently released, destroying the host cell in the process. Thus, they are classified as parasites.

### Concept of Virus

- Obligate parasites: Completely dependent on a host cell for replication and protein biosynthesis.
- Possible host cells
    - Eukaryotic cells, e.g. from
        - People
        - Animals
        - Plants: Infection by so-called "Viroids"
            - Viroid: Small RNA molecules
                - Circular RNA
                - No capsid
                - No viral envelope
    - Prokaryotic cells: Viruses that specifically infect bacteria are called "bacteriophages."
- Virion: Extracellular (i.e., present outside a host cell) viral particle, which is usually infectious.

> [!note]
> Viruses are parasites that require host cells for reproduction!

### Structure of Viruses

- Nucleic acid: Contains the genetic information of the virus in various possible forms
    - Single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds)
    - DNA or RNA
- Capsid: The protein shell surrounding the viral nucleic acid
- Nucleocapsid: Nucleic acid and capsid of a virus
- Virus envelope
    - Structure composed of lipids and glycoproteins (e.g., hemagglutinin as the surface glycoprotein of the influenza virus)
    - Not present in all viruses: Distinguishing feature between enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza virus, HIV) and naked viruses (e.g., adenovirus, human papillomavirus)
- Criteria for the classification of viruses
    - DNA or RNA
    - Single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) genome
    - Uncovered or covered
    - Shape of the capsid: Icosahedral or helical
    - Sensitivity to chemical or physical influences

> [!note]
> A virus contains either DNA or RNA!

### Viral Life Cycle

The multiplication cycle of bacteriophages differs from that of viruses infecting eukaryotic cells. Here, only the multiplication cycle of the latter will be discussed. After infection, viruses enter their respective host organ; there, they undergo a long replication cycle, at the end of which the assembly of the individual components takes place.

1. Attachment (Adsorption) to the host cell: Infection with viruses depends on surface characteristics of the host cells (e.g., the HIV virus infects all cells with CD4 surface markers).
2. Penetration into the host cell
    - For non-enveloped viruses through endocytosis or transmembrane transport
    - Enveloped viruses either fuse with the envelope of the potential host cell or also enter through endocytosis.
3. Release (Uncoating) of the nucleic acid
4. Replication of nucleic acids and formation of virus proteins and cleavage of precursor proteins by viral proteases.
5. Assembly of the virus components following translation and transcription.
6. Release of viruses: For enveloped viruses through budding, for non-enveloped viruses via host cell lysis.
    - The period between uncoating in the host cell and the production of detectable virus particles is called "eclipse."

#### Translation and replication of the viral genome

- DNA viruses: Direct integration of the viral DNA into the DNA of the host cell, followed by transcription and translation using the resources of the host cell.
- RNA viruses: Depending on the polarity of the viral RNA, direct translation into polypeptides or transcription into an mRNA by their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
    - RNA-dependent RNA polymerases require ribonucleotides as substrates.
    - Special case retroviruses
        - Single-stranded RNA contains genetic information.
        - Reverse transcriptase transcribes RNA into a double-stranded so-called "proviral DNA" (reverse transcriptase is a DNA polymerase that can use both RNA and DNA as a template)
        - Contain viral oncogenes (see below)
        - Important representative: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

> [!note]
> Retroviruses derive their name from their characteristic components: reverse transcriptase and oncogenes!

#### Tumor development caused by viruses

Both DNA and RNA viruses can contribute to tumor development. They differ in the mechanisms involved.

- Oncogenic DNA viruses: Alter the DNA of the host cell, so that proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and the regulatory genes of apoptosis can no longer be read properly → Inactivation of the host's own cell cycle regulation
    - Human Papillomavirus (HPV): Cervical, Vulvar, Vaginal cancer
    - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinomas
    - Hepatitis B Virus (HBV): Hepatocellular Carcinoma
    - Cytomegalovirus (Human Herpesvirus 5=HHV-5, CMV) and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection → Kaposi's sarcoma
- Oncogenic RNA viruses: Possess viral oncogenes that code for the synthesis of transformation-active proteins.
    - Human T-lymphotropic Virus (HTLV 1): T-cell lymphoma
    - Hepatitis C Virus (HCV): Hepatocellular Carcinoma

#### Genetic variability using the example of the influenza virus

The viral genome is varied through different mechanisms. By altering the viral antigens or even the virus subtypes, the spread of the viruses is supported, as there are still no defense mechanisms against this form.

- Antigen drift: Slight change in the antigen structure (hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase) due to point mutations.
    - The designation of the subtype does not change as a result (e.g. H5N1 "avian influenza" remains H5N1)
- Antigen shift
    - In a co-infection of two influenza subtypes, new influenza subtypes can arise through the exchange of entire gene segments (reassortment) between viruses (e.g., H3N1 → H2N1)
    - This process is facilitated by the contact of human pathogenic and xenogenic influenza viruses.

### Transmission Paths

Human pathogenic viruses can be transmitted in various ways. The main routes of transmission are illustrated here.

- Oral
- Fecal-Oral
- Blood
- Semen/Vaginal secretions
- Droplet infection
- Vectors

> [!note]
> The most common mode of transmission for HIV in Germany is unprotected sexual intercourse!

### Therapy and Prevention

The infection of a cell by a virus or the integration of the viral genome into that of the cell is irreversible. Therapeutic approaches consist of preventing the further multiplication of viruses through so-called virostatics or in the prevention of an infection (e.g., through vaccinations, disinfectants).

> [!note] Virostatics
> Antiviral drugs inhibit the spread of viruses by interrupting the viral replication cycle at various points. Since the peak of viral replication is usually reached with the onset of clinical symptoms, rapid diagnostics must be performed to allow for the timely use of antiviral drugs.

#### Classification of the Areas of Action of Disinfectants according to the Robert Koch Institute

- "Limited virucidal": Effective only against enveloped viruses
- "Limited Virucidal PLUS": Effective against enveloped and certain non-enveloped viruses such as adenoviruses, noroviruses, or rotaviruses.
- "Virucidal": Effective against enveloped and non-enveloped viruses
## Fungi

### Overview

- Fungi: Eukaryotic organisms that can exist as unicellular or multicellular.
- Heterotrophic nutrition: That is, the necessity of organic substances as energy sources.
- Mycoses: Infections diseases caused by fungi
    - In immunocompetent patients: Often only local infections
    - In immunosuppressed patients (e.g., HIV patients or patients after bone marrow transplantation): involvement of internal organs and the system
- Three types of human pathogenic fungi
    - Dermatophytes (thread fungi): Primarily affect skin, hair, and nails.
    - Hepafens (sprouting fungi): Infestation of skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs possible
    - Molds: Form macroscopically visible "mold" on food and can lead to allergies in the body, among other things.

> [!note]
> Mushrooms do not belong to plants. They cannot perform photosynthesis!

### Structure and Characteristics of Fungi

There are many characteristics for differentiating fungi; however, most derive from the four fundamental elements listed here.

- Especially dermatophytes and molds
    - Hyphe: Multicellular association of fungal cells that are interconnected by pore-containing septa.
    - Mycel: Mycelium, a network that arises through asexual reproduction
- Especially yeasts
    - Budding cells: Daughter cells formed by budding in unicellular fungi
    - Pseudomycel: Chains of budding cells that are elongated in a hyphal manner but are separated by complete septa.

### Multiplication

Fungi can reproduce both sexually and asexually.

- Asexual (= unisexual) reproduction
    - Spore formation: Permanent forms of fungi that primarily serve their distribution
    - Sprouting: "Severing" of daughter cells
    - Decay of hyphens
- Sexual reproduction: The fusion of two cells results in the formation of a diploid zygote.

### Characteristics of the Mushroom Cell

- Cell wall: Usually consists of chitin, rarely of cellulose.
- Cell membrane: Contains the plant steroid ergosterol

> [!note] Azole Antifungals
> The ergosterol synthesis of the cell membrane of fungi can be used as a target for therapy with antifungals. Azole antifungals achieve their effect by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, thus having a broad spectrum of activity in the treatment of mycoses.

### Substances Synthesized from Fungi

Various substances are produced by fungi that have clinical significance for humans:

- Antibiotics: Are partially synthesized by certain fungi
    - E.g. Penicillin
        - Formation by Penicillium notatum
        - Bactericidal effect primarily against gram-positive pathogens
- Toxin
    - Aflatoxin
        - Formation caused by mold fungi, which are often found on nuts, grain products, etc. (e.g. Aspergillus flavus)
        - Carcinogenic effect
    - Amanitin and Phalloidin
        - Gifts of the death cap mushroom
            - Amanitin: Inhibition of transcription and protein biosynthesis → In the course of organ damage, primarily of the liver and kidneys.
            - Phalloidin: Irreversible binding to F-actin → Inhibition of cellular transport processes
        - Consuming a single mushroom can already be fatal.
    - Ergotamine (ergot alkaloid)
        - Education through the ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea) on grains and grasses
        - Binding to α-adrenoceptors of the sympathetic nervous system → Vasoconstriction

> [!note] Death cap mushroom poisoning
> A poisoning with amanitin, the toxin from the death cap mushroom, leads to gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea after about 12 hours. In the course of the illness, toxic failure of the liver and kidneys may occur. If the poisoning is recognized in time, the absorption of the toxin should be prevented through gastric lavage and/or the administration of activated charcoal. The antidote silibinin can intercept the effects. However, up to 15% of those affected may die.

> [!note] Ergot poisoning
> A poisoning with the toxin of the ergot fungus (ergotamine) leads to symptoms such as headaches and nausea, as well as other symptoms that can be explained by the stimulating effect of ergotamine on α-adrenergic receptors. The induced vasoconstriction can lead to numbness and even the death of arms and legs. In pregnant women, contractions of the uterus can result in miscarriages. In the Middle Ages, ergotamine was used for this reason as an abortifacient.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Fundamentals of Microbiology and Virology

### Fundamentals of Microbiological Ecology and Infections

The frequent consumption of fish is associated with the risk of poisoning from which heavy metal and why?
- Frequent consumption of fish, especially large predatory fish, can lead to chronic mercury poisoning in humans. Mercury enters rivers and seas through the discharge of industrial wastewater and is absorbed by fish. In the fish, it accumulates as highly toxic methylmercury, which eventually reaches humans through the food chain.

Define symbiosis and give an example in the human body!
- Symbiosis refers to a mutualistic relationship between different species of organisms. The human body, for example, forms a symbiosis with Döderlein bacteria in the vaginal flora.

Define parasitism! Which parasitic tropical disease is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles?
- Parasitism refers to a relationship between different species of organisms, where the benefit is one-sided on the part of the parasite and the host organism is even harmed. Malaria is a parasitic tropical disease that is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito.

### Viruses

Describe the general structure of viruses and the specific structure of the influenza virus!
- Viruses consist essentially of a nucleocapsid: a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein shell (= capsid). Some viruses are also surrounded by a viral envelope made of lipids and glycoproteins. There are no structures for metabolism, replication, and protein biosynthesis, which is why viruses are always dependent on a host cell. The influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus.

What does reassortment of viral gene segments mean and what are its consequences? Which virus is known for its frequent reassortment?
- If a host cell is simultaneously infected by two similar viruses, they can exchange and rearrange genomic segments – this is called reassortment. The resulting emergence of completely new virus variants is referred to as antigenic shift. Antigenic shifts are particularly known for influenza viruses, which can transition into new subtypes (e.g., H3N1 → H2N1) and, in the worst cases, can trigger severe pandemics.

To which virus species does the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) belong? What is the special feature of this species regarding its replication cycle, and how does this serve as a target for drug therapy?
- The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the most important representative of retroviruses. This virus species contains its genetic information in the form of single-stranded RNA; however, it is first transcribed into double-stranded so-called proviral DNA using reverse transcriptase and then integrated into the host cell's genome. Medications that inhibit reverse transcriptase (e.g., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like tenofovir) can thereby prevent DNA integration and virus replication.

How do DNA viruses reproduce in their host cells?
- DNA viruses integrate their genome directly into the DNA in the nucleus of the host cell after release. The transcription and translation of the viral DNA then occur via the host cell's organelles.
### Mushrooms

What are aflatoxins?
- Aflatoxins are toxins produced by mold (e.g., Aspergillus flavus). With repeated exposure, they are carcinogenic and can promote the development of liver carcinomas.

What are the effects of poisoning from the ergot fungus?
- The toxic effect of the ergot fungus is mediated by its toxin ergot alkaloid (= ergotamine). It stimulates α-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system and causes, in addition to headaches and nausea, vasoconstriction, which can lead to numbness and even necrosis of the arms and legs.
