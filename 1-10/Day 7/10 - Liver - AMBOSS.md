# Liver
## Summary

The liver is the largest gland and the central metabolic organ of the human body. It lies directly beneath the diaphragm, mostly in the right upper abdomen, but extends to the left over the stomach. Anatomically, it is divided into four liver lobes; however, its functional division into eight liver segments is clinically much more relevant. Histologically, the liver is composed of structural elements of about 1-2 mm in diameter - the liver lobules. Between three liver lobules, there is a periportal field in which the vessels of the portal triad run.

Through the portal vein, the liver receives nutrients that have been absorbed from the intestine by enterocytes and released into the bloodstream. A large portion of these nutrients is either broken down for energy in the liver or used for the synthesis of substances that the body needs. Furthermore, the liver stores various nutrients, such as glucose in the form of glycogen, fat-soluble vitamins, and the trace elements copper and iron. The liver plays a particularly important role in glucose metabolism. Through various mechanisms, it ensures that blood sugar levels are kept constant within narrow limits (for example, with the help of gluconeogenesis, which only the liver and the kidneys are capable of).

Another important function of the liver is detoxification: In the context of biotransformation, non-polar, lipophilic substances are coupled with hydrophilic substances, making them water-soluble. This allows for better excretion. The breakdown products of foreign substances, as well as those produced by the body, are partially secreted into the duodenum via the biliary system. The liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder are often clinically referred to together as the "hepatic-biliary system" due to their anatomical and functional proximity.

The development of the liver begins as early as the end of the 2nd week of pregnancy and is roughly divided into two steps: the development of the parenchyma and the development of the intrahepatic vascular system. A special feature of the fetal liver is its ability for hematopoiesis, which it loses after birth.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile of the Liver

- Function: Central organ of intermediate metabolism
- Shape: Wedge-shaped
- Size: approx. 20 cm long, approx. 15 cm high, and approx. 10 cm wide
- Weight: approx. 1,800 g (♂) / 1,600 g (♀)
- Location: In the right upper abdomen, predominantly intraperitoneal

### Structure of the Liver

#### Areas of the Liver

The liver is centrally located in the right upper abdomen between the diaphragm and the abdominal organs. With the exception of the area nuda, it is completely covered by the peritoneum. The sharp lower liver edge (margo inferior) and the rounded upper liver edge (margo superior) divide the liver into two surfaces.

- Visceral surface of the liver: Concave and facing the abdominal organs
- Diaphragmatic surface of the liver: Convexly rounded and facing the diaphragm
- Naked area
    - Area around the inferior vena cava that is not covered by peritoneum
    - Is bounded by the ligamentum coronarium of the liver.

#### Morphological Structure of the Liver

The connective tissue septa from the fibrous tunic surrounding the liver ("Glisson capsule") extend inward and divide the liver into four lobes. Between the caudate lobe and the quadrate lobe lies the hepatic portal (Porta hepatis).

- Liver lobe
    - Left lobe of the liver
    - Right lobe of the liver
    - Caudate nucleus
    - Quadrate lobe
- Porta hepatis (Hepatic portal): Transverse fissure between the caudate lobe (dorsal, adjacent to the inferior vena cava) and the quadrate lobe (ventral, adjacent to the gallbladder). Here, the vessels of the portal triad enter or exit the liver.
    - Portal triad: Consists of the bile duct (common hepatic duct), hepatic portal vein, and proper hepatic artery.

> [!NOTE]
> The division into four lobes is purely morphological and has no functional relevance!

#### Functional Structure

The functional structure of the liver is closely associated with its blood supply and allows for a division into eight segments.

- Liver segments: Functional subunits of the liver, each supplied by a branch of the portal triad.
    - Numbering: The caudate lobe is segment I. From there, the segments are numbered in a clockwise direction and from dorsal to ventral.

> [!NOTE]
> The functional division of the liver is based on the branches of the portal vein and is therefore not congruent with the anatomical classification. The left part is formed by segments I–IV and the right by segments V–VIII, with segment I (= caudate lobe) often considered separately. Segment IV corresponds to the quadrate lobe.

> [!NOTE] Liver partial resection (liver surgery)
> The division of the liver into segments is of clinical relevance. Due to their respective supply through the portal triad, individual segments can be surgically resected if they are, for example, affected by a tumor.

#### Bands of the Liver

The liver is fixed by several ligaments to various structures of the abdominal cavity and abdominal wall. Some of the ligaments are remnants of obliterated embryonic liver vessels.

|Band|Location and Function|Connection with|
|---|---|---|
|Right and left triangular ligaments (Triangular ligaments)|- Union of the two leaves of the left and right coronarium ligament of the bare area|- Diaphragm|
|Coronary ligament|- Transition from parietal to visceral peritoneum<br>- Limitation of the area nuda<br>- Also the fold of the triangular ligaments|- Diaphragm|
|Falciform ligament of the liver|- Peritoneal fold (formed from the anterior part of the ventral mesogastrium)<br>- Macrospically separates the right and left lobes of the liver at the diaphragmatic surface<br>- Extends from the coronary ligament ventrally|- Ventral abdominal wall|
|Lig. teres hepatis|- Separates the left lobe of the liver and the quadrate lobe macroscopically<br>- Corresponds to the obliterated remnant of the umbilical vein|- Navel|
|Lig. venosum|- Macrospically separates the left lobe of the liver and the caudate lobe<br>- Corresponds to the obliterated ductus venosus|- Umbilical vein<br>- Inferior vena cava|
|Hepatogastric ligament|- Part of the lesser omentum|- Stomach|
|Hepatoduodenal ligament|- Part of the lesser omentum<br>- Contains the hepatic portal vein, proper hepatic artery, common bile duct|- Duodenum|

> [!NOTE]
> The division into the left and right lobes of the liver can be observed macroscopically through the falciform ligament of the liver or functionally through the venous blood flow!

### Topography of the Liver

Due to its central location in the upper abdomen, the liver has positional relationships with many abdominal organs. Because it has a soft consistency, the neighboring organs leave indentations (impressions) on the liver's surface.

|Liver lobe|Spatial relationship|Impression on the liver surface|
|---|---|---|
|Right lobe of the liver|- Colon (Right colic flexure)|- Colic impression|
|- Duodenum (Superior part)|- Duodenal impression|
|- Right kidney (upper pole)|- Renal impression|
|- Right adrenal gland|- Adrenal impression|
|Lobe of the left liver|- Stomach (especially the fundus of the stomach)|- Gastric impression|
|- Esophagus (Cardiac Vestibule)|- Esophageal Impression|

> [!NOTE] Palpation of the liver
> The liver is normally well protected under the rib cage and can best be palpated there during inspiration due to its respiratory mobility: The examiner places the fingertips of both hands under the right rib cage; the right upper abdomen is slightly pressed in with the fingers. The patient is asked to take a deep breath while maintaining the pressure. Due to diaphragm excursion, the attached liver is now shifted caudally and its lower edge contacts the palpating fingers. In this way, conclusions can be drawn about the surface texture, consistency, and size of the liver.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Liver

#### Vascular Supply

The blood supply to the liver differs from that of other organs. In addition to the arteriovenous circulation (Vasa privata, serving its own supply), it is part of the so-called portal circulation (Vasa publica, serving the entire body).

- Private vessel
    - A. hepatica propria → A. hepatic right/left → Interlobular arteries → Sinusoid
    - Venous drainage: Blood from sinusoids → Central veins (Vv. centrales) → Sublobular veins (Vv. sublobulares) → Right/left/intermediate hepatic vein (V. hepatica dextra/sinistra/intermedia) → Inferior vena cava (V. cava inferior)
- Public vessel
    - V. portae hepatis ("portal vein")
        - Branches together with the A. hepatica propria (and the bile ducts) into the sinusoids
        - Collects the nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor blood from the unpaired abdominal organs.
    - Venous drainage: Corresponds to that of the vasa privata

> [!NOTE] Portal Hypertension
> The pressure in the portal vein is usually 3–6 mmHg. Due to various causes (mostly liver cirrhosis), there can be an increase in flow resistance in the hepatic circulation and thus an increased pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). As a result, the normal blood flow through the liver is no longer guaranteed. The blood seeks an alternative route through the so-called portocaval anastomoses, which can lead to a variety of complications such as esophageal varices, anorectal varices, and ascites.

#### Innervation

- Vegetative Innervation
    - Sympathetic (from the celiac ganglion): Inhibits bile flow and promotes glycogen breakdown
    - Parasympathetic (from the vagus nerve): Increases bile flow and promotes glycogen synthesis
- Sensible Innervation (via the right phrenic nerve): Peritoneal covering and Glisson's capsule

> [!NOTE]
> The liver is the only intraperitoneal organ whose visceral peritoneum is sensitively innervated!

## Microscopic Anatomy

Histologically, the liver is made up of structural elements about 1-2mm in diameter - the liver lobules. Between three liver lobules, there is a periportal field where the vessels of the portal triad run. From here, the blood-filled sinusoids radiate towards the central vein, which is located at the center of each lobule. The lobules are therefore also referred to as central venous lobules.

### Microscopic Structure

In addition to the purely anatomical division into central venous lobules, the liver can also be functionally divided into liver acini and portal venous lobules.

- Important Definitions
    - Central vein: The smallest branch of the hepatic veins, that is, the draining blood vessels. Here, the blood collects and is then directed to the inferior vena cava through the hepatic veins.
    - Periportal field: Triangular connective tissue structure. Here run the vessels of the Glisson triad.
    - Glisson's Triad: The vessels of the portal triad at the level of the hepatic veins
        - Interlobular bile ducts
            - Histology: Lined by a single layer of isoprismatic epithelium with prominent round cell nuclei; usually has the smallest lumen of the structures of the Glisson triad.
        - A. interlobularis
            - Histology: Round and relatively narrow lumen containing erythrocytes; thicker tunica media
        - V. interlobularis
            - Histology: Rather oval to irregular lumen (always larger than that of the artery), containing erythrocytes.

> [!NOTE]
> Flow direction of blood from the portal vein and the proper hepatic artery: Periportal field → Central vein; Flow direction of bile: Central vein → Periportal field!

### The Liver Sinusoids

The liver sinusoids are wider than ordinary capillaries; they contain mixed blood from the hepatic portal vein and the proper hepatic artery and drain into the central veins. The wall of the sinusoids is lined with discontinuous endothelium.

- Endothelial cells
    - Flat cells that line the sinusoids
    - Between the individual endothelial cells are large pores (= discontinuous endothelium)
- Disse space (perisinusoidal space): Gap between endothelial cells and hepatocytes that, among other things, absorbs substances produced by hepatocytes.

> [!NOTE]
> In the Disse space, there are many Ito cells and extensions of Kupffer cells!

### Liver Cells

In addition to the hepatocytes, which make up the largest proportion of liver cells, the space of Disse contains Ito cells and extensions of Kupffer cells.

- Hepatocytes: Specialized epithelial cells that are abundantly equipped with all cell organelles due to their diverse metabolic tasks (e.g., cholesterol biosynthesis, urea cycle, synthesis of serum proteins, biotransformation)
    - Polar construction and functionality
        - Blood pole (the basolateral pole): Directly borders the Disse space
            - Function: Uptake of substances from the blood and release of synthesis products via specific carriers
        - Gall pole (the apical pole): Borders on the bile canaliculi
            - Function: Secretion of bile
        - Zytosol: Contains glycogen, many mitochondria, pronounced endoplasmic reticulum
- Kupffer cells: Liver-specific macrophages that are adjacent to the endothelial cells.
    - Function: Removal of foreign particles, bacteria, and damaged, old blood cells through phagocytosis.
- Ito cells (syn.: stellate cells, perisinusoidal cells): Individual cells in the Disse space that contain large lipid droplets.
    - Function
        - Store the Vitamin A absorbed in the intestine in lipid droplets.
        - Produce the intralobular connective tissue

> [!NOTE] Liver cirrhosis
> Liver cirrhosis is the end stage of most untreated liver diseases. It involves the destruction and fibrosis of liver tissue. The Ito cells are significantly responsible for the increased connective tissue formation, which leads to the nodular-scarring transformation of the liver in the context of liver cirrhosis. Consequences of fibrosis include a markedly impaired liver function and blood flow, which can lead to portal hypertension. Furthermore, there is a closure of the pores in the discontinuous endothelium, which complicates the exchange of substances and is referred to as "capillarization of the sinusoidal endothelium."

> [!NOTE] Hepatic steatosis
> Through overeating, alcohol abuse, or hereditary metabolic diseases, a disturbance in the liver's fat metabolism can occur, leading to the accumulation of fat vacuoles in the hepatocytes. This is referred to as fatty liver (steatosis hepatis). The fatty liver is reversible and initially hardly noticeable, but it can progress to fatty liver inflammation (steatohepatitis) or liver cirrhosis.

## Overview of the Functions of the Liver

The liver plays a crucial role in intermediate metabolism. Intermediate metabolism includes the metabolic pathways that occur at the intersection of catabolism and anabolism. The functions of the liver can be categorized as follows.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Energy Metabolism|- Breakdown of Carbohydrates (Glycolysis)<br>- Breakdown of Fatty Acids (β-Oxidation)<br>- Proteolysis and Amino Acid Degradation|
|Synthesis function|- Gluconeogenesis<br>- Ketone body synthesis<br>- Synthesis of many plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, globulins, acute-phase proteins, coagulation factors)<br>- Cholesterol biosynthesis<br>- Synthesis of bile acids<br>- Fatty acid synthesis|
|Regulatory Function|- Glucose Homeostasis: The liver is the key organ in regulating blood sugar levels. The following mechanisms are available to it:<br>    - Raising blood sugar levels<br>        - Glycogenolysis<br>        - Gluconeogenesis<br>        - Breakdown of insulin<br>    - Lowering blood sugar levels<br>        - Glycogen synthesis<br>        - Glycolysis<br>- Acid-Base Balance (see "The Role of the Liver in pH Regulation")|
|Storage function|- Glucose in the form of glycogen<br>- Lipids in the form of lipoproteins<br>- Vitamins (A, B12, E, D, K, folic acid)<br>- Trace elements (copper, iron)|
|Detoxification and Excretion Function|- Breakdown of damaged erythrocytes<br>- Urea cycle<br>- Biotransformation|

## Biotransformation

The biotransformation serves to convert apolar, lipophilic substances into polar, water-soluble substances that can then be excreted with urine or bile. Substrates of biotransformation can be both endogenous substances, known as endobiotics (e.g., bilirubin, steroid hormones), as well as exogenous substances, known as xenobiotics (pharmaceuticals, environmental toxins, preservatives).

### Location and Procedure

#### Place

- Mainly in the liver (in the smooth ER)

#### Procedure

The biotransformation occurs in three phases.

- Modification
- Conjugation
- Elimination

##### Phase 1: Modification

First, the relevant connections are transformed through oxidative reactions (rarely also reductive or hydrolytic processes) so that reactive groups are formed.

- Oxidative Modifications
    - Oxidation by monooxygenases
        - The monooxygenases belong to the group of cytochrome P450 enzymes.
            - For example, MEOS (Microsomal Ethanol-Oxidizing System), which is induced by persistently high blood alcohol concentrations and breaks down ethanol into acetaldehyde.
        - They hydroxylate their substrate by incorporating an oxygen atom from O2.
        - The second oxygen atom from O2 is reduced to water by means of the cosubstrate NADPH+H+.
    - Oxidation by dehydrogenases
        - Example of ethanol degradation:
            1. Oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) with the consumption of NAD+
            2. Oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), also consuming NAD+.
            3. Ligation of acetate and coenzyme A to acetyl-CoA by thiokinase with ATP consumption

> [!NOTE]
> Calculation of blood alcohol content using the Widmark formula
> The Widmark formula is used to estimate blood alcohol levels: Blood alcohol (promille, ‰) = Amount of alcohol (grams) / (Body weight (kg) × Reduction factor). Alcohol breakdown by alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver occurs linearly. Taking into account the alcohol breakdown over time and the absorption deficit, the following modified formula is derived: Blood alcohol (promille, ‰) = Amount of alcohol (grams) × (1 - Absorption deficit) / (Body weight × Reduction factor) − Elimination rate × Number of hours (h) since drinking began.

> [!NOTE] Alcohol intolerance
> An alcohol intolerance can have various causes, often genetic in nature. Many people of East Asian descent possess a defective variant of aldehyde dehydrogenase. While ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde (ethanal), the oxidation and thus the breakdown of the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde are inhibited. This causes symptoms such as headaches, nausea, flushing, and tachycardia; in some cases, this can lead to life-threatening poisoning symptoms. However, even in healthy individuals, acetaldehyde is particularly responsible for the symptoms of a "hangover" after alcohol consumption.

> [!NOTE] Alcohol dependence
> The diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence include dependency characteristics such as tolerance development and withdrawal symptoms. Depending on the stage of the disease, both general physical as well as psychological and neurological symptoms may occur. Consequential diseases of alcohol dependence are numerous and common; among the most frequent is liver cirrhosis. The toxic effect of acetaldehyde produced during ethanol metabolism lies, among other things, in its ability to form covalent adducts (= composite molecules) with proteins, lipids, and DNA. This impairs enzyme functions and gene expression and causes DNA damage. As a result, acetaldehyde can significantly contribute to the development of liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.

> [!NOTE] Methanol intoxication
> In the improper production of drinking alcohol, methanol can be formed, which is oxidized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde. The aldehyde dehydrogenase then converts this into formic acid. This leads to a metabolic acidosis that can cause nausea and disturbances of consciousness. Typically, visual disturbances/blindness also occur in methanol intoxication. For treatment, ethanol is administered, as alcohol dehydrogenase has a higher affinity for ethanol compared to methanol and preferentially breaks it down. Methanol itself is then exhaled or removed via hemodialysis.

##### Phase 2: Conjugation

- Connection of the reactive groups formed in phase 1 with strongly polar molecules, so that water-soluble conjugates are formed.
- Typical coupling substances
    - Glucuronic acid
    - Acetyl-CoA
    - Amino acids
    - Glutathione

##### Phase 3: Elimination

- Transport of the generated water-soluble compounds across the plasma membrane of hepatocytes into the bile canaliculi using specific transporters.

> [!NOTE] Neonatal jaundice
> In newborns, enzyme activities are still significantly limited. Above all, glucuronyltransferase, which catalyzes the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid among other functions, is not yet sufficiently present. Additionally, due to a shortened lifespan of erythrocytes in the first weeks of life, more bilirubin is produced. If glucuronyltransferase is unable to metabolize this bilirubin adequately, it accumulates in various body tissues - including the skin - and causes a yellow discoloration of the latter. This neonatal jaundice (icterus neonatorum) occurs in about 50% of all newborns around the 3rd to 8th day.

### Induction and Inhibition of the Biotransformation System

The enzymes of the biotransformation system - foremost among them the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases - are induced by their substrates. However, there are also a number of other substances that can cause induction or inhibition. An important enzyme in this context is the isoform CYP3A4, as many medications are metabolized by it.

- Inductors: e.g. Glucocorticoids, Barbiturates
- Inhibitors: e.g. grapefruit juice, protease inhibitors (antiviral medications)

> [!NOTE] CYP induction (as part of the CYP-P450 system)
> The induction of the biotransformation system is of great clinical importance, as it can alter the metabolism and thus the efficacy of medications. For example, the increased expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes by rifampicin can cause oral contraceptives to be broken down more quickly, thereby losing their effectiveness. The induction of CYP3A4 ensures that certain blood pressure and anti-epileptic medications are metabolized more quickly and lose their efficacy. In contrast, the inactivation of CYP3A4 causes these same medications to accumulate in the body and remain effective for a longer period. These relationships must be kept in mind when prescribing medications that are metabolized by or affect the CYP system (see also "Cytochrome P450 System").

### Special Features

- Activation of substances through biotransformation
    - Prodrugs: Medications that are administered in an inactive precursor form and then converted into their active metabolites after absorption while passing through the liver.
    - Giftung: Conversion of a normally harmless substance into a toxic metabolite by biotransformation enzymes
- Genetics: The endowment of each individual with biotransformation enzymes varies significantly.

> [!NOTE] Paracetamol intoxication
> A well-known example of a toxic reaction is paracetamol intoxication: Paracetamol is a mild analgesic (pain reliever) and antipyretic (fever reducer) and is mostly eliminated through glucuronidation and sulfation. However, a small portion is oxidized and excreted as a glutathione S-conjugate. If the amount of oxidized paracetamol exceeds the amount of glutathione, the oxidized paracetamol reacts with free SH groups on certain macromolecules of hepatocytes. This binding can lead to cell destruction and potentially to life-threatening liver necrosis.

> [!NOTE] Carcinogenicity of Benzene and Toluene
> The cyclic hydrocarbon benzene (C6H6) is oxidized during metabolism by cytochrome P450-dependent mixed-function monooxygenases, resulting in the formation of benzene oxide. This highly reactive metabolite, along with other metabolic products of benzene oxide, is attributed with a carcinogenic effect. The cyclic hydrocarbon toluene (C7H8, trivial name: methylbenzene) resembles benzene in many properties and is also oxidized by monooxygenases. However, since toluene is oxidized to benzoate at its methyl group rather than at the ring, it does not exhibit carcinogenic effects.

## Development

The development of the liver begins as early as the end of the 2nd week of pregnancy and is roughly divided into two steps: the development of the parenchyma and the development of the intrahepatic vascular system. A special feature of the fetal liver is its ability for hematopoiesis, which it loses after birth.

### Development of Liver Parenchyma

- 3rd week post conception.
    - The liver bud grows as a sprout of the foregut (endoderm) at the level of the transverse septum into the ventral mesogastrium.
        - From the lower part, the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts develop
        - From the upper corner, intrahepatic bile ducts and liver parenchyma develop.
    - The connective tissue components of the liver as well as the cells of hematopoiesis originate from the mesoderm of the transverse septum.
    - Beginning of hematopoiesis
- 10th week post conception.
    - The liver accounts for about 10% of body weight.
- 12th week post conception.
    - Liver cells begin with bile production
    - The cystic duct and the common hepatic duct unite to form the common bile duct.
    - In the context of the gastric rotation, the opening of the common bile duct shifts from right to left.

### Development of the intrahepatic vascular system

The development of the intrahepatic vascular system originates from the vitelline veins (Vv. vitellinae), which run alongside the gut tube. It begins similarly to the development of the parenchyma starting from the 3rd week post conception. A portion of the embryonic liver vessels obliterates after birth and remains as ligaments of the liver.

|Embryonic Liver Vessels|   |Postnatal Vessels and Structures|
|---|---|---|
|Vv. vitellinae|Cranial part|V. cava inferior|
|Middle Part|Liver Sinusoids|
|Caudal part|V. porta hepatis, V. mesenterica superior|
|Efferent veins of the liver|   |Hepatic veins|
|Umbilical vein|   |Round ligament of the liver|
|Venous duct|   |Venous ligament|

## Glucose Homeostasis

Glucose homeostasis refers to the regulation of blood sugar levels through the body's own processes.

### Mechanisms

- Raising the blood sugar level
    - Glycogenolysis
    - Gluconeogenesis
    - Degradation of insulin
- Lowering of blood sugar levels
    - Glycogen synthesis
    - Glycolysis

> [!NOTE] Hypoglycemia in acute alcohol intoxication
> The consumption of alcohol on an empty stomach affects glucose homeostasis and can lead to life-threatening hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) due to an inhibition of gluconeogenesis. This occurs as follows: During the breakdown of ethanol, a large amount of NADH+H+ is produced. To balance this excess, pyruvate is metabolized to lactate and is thus no longer available as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Liver
### Macroscopic Anatomy

The liver is functionally divided into eight segments. What is the basis for this classification and which segments are located in which lobe of the liver?
- The functional division of the liver is based on the branches of the portal vein. The left liver lobe is formed by segments 2–4 and the right by 5–8, the caudate lobe (= segment 1) is usually considered separately.

Which ligament of the liver corresponds to the remnant of the embryonic umbilical vein?
- The ligamentum teres hepatis connects the liver with the navel and is a remnant of the obliterated embryonic umbilical vein.

Which ligaments of the liver together form the lesser omentum?
- The lesser omentum connects the liver with the stomach and duodenum and is accordingly formed by the hepatogastric and hepatoduodenal ligaments.

Which neighboring organs typically leave macroscopically visible indentations (impressions) on the surface of the left or right liver lobe?
- Since the liver is of soft consistency, neighboring organs leave visible indentations on its surface. For example, the right liver lobe shows impressions of the colon, duodenum, and right kidney. The stomach and esophagus leave impressions on the left liver lobe.

The naked area of the liver is the only part of the liver surface that is not covered by peritoneum. Which ligament of the liver borders this area?
- The area nuda denotes a region of the liver free of peritoneum, at the edge of which the visceral peritoneum of the liver folds over into the parietal peritoneum of the underside of the diaphragm. This fold is called the ligamentum coronarium hepatis.

### Microscopic Anatomy

Which vessels belong to the Glisson's triad? How can they be distinguished in a histological preparation?
- The Glisson's triad lies in the periportal fields of the liver lobules and consists of three parallel running structures: a branch of the hepatic portal vein (interlobular vein), which has a thin vessel wall and a wide lumen, a branch of the proper hepatic artery (interlobular artery), which is distinguished from the venous vessel by a smaller diameter and a thicker vessel wall, and a bile duct (interlobular bile duct), recognizable by its iso- to high-columnar epithelium and the absence of a muscular layer.

Describe the structure and blood flow within the liver sinusoids!
- The liver sinusoids are expanded capillaries containing mixed blood from branches of the hepatic portal vein and the proper hepatic artery, which drain into the central veins of their liver lobule. Their walls are lined with discontinuous endothelium, meaning there are large pores between the individual endothelial cells, allowing exchange of substances with the adjacent hepatocytes.

What is the so-called Disse space?
- The Disse space (perisinusoidal space) is a gap between the endothelial cells of the sinusoid and the hepatocytes. Blood plasma passes through the discontinuous endothelium of the sinusoid into this space and comes into contact with the microvilli of the hepatocytes. Thus, the actual exchange of substances between blood and liver parenchyma takes place in the Disse space.

Hepatocytes exhibit a polar structure and function, with distinct apical and basolateral cell poles. What delineates the apical pole of hepatocytes, and what is its function?
- The apical pole of the hepatocytes borders the bile canaliculi and is therefore also called the bile pole. It is responsible for the secretion of bile produced in the hepatocytes.

Describe the flow direction of bile within the bile canaliculi!
- Bile fluid is secreted at the apical pole of the hepatocytes into the bile canaliculi and flows from there to the interlobular bile duct in the periportal field. The flow thus occurs in the exact opposite direction to the blood flow in the sinusoids.

Which energy carrier is stored in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes?
- The liver, alongside muscle cells, is the main storage site for glycogen. This is present in large amounts in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and can be released as glucose when needed.

Describe the blood flow through the liver starting with the hepatic portal vein!
- The hepatic portal vein branches after its entry into the liver into the interlobular veins, which initially run parallel to branches of the proper hepatic artery in the so-called Glisson's triad of the periportal fields of the liver lobules. Then, the blood from both vessels mixes in the liver sinusoids and drains into the central veins. From there, it is drained via the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava.

### Biotransformation

In which cell organelle of liver cells does biotransformation take place?
- Biotransformation takes place in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes.

Describe the individual steps of ethanol breakdown!
- The breakdown of ethanol in hepatocytes begins with oxidation catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde (= ethanal). Acetaldehyde is oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to acetate, which is then converted into acetyl-CoA by thiokinase under ATP consumption.

What is meant by "detoxification" in connection with biotransformation?
- In the first phase of biotransformation, foreign substances are modified by oxidative reactions. It can happen that originally harmless substances (e.g., methanol) are transformed into toxic metabolites, which is referred to as poisoning.

What happens in the second phase of biotransformation? Name possible substances involved!
- In the second phase of biotransformation, the already modified foreign substances are conjugated with coupling substances (so-called conjugation). This produces water-soluble compounds that can be excreted via bile or urine. Typical coupling substances are glucuronic acid, acetyl-CoA, amino acids, and glutathione.

The biotransformation system is responsible for the breakdown of a variety of medications, which is why knowledge of inducers and inhibitors of the system is of great clinical importance. Name a typical inducer of biotransformation enzymes and possible consequences of induction for the metabolism of other medications!
- The enzymes of the biotransformation system—chiefly the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases—can be induced or inhibited by a number of substances. Typical inducers include barbiturates and the antibiotic rifampicin, which, by activating the enzyme CYP3A4, cause, among other things, accelerated breakdown and loss of efficacy of the birth control pill and certain blood pressure medications.

From which embryonic structure does the liver develop, and what important function does it already fulfill starting from the 3rd embryonic week?
- The liver primordium grows as a bud from the foregut (endoderm) at the level of the septum transversum (later diaphragm) into the ventral mesogastrium. From the 3rd embryonic week until birth, part of prenatal blood formation (hematopoiesis) takes place in the liver.
