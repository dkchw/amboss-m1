# Human Genetics (Preclinical)
## Summary

The genetic information of an organism is stored and inherited in the form of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA). In higher organisms, DNA is found divided among the chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Each organism has a characteristic number and shape of chromosomes: In humans, there are 46 chromosomes in the body cells, of which 23 come from the father and 23 from the mother. These chromosomes can be divided into 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.

The genetics describes the structure and function of chromosomes as well as the rules of inheritance and clarifies the underlying molecular mechanisms. In particular, it deals with diseases whose cause lies in the alteration of genetic information. These genetically-based diseases occur more frequently in families, which is why the analysis of family trees can be helpful in identifying them. In addition, various laboratory methods are available for diagnosis alongside clinical examination, to identify, for example, a mutation or chromosomal change that underlies a disease. In the case of suspected genetically-based diseases with unknown genetic makeup of the parents, the risk of a child for a recessively inherited disease can at least be estimated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle.
## Basic Concepts

To understand genetics (i.e., inheritance patterns, mutations, hereditary diseases, and the associated diagnostics), it must first be clear which level is being considered: the level of individual molecules (e.g., DNA, bases, nucleotides, nucleosomes) or the level of light-microscopically visible chromosomes. Are we dealing with the genetic basis of traits or their expression? Are we considering an individual and their family or an entire population? These levels are, of course, all interconnected or at least provide explanations for observations at other levels.

### Molecular Level and Chromosomes

- Gen: Basic unit of hereditary information; information-bearing section of DNA, defined by its base sequence and usually coding for a protein.
- Genlocus: Physical location of a gene on a chromosome
- Allele: One of two or more possible DNA sequences that can occur at a specific gene locus. An allele is typically a common variant, known as the wild-type allele, while the other alleles are mutations (or polymorphisms) and occur less frequently.
    - Diploid cells either have the same allele at a gene locus (on each chromosome), in which case they are homozygous. Or they have two different alleles at this gene locus, in which case they are referred to as heterozygous.
    - Polymorphism: A rarer allele that occurs within a population but with a certain frequency.
        - Example
            - A population consists of 500 individuals with a diploid chromosome set.
            - All genes occur in pairs, so there are a total of 1,000 copies of each gene in this population.
            - For a specific gene, there are two alleles, one of which represents a polymorphism.
            - The allele frequency for this mutated gene is 1% = 0.01. That is, 10 out of a total of 1,000 copies of the gene carry the same mutation.
            - Assuming that the individuals with the polymorphism are heterozygous, meaning they each carry only one copy of the mutated gene, and the other is the "normal" variant of the gene, 10 individuals must exhibit the polymorphism.
            - 10 individuals in a population of 500 individuals are 10/500 = 0.02 = 2%

### Characteristics, their genetic basis, and their expression

- Genotype: The complete set of genetic material of an individual
    - It is often referred to as genotype when one means a specific set of alleles at one or more specific gene loci.
    - The phenotype develops from the genotype in interaction with the environment.
    - In relation to the genotype, the following states are distinguished.
        - Homozygosity: The two alleles at a specific gene locus are identical
        - Heterozygosity: The two alleles at a specific gene locus are different.
        - Hemizygosity: There is only one allele of a gene in the genome. This is the case, for example, with genes located on the X or Y chromosome of the male.
- Phenotype: The sum of all observable characteristics of an individual
    - The phenotype is certainly determined by the combination of genotype and environmental factors. The traits include both the external appearance (e.g., eye or hair color) as well as the characteristics (e.g., behavior, personality) of the individual.
    - A trait can become differently pronounced in the phenotype.
        - Dominance and Recessiveness: If only one of the two alleles is phenotypically visible in heterozygosity, that allele is dominant over the other. The allele that is suppressed in the phenotype is recessive.
        - Codominance: Both traits are expressed simultaneously. The phenotype in heterozygosity differs from the two possible phenotypes in homozygosity.
            - Example: In the AB0 blood group system, blood groups A and B behave codominantly to each other (however, they are dominant over blood group 0).
            - Intermediate inheritance: A special case of codominant inheritance, where both traits are expressed at 50%.

### Individual, Family, Population

- Multiple Alleles: Within a population, more than two different alleles of a gene occur.
    - Occurrence: Likely in all human genes
    - Example: ABO blood group system
- Basic concepts related to genetic disorders
    - Penetrance: The probability that a genetic disorder will actually manifest in gene carriers.
    - Expressivity: Degree of manifestation of a genetic disorder in gene carriers
    - Compound heterozygosity: Two differently mutated alleles at the same gene locus, which can lead to a recessive disease occurring despite heterozygosity.
        - Example: Cystic fibrosis
    - Anticipation: When a disease increases in severity over several generations or manifests earlier with each generation.
        - Often in connection with trinucleotide repeat disorders
        - Example: Huntington's Chorea

> [!NOTE] Cystic fibrosis
> Cystic fibrosis, also known as mukoviszidose, is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder. Due to a mutation in the gene for a chloride channel, chloride ions are no longer transported out of the cells, which is associated with a disturbance of the water and salt balance in all exocrine gland tissues – thick, highly viscous secretions remain in the glands. This leads to chronic inflammation and consequently to organ damage, particularly of the lungs and pancreas.

## Genetics

During meiosis, 4 daughter cells are produced from a germ cell with recombined genetic material (mature sex cells, gametes). This is the molecular biological basis for the inheritance rules, i.e., the estimation of the probabilities of how often certain alleles of a gene are passed from the parent generation to the children.

### Mendelian Rules

- Conditions for the validity of Mendel's laws
    - Monogenic inheritance
    - Alleles are located on the autosomes and not on the gonosomes.

#### 1. Mendel's Law (Law of Uniformity)

- Offspring (filial generation, F1 generation) of homozygous parents that differ in the observed trait are, with regard to this trait, the same, namely heterozygous.
    - Depending on how inheritance occurs, the trait is expressed differently in the F1 generation.
        - Dominant-recessive inheritance: All members of the F1 generation resemble the parent that is homozygous for the dominant allele.
        - Codominant inheritance: All members of the F1 generation look the same, but resemble neither parent.
            - Example: ABO and HLA systems of blood type

> [!NOTE]
> 1. Mendel's Rule: The offspring of differently homozygous parents are all uniform heterozygous!

#### 2. Mendelian Rule (Law of Segregation)

- The children of parents who are both heterozygous for a specific trait are not all the same regarding this trait. Instead, you find various combinations of the alleles: ¼ of the children are homozygous for the dominant allele, ¼ of the children are homozygous for the recessive allele, and ½ of the children are heterozygous. The genotype thus divides in the ratio of 1:2:1.
    - The expression of traits in the offspring generation depends again on the mode of inheritance
        - Dominant-recessive inheritance: The expression of the trait is the same in children who are homozygous for the dominant allele and in heterozygous offspring. Only the offspring who are homozygous for the recessive allele look different (phenotype ratio: 3:1).
        - Codominant inheritance: Heterozygous offspring express both traits side by side, with the phenotype and genotype dividing as follows: 1:2:1
            - Intermediate inheritance: Heterozygous offspring have a mixed form of the trait. The ratio of the phenotype is the same as that of the genotype: 1:2:1.

> [!NOTE]
> 2. Mendel's Rule: The offspring of heterozygous parents are not uniform. The genotypes segregate in a ratio of 1:2:1!

#### 3. Mendel's Rule (Law of Independent Assortment)

- The inheritance of two or more traits occurs independently and according to the first two Mendelian rules.
    - Prerequisite: Independence of the combination possibilities of alleles, either because they are located on different chromosomes or far enough apart on one chromosome that they are most likely separated by recombination.

> [!NOTE]
> 3. Mendel's Rule: Two or more traits are inherited independently of one another (with certain limitations)!

### Autosomal dominant inheritance

- Even with a changed allele, the disease occurs.
- If one parent is affected, the risk for each child is 50% of having inherited the altered allele and consequently falling ill. If both parents are affected, the risk for the children even rises to 75%.
- For a homozygous parent, the risk of illness for a child is 100%.
- Even if both parents are ill, they can have a healthy child as long as neither parent is homozygously affected.
- Inheritance is independent of gender.
- Examples: Achondroplasia, Huntington's Chorea, Marfan Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Myotonic Dystrophy

> [!NOTE]
> In autosomal dominant diseases with complete penetrance, the manifestation of the trait typically does not skip any generations!

### Autosomal recessive inheritance

- Only when both alleles are altered does the disease occur.
    - Either through homozygosity for the altered allele or through compound heterozygosity
        - If both parents are homozygous and therefore affected, the probability of their children being affected is 100%
    - Heterozygous (and thus healthy) carriers of a recessive disease are called conductors.
        - If both parents are carriers (Nv), the following probabilities of disease for a common child arise: (1) Child is affected (vv): ¼, (2) Child is a carrier (Nv/vN): ½, (3) Child is healthy (NN): ¼ (see table)
        - Phenotypically healthy children of 2 carriers have a probability of ⅓ of not having a disease allele (NN), and ⅔ of them are also carriers (Nv/vN)
    - Probabilities for certain allele combinations over multiple generations can be multiplied to determine the likelihood of disease in children (illustrated in the example below)
        - 2 phenotypically healthy individuals are potential carriers, as they have affected siblings (the probability is ⅔ for each).
        - The children of the potential conductors have a probability of illness (vv) of ¼
        - The probability of illness in children is 1/9 without further knowledge (⅔ × ⅔ × ¼ = 1/9)
- Examples: Cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
- Pseudodominance: The probability that a homozygous affected parent and a heterozygous parent (carrier) will have an affected child is - as with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern - 50%.

### X-chromosomal recessive inheritance

- In X-linked recessive inheritance, the allele responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome.
- Women become ill only when both X chromosomes carry the altered allele (which is very rare).
    - If only one X chromosome is altered, the woman is phenotypically healthy, but she can pass the condition on to her children (carrier).
    - For the children of a conductor, there is a 50% chance of inheriting the altered X chromosome.
        - Sons who inherit their mother's altered X chromosome become ill
        - Daughters who inherit their mother's altered X chromosome are carriers.
        - The probability that a son of a conductor and a healthy father is phenotypically affected is 50% or ½.
- Men whose only X chromosome carries the altered allele always get sick! Therefore, there are no male carriers.
    - All daughters of an ill man inherit the altered X chromosome → If they receive an unaffected X chromosome from the mother, then the daughters are carriers (thus phenotypically healthy)
    - All sons of a sick man inherit their father's healthy Y chromosome and, with a high probability, a healthy X chromosome from their mother, which is why their risk of illness corresponds to that of the general population.
- Examples: Color blindness (Protanomaly, Deuteranomaly), Hemophilia A/B, Muscular dystrophies type Duchenne and Becker-Kiener

> [!NOTE]
> In X-chromosomal recessive inheritance, all male offspring of an affected father (and a homozygous healthy mother) are healthy, do not carry the mutated allele, and therefore cannot pass it on!

### Mitochondrial Inheritance

During cell division, the mitochondria are randomly distributed among the daughter cells. Mitochondria with a mutation in their DNA (mtDNA) are passed on to the daughter cells to varying degrees. A mutation only becomes phenotypically visible when a certain number of mitochondria with mutated mtDNA have accumulated.

- Definition: In diseases passed on through a mitochondrial inheritance, the mutation is located in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
- Inheritance mechanism: Pure maternal inheritance
    - Only women pass on the mutation, but men can also be affected!
    - The inheritance does not follow Mendelian rules.
- Affected tissues: brain, eyes, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas
- Example: MERRF syndrome
- Special case: Many proteins involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis are encoded in the nuclear genome. Mutations in the genes for these proteins can lead to mitochondrial diseases, even though it is not a mitochondrial inheritance pattern. In these particular cases, however, inheritance follows Mendelian rules.

> [!NOTE] Leber's optic atrophy
> A mutation in the mitochondrial DNA leads to disturbances in ATP synthesis and thus to an undersupply of energy to the cells. The characteristic symptom of Leber's optic atrophy is sudden blindness caused by the degeneration of the optic nerve. 85% of those affected are men.

### Multifactorial Hereditary Diseases

- Definition: Multifactorial hereditary diseases are influenced by many factors: genetics, external influences such as lifestyle, environmental triggers, etc.
    - The risk of disease cannot be calculated according to Mendel, but must be estimated empirically.
- Frequency: In most diseases, it is a multifactorial occurrence.
    - Examples: Coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, psychoses
- Index case: First person with a genetic disorder in a family
- Carter Effect: The risk of recurrence is higher when the first person (index case) belongs to the empirically less affected gender. If the ill person has a generally lower risk of the disease based on their gender, then the hereditary factors must weigh even more heavily.
    - Example: Congenital hip dislocation
- Threshold effect: A threshold effect is referred to when, in multifactorial inheritance, a condition only manifests once a certain threshold is reached. This means that specific genetic and external factors must come together until a limit is exceeded, resulting in the full expression of the condition.
- Gene-Environment Interaction: Genetic predisposition influences susceptibility to an environmental factor.
    - Example: Children who have been subjected to physical or psychological violence and simultaneously carry a certain genetic predisposition (e.g., a defective monoamine oxidase A gene) have an especially high risk of developing antisocial behavior.

> [!NOTE] Multifactorial causes of diseases using mental illnesses as an example
> The development of mental disorders is usually multifactorial. Mental traits are often influenced by genes and environmental factors, and there is a correlation between genetic and environmental effects. Additionally, mental traits are typically influenced by multiple genes.

## Epigenetics

Epigenetics deals with the regulation of genetic activity and the influence of the environment on it. It does not examine the information encoded in the base sequence, but rather the environmentally triggered and heritable chemical changes of DNA and histone proteins.

### Main Mechanisms of Gene Activity Regulation

In epigenetically regulated genes, it is solely decisive whether they are transcribed or not. In contrast, classical genetics observes the presence or absence of a gene. The expression or repression of the gene is determined by chemical modifications of the bases (methylation) and of the histone proteins (various covalent changes), which are carried out by specialized enzymes.

- DNA Methylation: The linking of CH3 groups with cytosine bases of DNA by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). 5-Methylcytosine is formed.
    - Process: After DNA replication, the newly synthesized DNA strand is methylated (based on the template strand)
    - Location: So-called CpG islands
    - Influencing factors
        - Faulty DNA repair mechanisms
        - Environmental factors (including arsenic, components from food), that influence the activity of DNMTs
        - Insufficient intake of methyl donors (e.g., methionine) in the diet
        - Cancer cells often contain genes that are activated due to a lack of methylation.
    - Result: Methylation inhibits the transcription of the respective gene
- Histone modification: Chemical alteration of histone proteins
    - Result: So-called chromatin remodeling → Alteration of chromatin structure through the modification of histone proteins
    - Types of modifications
        - Acetylation
        - Methylation
        - Phosphorylation
        - Ubiquitination
        - Sumoylation
        - ADP-ribosylation
    - Examples
        - Acetylation on lysine residues of histone proteins by histone acetyltransferases causes the histones to have fewer positive charges, resulting in a weaker binding to DNA. The DNA can be transcribed more easily.
        - Methylation of amino acid residues (especially lysine) of histone proteins can lead to increased or decreased transcriptional activity, depending on which amino acid residue it occurs on.
    - Inheritance: The modification of histones and thus the activity state of the genes is passed on to the daughter cells during cell division.
- Regulatory RNAs: Short RNA molecules involved in the silencing of specific target genes at various levels (e.g., miRNAs)
    - Function of miRNA: Regulation of mRNA degradation and thereby inhibition of translation

### Typical Processes of Epigenetics

- Inactivation of the X chromosome
    - Lyon Hypothesis: In the cells of a female organism, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated.
        - The inactivation occurs at the transcription level through regulatory RNAs, so-called Xist RNA (X-inactive specific transcript)
        - The inactivated X chromosome (packaged as heterochromatin) is also referred to as a Barr body.
        - Random choice of the X chromosome that is deactivated in a cell
        - Inactivation occurs on the 12th to 16th day of embryonic development.
- Genomic Imprinting: Maternal and paternal genomes differ through epigenetic modifications. In the case of genetic imprinting, only the allele inherited from the mother or only the allele inherited from the father is expressed. The other is silenced.
    - With each cell division, the information regarding gene activity is passed on to the daughter cells. However, in the context of germ cell development, it is first deleted and then reprogrammed in a sex-specific manner.
    - Genomic imprinting only plays a role in a部分 of genes.
    - Examples of diseases in which genomic imprinting is involved in their development: Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome
## Hardy-Weinberg Law

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele frequencies (more specifically, the frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous trait bearers) remain constant from generation to generation.

- Allele frequency: The proportion of a specific allele of a gene within a population. These are relative frequencies that can take a value between 0 and 1.
- Heterozygote frequency: Proportion of heterozygous carriers of a mutated allele in the population
- Calculation using Hardy-Weinberg's law: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1 (= 100%) (see also: derivation of Hardy-Weinberg's law)
    - p or p2 = probability of carrying one (p) or two (p2) unchanged alleles
    - 2pq = Heterozygote frequency (= Probability of carrying one altered and one non-altered allele)
    - q or q2 = probability of carrying one (q) or two (q2) altered alleles
- Example calculation: A disease with a frequency in newborns of about 1:2500 (= q2, since only homozygous trait carriers become ill)
    - q = √(q2) = √(1/2500) = 1/50 = 2%
    - p: p + q = 1 → p = 1 − q = 1 − 1/50 = 0.98 (98%) ≈ 1
    - 2pq = 2×p×q = 2×1×1/50 = 1/25 = Heterozygote frequency
## Basics of Pedigree Analysis

The analysis of a family tree is intended to identify inheritance patterns of a specific trait. Within this context, one may discover clues regarding, for example, an autosomal-dominant inherited disease. Additionally, aside from the clinical symptoms, a potentially affected gene can be examined for a mutation or the karyotype can be determined.

- Definition: Representation of family relationships in a defined form, with a special focus on certain phenotypic characteristics of individual family members.
- Goal: Drawing conclusions from the phenotype to the genotype of family members and determining the inheritance pattern.
- Form
    - Symbols represent the individual family members
    - Lines between the symbols indicate the degrees of kinship.
    - The generations are designated with Roman numerals.
    - The children of a generation are designated in the order of their birth with Arabic numerals.
    - Infected family members, i.e. trait carriers, are represented by colored symbols.
- Questions in pedigree analysis
    1. Dominant or recessive inheritance?
        - Question 1: Does every sick family member have a parent who is also sick?
            - Yes → Dominant inheritance of the trait
            - No → Recessive inheritance of the trait
    2. Autosomal or gonosomal inheritance?
        - Question 2: Are mainly male family members affected? Yes → (probably) X-linked recessive inheritance
        - Question 3: Do all of the following criteria apply? Yes → (probably) X-linked dominant inheritance
            - Do all the sick men have an ill mother as well?
            - Are all the daughters of sick men also sick?
            - Do all sick fathers, together with a healthy woman, have healthy sons?
        - If none of these criteria apply and question 1 was answered positively, it is likely an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern. If question 1 was answered negatively, it is an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern.
## Types of Mutations

Mutations are heritable changes in the genome of a cell. They can occur due to errors in DNA replication as well as due to disruptions in cell division and ineffective DNA repair mechanisms. DNA damage from endogenous and exogenous toxins can also lead to gene and chromosome mutations.

### Mutations by Affected Cell Population

- Germline mutation: Transmission via the egg cells or sperm to the offspring
- Somatic mutation: Acquired mutations that are present only in a portion of the body cells and usually affect only one allele of a gene.
    - They do not occur in the germline and therefore cannot be transmitted through the egg cells or sperm.
    - Almost all malignancies are preceded by a somatic mutation.
- Two-hit hypothesis according to Knudson: If there is a mutation in one allele of a tumor suppressor gene and a second mutation also inactivates the other allele, a cell becomes a tumor cell. Therefore, two events (two "hits") are necessary to disable cell cycle control.
    - Example: Retinoblastoma
- Loss of Heterozygosity (LoH): Loss of one allele of a gene after the other allele has already been inactivated by a mutation.
- Uniparental Disomy: Presence of homologous chromosome pairs that come from only one parent and do not consist of one maternal and one paternal chromosome. The chromosome that originates from the other parent is not present.
    - This condition is associated with certain diseases, such as Prader-Willi syndrome.
- Mosaic: A mutation affects only a part of the body cells.
    - In a chromosomal mosaic, cell populations with different karyotypes are present in an organism.
        - Example: In Turner syndrome, there is often a gonosomal mosaic (some cells with X0, some cells with XX)
    - Germline mosaicism: When only a portion of the germ cells of an individual carries a mutation, it is referred to as germline mosaicism. It arises from a new mutation in the genome of a germ cell precursor during mitotic division in germline development.
    - Chimeras: The cells of an organism or tissue originate from different zygotes and therefore have different genetic material. This occurs, for example, when interconnected egg cells are fertilized.
- Special case: Mutations in genes responsible for DNA repair processes lead to chromosomal instability.
    - There is an increase in chromosome translocations, inversions, and deletions.
    - Occurrences: Fanconi anemia, Ataxia telangiectasia

### Chromosome Aberrations

- A visible change in the genome in the karyotype is called a chromosomal aberration.
- Numerical chromosome aberrations: Changed number of chromosomes
    - Aneuploidy: Individual chromosomes are duplicated or missing
        - Trisomies
            - Example: Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18) with the karyotype: ♀: 47, XX+18; ♂: 47, XY+18
            - More examples: Trisomy 21, Trisomy 13
        - Monosomies
            - Example: Turner syndrome with the karyotype 45, X0, female phenotype
        - Polysomy of the sex chromosomes: Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), XYY syndrome, Poly-X syndrome
            - Multiple X chromosomes have relatively minor effects, as excess ones are predominantly deactivated as Barr bodies.
    - Polyploidy: The entire set of chromosomes is multiplied, e.g. triploidy (3 × 23 = 69, XXY/XXX)
- Structural chromosomal aberrations: Changed structure of chromosomes with a constant number of chromosomes.
    - Verification usually through FISH
    - Deletion: Loss of one or more base pairs or entire chromosome segments, e.g. Cri-du-Chat syndrome (46,XX/XY del(5))
    - Duplication: Doubling of a chromosome segment
    - Inversion: Inversion of a chromosomal segment
        - When the centromere is included, it is referred to as a pericentric inversion; when it is not included, it is called a paracentric inversion (nomenclature example: 46,XX,inv(8)(p12p22))
    - Translocation: Shift of a chromosome segment to another (non-homologous) chromosome
        - Balanced translocation: The sum of the genetic material remains the same.
            - Therefore, there are no phenotypic abnormalities.
            - Increased risk for offspring with unbalanced translocation
            - E.g. balanced Robertsonian translocation (45,XY/XX,rob(14;21))
        - Unbalanced translocation: The sum of the genetic material changes
            - Deletion or duplication of chromosome segments during translocation

### Gene Mutations

- Possible types of gene mutations are
    - Point mutation: Change of a single base pair in the DNA
    - Deletion: Loss of one or more base pairs
    - Insertion: One or more base pairs are added
    - Substitution: One or more base pairs are replaced by other base pairs.
    - Trinucleotide repeat mutations: Increased repetition of a base triplet leads, among other things, to erroneous protein synthesis or folding.
        - Trinucleotide repeat disorders: E.g. Fragile X syndrome, Huntington's chorea, Myotonic dystrophy
- Depending on the sequence of the gene mutation, one distinguishes:
    - Frame-shift mutations: Shift of the reading frame due to deletion and insertion of base pairs (number not divisible by 3!) leads to a changed amino acid sequence.
    - In-frame deletion or insertion: loss or insertion of three, six, nine, or more base pairs (always triplets!), without shifting the reading frame, but with loss or insertion of one, two, three, or more amino acids in the protein during translation.
    - Silent mutations: Changed codon that still codes for the same amino acid.
    - Nonsense mutation: The formation of a stop codon that leads to a premature termination of translation and thus results in a truncated protein.
    - Missense mutations: Altered codon encoding for a different amino acid
    - Splice mutation: Changes (particularly point mutations) in the nucleotide sequences necessary for the splicing process (e.g., at the exon-intron boundaries or at the branch point) lead to faulty mRNAs and truncated proteins; the loss of an entire exon is possible.
## Methods of Genetic Diagnostics

Molecular biological methods are used in the (prenatal) diagnostics of hereditary diseases, including the detection of gene mutations. In addition, they also find applications in many other areas of medicine, such as the diagnostics of infectious diseases (e.g., diphtheria), in forensics, and in tumor diagnostics. As a sample material, DNA from nucleated blood cells is typically used, or in prenatal diagnostics, DNA from chorionic villi.

### Genetic Markers

Many genetic loci vary relatively significantly within a population. In some non-coding regions of the genome, there are often repeating sequences of different lengths. These repetitive sequences differ in the length of the sequence motif. The frequency of the repetitions varies among individuals. DNA polymorphisms form the basis, for example, for the diagnosis of diseases and also serve for the identification of individuals.

- Genetic markers (or DNA markers) are individual differences in the DNA sequence of a specific section of the genome. Three different markers are used for DNA analysis.
    - Microsatellites: Short tandem repeats, STRs, sequence repeats of a few base pairs in DNA that are highly polymorphic. Their analysis by PCR is used for individual identification. Even very small amounts of DNA are sufficient for detection.
    - SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism): Variants in the DNA occurring in the population that differ by only one base pair. They often arise from errors in DNA replication and are thus point mutations.
    - RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism): Depending on the DNA sequence of an individual, different lengths of DNA fragments can be produced when cutting the chromosomal DNA with restriction enzymes. They are detected using the Southern blot method followed by detection of the fragments via probes. Because mutations can create or eliminate cut sites, RFLPs were previously used to search for mutations in the genome.
- "Genetic fingerprint": DNA profile of an individual, especially established through analysis of microsatellite DNA.

> [!NOTE] Sickle Cell Disease
> The sickle cell disease is an autosomal co-dominant inherited disorder. Under conditions of oxygen deficiency, red blood cells adopt a characteristic sickle shape, which can lead to the blockage of blood vessels and organ damage. The cause is a point mutation in the gene for the β-chain of hemoglobin, which binds the oxygen to be transported in red blood cells. The mutation causes a glutamate residue in sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) to be replaced by a valine residue compared to normal hemoglobin. HbS has a changed protein structure and its solubility is greatly reduced when it has not bound oxygen. The mutation in the gene for the β-chain causes an RFLP: different DNA fragments are generated due to the absence of a cleavage site.

### Evidence of Gene Mutations (DNA Diagnostics, Molecular Genetic Examination)

DNA diagnostics is suitable for directly or indirectly detecting or excluding a gene mutation that results in a disease.

#### Direct evidence

- Requirement: The disease-causing gene is known.
- Approach
    - Amplification of a specific area of the respective gene using PCR
    - Evidence of the gene mutation, e.g., through sequencing or by cutting the DNA with restriction enzymes
        - Restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease)
            - Definition: Enzyme that cut double-stranded DNA at enzyme-specific base sequences.
            - Most interfaces are palindromes (reverse sequence repetitions)
            - The result of cutting with restriction enzymes (so-called restriction digestion) is DNA fragments with overhanging ends ("sticky ends") or blunt ends (blunt ends)
            - Origin of restriction enzymes: Defense system of prokaryotes against foreign DNA
    - Analysis using gel electrophoresis: Most detection methods are based on a changed mobility of DNA fragments in gel electrophoresis. Mutated and normal alleles are compared in this process.

#### Indirect Evidence (Linkage Analysis)

Indirect DNA diagnostics are performed when direct diagnostics are not possible. A prerequisite for this is that a disease has occurred multiple times in the family and the corresponding gene locus is known.

- Principle: Investigation of genetic markers associated with the mutated gene and comparison of the patient's genotype with that of unaffected family members.
- Result: No direct evidence of a gene mutation, but a probability of the presence of a specific disease-causing mutation (risk assessment). The validity of indirect DNA diagnostics depends on the type of inheritance and how many family members are examined.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Human Genetics (Preclinical)
### Basic Concepts

Explain the term multiple alleles and give an example!
- Multiple alleles refer to a situation in a population, e.g., the population of a country, where more than two different alleles exist for a gene. An example is the ABO blood group system.
What is meant by compound heterozygosity? Give an example!
- Compound heterozygosity is a term used in connection with genetic disorders: When in an affected individual both chromosomes have mutations in the same gene but at different locations, this is called compound heterozygosity. Cystic fibrosis is an example of such an inherited disease.
### Genetics

Do all offspring get sick with autosomal dominant inheritance?
- In autosomal dominant inheritance, the disease manifests already with one affected allele, as the mutated allele dominates over the healthy one. However, if both parents are heterozygous carriers of the trait, they can still have a healthy child. Schematically, this could look like this: Dominantly inherited mutated allele: V, normal allele v → Parent generation Vv and Vv, offspring generation VV, Vv, Vv, vv.
What is the probability of an autosomal recessive disease in children of heterozygous parents?
- In autosomal recessive inheritance, the disease only manifests in homozygous carriers. The probability of being affected is 25%, for heterozygotes (carriers) 50%, and for homozygous healthy children 25%.
What is the probability that a carrier of an X-linked recessive disease passes on her altered chromosome?
- A female carrier of an X-linked recessive disease passes on her altered chromosome with a probability of 50% to her children. Sons who inherit this chromosome will be affected, daughters become carriers.
Does the daughter of a man with an X-linked recessive condition become ill from it? What about his sons?
- A man with an X-linked recessive disease always transmits the affected X chromosome to his daughters, making them carriers. Sons inherit the healthy Y chromosome and likely a healthy X chromosome from their mother; their risk of disease corresponds to that of the general population.
Explain the concept of gene-environment interaction!
- The so-called "gene-environment interaction" describes the fact that the expression of traits often depends not only on the genetic predisposition of an individual but also on environmental conditions.
For which group of diseases is gene-environment interaction often applicable?
- Gene-environment interaction often influences mental illnesses. These are mostly multifactorial and usually only exhibit their phenotypic expression due to certain environmental influences.
### Epigenetics

What mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation do you know?
- Epigenetic mechanisms influence the readout of genes. This happens, among other ways, through methylation of bases in the DNA, various chemical modifications of histone proteins, and regulatory RNAs.
Explain the epigenetic regulation mechanism of DNA methylation!
- In epigenetics, methylation of specific bases in regulatory DNA sequences serves to regulate gene expression. The associated gene is then no longer transcribed. Methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and links CH3 groups to cytosine bases in so-called "CpG islands," forming 5-methylcytosine.
Name examples of modifications of histone proteins!
- Histone modifications include acetylation and methylation (not to be confused with DNA methylation!). These chemical changes affect the chromatin structure and thereby the accessibility of DNA.
What happens during the acetylation of histone proteins?
- Histone acetyltransferases transfer acetyl groups to lysine side chains of histone proteins, reducing their positive charge, decreasing electrostatic interaction with DNA, and causing positively charged histones and negatively charged DNA to bind less tightly. Due to this relaxation, DNA is present as euchromatin and can be transcribed.
What is a Barr body?
- Women, with their double X chromosome, could otherwise produce double the amount of gene products. To prevent this, one X chromosome is inactivated by regulatory RNAs. It is present as heterochromatin and is called the Barr body.
### Hardy-Weinberg Law

What is the formula of the Hardy-Weinberg law?
- The Hardy-Weinberg law states: (p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 (100%). p (or p^2) = probability of carrying 1 (or 2) normal alleles; 2pq = probability of carrying one mutated and one normal allele (heterozygote frequency); q (or q^2) = probability of carrying 1 (or 2) mutated alleles.
What does the Hardy-Weinberg principle state and what is the corresponding formula?
- The Hardy-Weinberg law states that the frequency of homozygous and heterozygous carriers remains constant over generations. The relationship between allele frequency and the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) and homozygotes (p^2 or q^2) can be summarized by the formula p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.
How is the inheritance pattern of cystic fibrosis? What genetic defect is present?
- Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessively inherited metabolic disorder. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, resulting in defective chloride channels that insufficiently transport chloride ions extracellularly. Consequently, thick mucus is produced, which cannot drain properly and leads to increased inflammation.
### Basics of Pedigree Analysis

What characterizes a pedigree with generally dominant inheritance of the observed trait, and how can autosomal dominant inheritance be specifically recognized?
- With dominant inheritance, every affected family member has at least one affected parent. In autosomal dominant inheritance, the transmission is independent of sex, so both men and women are affected.
### Types of Mutations

How do germline mutations differ from somatic mutations?
- Germline mutations affect sperm or egg cells and are therefore present in all cells of the offspring. Somatic mutations, by contrast, are acquired during one's lifetime. They are only present in some cells and usually affect only one allele of a gene. Somatic mutations are typically found in malignancies.
What are chromosomal aberrations and what types do you know?
- Chromosomal aberrations are genome changes visible in karyograms. They are distinguished into numerical chromosomal aberrations, where the number of chromosomes changes, and structural aberrations, which involve altered chromosome structure with unchanged chromosome number.
What is meant by aneuploidy and polyploidy? Provide examples of corresponding diseases for each!
- Numerical chromosomal aberrations can involve deviation of the number of single chromosomes from normal (aneuploidy) or multiplication of the entire chromosome set (polyploidy). Examples of aneuploidy include trisomies (e.g., trisomy 21), monosomies (e.g., Turner syndrome with karyotype 45, X0), and polysomies (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome with karyotype 47, XXY). An example of polyploidy is triploidy (3 × 23 = 69, XXY/XXX).
What structural chromosomal aberrations do you know?
- Frame-shift mutations result from deletion or insertion of a number of base pairs not divisible by three, causing a shifted reading frame during translation. The amino acid sequence of the synthesized protein is altered. In-frame mutations, on the other hand, involve insertion or deletion of three (or multiples of three) base pairs. The reading frame remains preserved.
What is the difference between frame-shift mutations and in-frame mutations?
- Frame-shift mutations occur due to deletion or insertion of a number of base pairs not divisible by three, altering the reading frame during translation and changing the amino acid sequence of the synthesized protein. In-frame mutations involve insertion or deletion of three (or multiples of three) base pairs, preserving the reading frame.
What is a splice mutation?
- A splice mutation leads to changes in nucleotide sequences that are necessary for the splicing process. This can result in shortened or defective mRNAs and proteins.
### Methods of Genetic Diagnostics

What are genetic markers and which are used in DNA analysis?
- Genetic markers are known sequences in human DNA that are uniquely identifiable. Often, the unique composition of repetitive DNA sequences for each person is used for identification, e.g., microsatellites, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), and RFLPs (restriction fragment length polymorphisms). Genetic markers are also used for disease diagnostics.
How can gene mutations be detected directly?
- Direct detection of gene mutations requires knowledge of the disease-causing gene. Once known, a specific region of this gene is first amplified by PCR. Then, cutting the amplified DNA with restriction enzymes can, for example, be used to detect the mutation. Finally, the resulting fragments are analyzed, e.g., by gel electrophoresis.
Explain how restriction enzymes work! Do you know where they originate from?
- Restriction enzymes, also called restriction endonucleases, were originally isolated from bacteria, where they serve as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. They cut double-stranded DNA only at enzyme-specific sites, usually palindromes, i.e., sequences that read identically in both directions. The cuts can produce blunt ends (cuts directly opposite each other) or sticky ends (cuts offset by a few base pairs).
