# Nerve pathways of the upper extremity
## Summary

The arterial supply of the upper extremity is provided by the A. subclavia, which originates from the aorta or the Truncus brachiocephalicus. After passing through the posterior scalene gap, it transitions into the A. axillaris, which supplies most of the shoulder girdle and then becomes the A. brachialis. After this artery supplies the upper arm, it branches in the elbow into the A. ulnaris and the A. radialis, which run along the forearm to the hand. The arteries are accompanied by veins of the same name. In addition to these deep veins, there are superficial veins that can be used, for example, for blood draws.

The upper extremity is innervated by the brachial plexus – a nerve network formed from the ventral rami of the spinal nerves C5–Th1. These initially combine into three primary trunks, forming the supraclavicular part of the brachial plexus. Below the clavicle, the three primary trunks give rise to three secondary cords. These form the infraclavicular part of the brachial plexus, from which the radial, ulnar, and median nerves arise.

The lymph of the upper extremity collects in the axillary lymph nodes and is directed from there into the subclavian trunk.
## Arteries

The shoulder girdle is supplied by the subclavian artery and the axillary artery. The subclavian artery arises on the left directly from the aorta, on the right from the brachiocephalic trunk and transitions into the axillary artery between the clavicle and the first rib. From the axillary artery, the vessels of the free upper limb arise: For the upper arm, the brachial artery is responsible. This divides at the level of the elbow into the radial artery and the ulnar artery, which supply the forearm and the hand.

### A. subclavia in the area of the upper extremity

    - A. suprascapularis
    - A. transversa colli → A. dorsalis scapulae
- Important anastomoses
    - Shoulder blade anastomosis between A. suprascapularis and A. circumflexa scapulae (from A. axillaris)
    - Acromial network
- Service area: Shoulder

### A. axillaris

- Origin: From A. subclavia
- Course
    - Is located in the axilla laterally to the V. axillaris and is surrounded by the branches of the brachial plexus.
    - Anastomoses extensively through its branches with the A. subclavia
    - Goes distal to the axilla in the brachial artery over

    - Scapular anastomosis
    - Vascular ring around the surgical neck: Between the anterior circumflex humeral artery and the posterior circumflex humeral artery
- Service area: Shoulder

### A. brachialis

- Origin: From A. axillaris
- Course
    - Pulls distally in the medial bicipital groove
    - Branches in the elbow into A. radialis and A. ulnaris
- Branches
    - A. profunda brachii → A. nutriciae humeri → A. collateralis media and A. collateralis radialis
    - A. superior ulnar collateral
    - A. inferior ulnar collateral
- Important anastomoses:
    - Elbow joint network: Is fed by the collateral arteries and the radial recurrent artery (from the radial artery)
- Service area: Upper arm and elbow

> [!NOTE]
> The elbow articular network represents a sufficient collateral circulation. Distal to the origin of the deep brachial artery, the brachial artery can be easily occluded. However, before this origin, it should never be occluded due to the lack of collaterals!

### A. radialis

- Origin: From A. brachialis
- Course
    - Runs in the radial vessel-nerve pathway
    - Runs between the tendons of the M. flexor carpi radialis and the M. brachioradialis
    - Acts on the wrist in a dorsal direction.
    - Runs through the Tabatière into the deep hollow hand
- Branches
    - A. recurrens radialis
    - R. carpalis palmaris
    - R. palmaris superficialis
    - Dorsal carpals
    - Dorsal metacarpal arteries → Dorsal digital arteries

    - Deep palmar arch: Between the terminal branch of the radial artery and the deep palmar branch (from the ulnar artery)
- Supply area: Forearm and Hand

> [!NOTE] Allen-Test
> The radial artery is often used for arterial blood sampling at the wrist. However, before puncturing it, one must ensure that the collateral circulation via the ulnar artery (superficial palmar arch and deep palmar arch) is functioning, ensuring that blood flow to the hand is maintained even if the artery to be punctured is occluded. For this purpose, the examining person first compresses both arteries at the wrist and instructs the examined person to repeatedly clench their fist until the palm turns white. Then, they release one of the arteries and observe whether the entire hand turns red again, repeating the same with the second artery. This is referred to as the Allen test.

### A. ulnaris

- Origin: From A. brachialis
- Progress
    - Runs in the ulnar vessel-nerve street
    - Enter through the Guyon Lodge

> [!NOTE] Pulse Diagnostics
> Some arteries are easily palpable at certain points. This characteristic is utilized by the examining person during pulse diagnostics. In the upper arm, one can palpate the A. axillaris in the axilla and the A. brachialis in the medial bicipital groove (medial upper arm). In the forearm, the A. radialis is located at the radial wrist as well as in the anatomical snuffbox and the A. ulnaris at the ulnar wrist.

## Veins

The venous drainage of the upper extremity divides into a superficial and a deep venous system.

### Deep Venous System

- Course: Usually with the namesake artery (see above)
- Confluences: V. ulnaris and V. radialis → V. brachialis → V. axillaris → V. subclavia

### Superficial Venous System

- Dorsal venous network of the hand
    - Course: Back of the hand to forearm
    - Mouths
        - Radial: V. cephalica
        - Ulnar: V. basilica
- Cephalic vein
    - Course: Forearm to Upper arm (here in the lateral bicipital groove)
    - Opening: V. axillaris under the clavicle in the infraclavicular fossa (“Mohrenheim pit”)
- V. basilica
    - Course: Runs along the upper arm in the medial bicipital groove
    - Confluence: V. brachialis

> [!NOTE] Venous Blood Collection
> The V. cephalica and the V. basilica are connected in the elbow by the V. mediana cubiti. This vein is located immediately subcutaneous and is therefore ideally suited for blood draws or venous injections. However, care must be taken to insert the needle at a shallow angle, as there is a risk of puncturing the vein and inadvertently puncturing the A. brachialis.

> [!NOTE] CVC
> The subclavian vein can be used for placing a central venous catheter (CVC) between the clavicle and the first rib. Especially in cases of volume depletion, it is a popular alternative to the jugular vein, as it is stretched between the 1st rib and the collarbone and is therefore always open. However, due to its anatomical proximity to the pleural dome, there is a risk of pneumothorax.

## Brachial Plexus - Overview

For the innervation of the upper extremity, the brachial plexus is responsible. It is a network of nerves formed from the ventral rami of the spinal nerves C5–Th1. These combine to form the three primary trunks from which the nerves of the supraclavicular part of the brachial plexus arise. From the primary trunks, the three secondary cords are then formed below the clavicle, which give rise to the nerves of the infraclavicular part.

### Formation of the brachial plexus

- Originating branches: Ventral rami of the spinal nerves C5–Th1
- Process of plexus formation
    1. Formation of the primary trunks: Rr. ventrales (C5–Th1) form Pars supraclavicularis with three primary trunks (truncus superior, medius, and inferior) and direct branches.
    2. Formation of the secondary trunks: Primary trunks of the supraclavicular part form the so-called secondary trunks (lateral fasciculus, medial and posterior) of the infraclavicular part
    3. Splitting into terminal branches: secondary strands separate into the individual nerves of the infraclavicular part on

### Overview of the nerves of the brachial plexus

1. Supraclavicular part
    - Trunci: Superior trunk (C5 and C6), middle (C7) and inferior (C8 and Th1)
    - Nerves of the supraclavicular part
        - N. dorsalis scapulae (C3–C5)
        - N. subclavius (C5–C6)
        - Suprascapular nerve (C4–C6)
        - Long thoracic nerve (C5–C7)
2. Infraclavicular region
    - Fasciculi: Lateral fasciculus, medial, and posterior
    - Associated nerves
        - Lateral fasciculus
            - N. musculocutaneus (C5–C7)
            - N. medianus, lateral part (C6–C7)
            - Lateral pectoral nerve (C5–C7)
        - Medial fasciculus
            - Medial pectoral nerve (C8–Th1)
            - N. medianus, medial part (C8–Th1)
            - Ulnar nerve (C8–Th1)
            - Medial cutaneous nerve of the arm (C8–Th1)

            - Subscapular nerves (C5–C7)
            - N. thoracodorsalis (C6–C8)
## Supraclavicular Part

The ventral roots of the spinal nerves C5–Th1 form the three primary trunks of the brachial plexus after passing through the scalene gap in the external cervical triangle. From these, the nerves of the supraclavicular part emerge. All of these are purely motor, meaning they have no sensory innervation areas.

- Primary trunks of the brachial plexus
    - Superior trunk (from C5 and C6)
    - Middle trunk (from C7)
    - Inferior trunk (from C8 and Th1)

### The Nerves of the Pars supraclavicularis

|Nerve / Segment|Course|Innervated Muscles|
|---|---|---|
|N. dorsalis scapulae<br><br>C3–C5|- Passes through the M. scalenus medius into the lateral neck region<br>- Reaches under the M. levator scapulae to the scapula<br>- Runs caudally along the medial border of the scapula|- M. levator scapulae<br>- Mm. rhomboidei|
|N. subclavius<br><br>C5–C6|- Thin, short nerve that directly innervates the M. subclavius |- M. subclavius|
|N. suprascapularis<br><br>C4–C6|- Runs dorsal to the clavicle beneath the trapezius muscle and the superior transverse scapular ligament into the supraspinatus fossa<br>- From there, it continues along the inferior transverse scapular ligament into the infraspinatus fossa|- Supraspinatus muscle<br>- Infraspinatus muscle|
|Long thoracic nerve<br><br>C5–C7|- Pierces the middle scalene muscle<br>- Runs along the edge of the anterior serratus muscle downwards|- anterior serratus muscle|

> [!NOTE] Regional anesthesia of the brachial plexus
> In surgical procedures on the upper extremity, regional anesthesia of the brachial plexus is often used. Depending on the surgical procedure, the brachial plexus can be anesthetized at four different points: 1. In the scalene gap, 2. in the lateral neck triangle (supraclavicular), 3. in the space below the clavicle (infraclavicular), 4. in the axilla (axillary).

> [!NOTE] Plexus paralysis
> In the case of damage to the brachial plexus (e.g., due to excessive stretching during birth or from nerve root avulsions in motorcycle accidents), a plexus paralysis can occur. A distinction is made between an upper plexus paralysis (Erb-Duchenne) involving the C5–C6 segments and a lower plexus paralysis (Klumpke) involving the C8–Th1 segments. Although the nerves of the brachial plexus contain a mix of fibers from the individual segments, it is the case that the contributions from the upper segments tend to innervate the proximal structures, while the contributions from the lower segments tend to innervate the distal structures. In upper plexus paralysis, consequently, movement in the shoulder and elbow joints is primarily affected, whereas in lower plexus paralysis, movement in the hand and finger joints is more affected.

## Infraclavicular Parts

The three primary trunks of the supraclavicular part form the three secondary strands below the clavicle. From these, the nerves of the infraclavicular part of the brachial plexus arise.

- Secondary branches of the brachial plexus
    - Lateral fasciculus
    - Medial fasciculus
    - Posterior fasciculus

### N. medianus

- Origin: C6–Th1, Lateral fasciculus (lateral median portion) and Medial fasciculus (medial median portion)
- Progress
    - The lateral part from the Fasciculus lateralis and the medial part from the Fasciculus medialis come together in the axillary cavity at the front of the A. axillaris and form here the so-called median loop.
    - Runs in the medial bicipital groove up to the elbow (gives off muscular branches)
    - Passes between the two heads of the M. pronator teres (pronator canal) (release of the N. interosseus antebrachii anterior)
    - Runs along the forearm in the median nerve pathway (branching of the R. palmaris)
    - Pass through the carpal tunnel to the hand
    - Here: Division into three Nn. digital palm trees communes
        - Endpoints: Nn. digital personal achievements

        - M. pronator quadratus
    - M. abductor pollicis brevis
    - M. flexor pollicis brevis (Superficial head)
    - M. opponens pollicis
    - Mm. lumbricales I and II

> [!NOTE] Median Nerve Palsy
> The median nerve can be damaged at various points along its path, leading to different patterns of injury (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, anterior interosseous syndrome). If the nerve is damaged in the area of the upper arm or the elbow, there will be weakness in pronation of the forearm (pronator teres muscle), a loss of opposition of the thumb, and a loss of flexion in the thumb, index, and middle fingers. Since the flexors of the fingers IV and V are supplied by the ulnar nerve, closing the fist results in the appearance of the so-called claw hand. In addition to the atrophy of the thenar muscles, there is also a disturbance of sensation in the innervation area of the median nerve.

### Ulnar nerve

- Origin: C8–Th1, Medial fasciculus
- Course
    - Medially, the axillary artery runs in the medial bicipital groove
    - Pulls through the medial intermuscular septum on the dorsal side in the middle of the upper arm into the extensor compartment.
    - Passes around the ulnar nerve sulcus around the elbow joint (distribution of the articular branches and muscular branches)
    - Reaches through the cubital tunnel back to the flexor side of the arm (branch of the R. dorsalis manus, which again pulls dorsal, and of the R. cutaneus palmaris)
        - Palmar cutaneous nerve
            - Only those N. ulnaris
            - Divides in front of the wrist into its terminal branches R. superficialis and R. profundus n. ulnaris (the latter is a purely motor branch and runs medially to the A. ulnaris through the Guyon’s canal to the hand)
- Important branches
    - Articular surfaces of the elbow
    - Muscle fibers
    - R. dorsalis ulnar nerve with digital dorsal nerves
    - R. palmaris
    - R. profundus (rein motor branch)
    - Superficial veins (e.g. sensory branch)

    - M. adductor pollicis
    - M. flexor pollicis brevis (Deep head)
    - Mm. lumbricales III and IV

> [!NOTE] Ulnar Nerve Palsy
> The ulnar nerve can be damaged at various points along its course (e.g., in the Guyon’s canal or the hollow hand), leading to different patterns of impairment. In the case of a proximal lesion (e.g., in the ulnar nerve sulcus), the loss of all interossei muscles and the lumbrical muscles III and IV results in hyperextension of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints during fist closure. This is referred to as the so-called claw hand, primarily affecting fingers III and IV, as the lumbrical muscles I and II are innervated by the median nerve. Due to the loss of the adductor pollicis muscle, the thumb can no longer be adducted. Additionally, sensory disturbances occur in the area of innervation of the ulnar nerve. Several months after the injury, there is primarily atrophy of the interossei muscles and the hypothenar muscles.

### N. radialis

- Origin: C5–Th1, Posterior fasciculus
- Course
    - It lies dorsal to the A. axillaris (branches to the muscular branches)
    - It passes together with the A. and V. profunda brachii through the triceps hiatus to the extensor side of the humerus and runs distally in the radial nerve groove (giving off the N. cutaneus brachii posterior, N. cutaneus brachii lateralis inferior)
    - It breaks through the lateral intermuscular septum of the arm and reaches the elbow in the radial tunnel (distribution of muscular branches, N. cutaneus antebrachii posterior)
    - Divides at the level of the radial head into the R. profundus and R. superficialis.
        - R. profundus n. radialis (motor branch)
            - Pulls distally in the supinator canal (delivery of muscular branches)
            - Only: R. interosseus antebrachii posterior
        - R. superficialis n. radial (sensory branch)
            - Runs covered from M. brachioradialis distally
            - Breaks through the fascia of the forearm on the extensor side
            - Divides above the wrist into the terminal branches dorsal digital nerves
- Important branches
    - Muscle fibers
    - Posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm
    - Inferior lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm
    - Posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm
    - R. profundus

    - M. supinator
    - M. abductor pollicis longus
    - M. extensor carpi ulnaris
    - M. extensor digiti minimi
    - M. extensor pollicis longus and brevis
    - M. extensor indicis

> [!NOTE] Nerve-radialis-paralysis  
> The radial nerve can be damaged at various levels along its course from the brachial plexus to the hand. It is particularly at risk, for example, in humeral shaft fractures, as it runs directly along the bone in the sulcus of the radial nerve. If it is injured proximally in the area of the axilla or the humerus, complete loss of all wrist and finger extensors occurs, resulting in the picture of the so-called “wrist drop.” Depending on the level of injury, the triceps brachii may also be affected, making extension at the elbow impossible. In addition, sensory disturbances occur in the innervation area of the radial nerve. In contrast, with distal lesions (supinator syndrome), only a partial paresis of the hand and finger musculature occurs with intact sensitivity.

### Smaller nerves of the brachial plexus

|Nerve|Course|Innervated Muscles|Sensory Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|
|N. musculocutaneus<br><br>C5–7, Lateral fascicle|- Exits at the level of the Coracoid process from the lateral fascicle<br>- Passes through the M. coracobrachialis, reaches between the M. biceps brachii and the M. brachialis<br>- Then becomes the sensory N. cutaneus antebrachii lateralis|- M. coracobrachialis<br>- M. biceps brachii<br>- M. brachialis|- Lateral side of the forearm to the thumb (N. cutaneus antebrachii lateralis)|

### Vascular-Nerve Pathways of the Forearm

The vessels and nerves of the arm usually run together in so-called vascular-nervous pathways.

- Radial vascular nerve pathway: A. and V. radialis, R. superficialis n. radialis
- Ulnar vascular nerve pathway: A. and V. ulnaris, N. ulnaris
- Medianusstraße: N. medianus

### Lymphatic Drainage

The lymph of the upper extremity flows through various intermediate stations to the axillary lymph nodes, which drain into the subclavian trunk.

- Shoulder: About the interconnected axillary lymph nodes in the subclavian trunk: lateral axillary lymph nodes → subscapular lymph nodes → central axillary lymph nodes → apical axillary lymph nodes (in the clavipectoral triangle)
- At the free upper extremity
    - Radial side: Directly into the lateral axillary lines
    - Ulnar side: Through the cubital nodes and brachial nodes to the lateral axillary nodes

> [!NOTE] Lymphangitis
> In the case of purulent inflammations on the hand, there can be a spread of the infection via the lymph (lymphangitis, commonly referred to as "blood poisoning"). This is manifested by a street-like redness of the skin with painful and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit.

### Development of the Extremities

The development of the limbs begins at the end of the fourth week in the limb field – a region in the right and left flank of the embryo. It lasts throughout the entire pregnancy and is not completed even after birth. The development of the limbs is only concluded with the completion of length growth through the closure of the so-called epiphyseal plates.

- 5th week: Beginning of the development of the limb skeleton
    - Visibility of the limb bud
    - In the anterior part of the ectoderm there is a thickened area – the marginal ridge
- 6th week: Visibility of the hand and foot plates and beginning of cartilage formation.
    - Fingers and toes: They form as the cells of the marginal zone divide into five segments through programmed cell death, which then grow further.
    - Cartilage nodules: Formed from a condensation in the mesenchyme
- 12th week: Beginning of enchondral ossification in all long tubular bones
    - Primary ossification centers
        - Located in the diaphyses of the long tubular bones
        - Ossification progresses in both directions.
- At birth
    - Diaphyses fully ossified
    - Beginning of the ossification of the epiphyses
        - Epiphyseal plates: Cartilage gap between the ossified diaphysis and the ossified epiphysis
            - Length growth of the tubular bones occurs from here
            - Ossification after the completion of longitudinal growth

> [!NOTE] Bone age
> The appearance of the various ossification centers can be detected during pregnancy via ultrasound and helps in determining the gestational age. The ossification centers can also be used to determine the bone age in children and adolescents. For this purpose, an X-ray of the hand is taken, on which the ossification centers are visible, allowing one to determine the "bone age." Normally, bone age corresponds with chronological age. However, in certain developmental disorders (e.g., precocious puberty, delayed puberty), they may differ.

> [!NOTE] Thalidomide Embryopathy
> During limb development, various malformations can occur – genetically or due to toxins – such as the absence of an arm (Amelie) or a hand (phocomelia). Normally, these malformations occur very rarely. However, in the late 1950s, there was an increased incidence of children being born with phocomelia worldwide. It was found that many of the mothers had taken thalidomide during pregnancy – a newly approved medication for anxiety and insomnia, which was considered safe for pregnant women at the time. Today, it is known that taking thalidomide in early pregnancy triggers a characteristic syndrome, the thalidomide embryopathy, which, in addition to the described limb malformations, can also lead to malformations of the intestines and the heart.

## Review Questions on the Chapter of Nerve Pathways of the Upper Extremity
### Arteries

Which anatomical structures are traversed by the radial and ulnar arteries as they transition from the forearm into the palm?
- The ulnar artery runs on the forearm in the ulnar vascular-nerve channel and, together with the ulnar nerve, passes through the Guyon’s canal into the palm. The radial artery runs parallel to the ulnar artery in the radial vascular-nerve channel, passes dorsally at the wrist, and then passes through the radial fovea (anatomical snuffbox) to reach the palm.
Between the tendons of which muscles in the forearm is the pulse of the radial artery easily palpable?
- The radial artery runs on the forearm between the tendons of the flexor carpi radialis muscle and the brachioradialis muscle. At this point, it is easily palpable.
### Brachial Plexus

What are the three parts of the infraclavicular part of the brachial plexus? From which parts do the axillary nerve, medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm, and musculocutaneous nerve each arise?
- The infraclavicular part of the brachial plexus is divided into three fascicles, named according to their position relative to the axillary artery: lateral, medial, and posterior fascicles. The musculocutaneous nerve arises from the lateral fascicle, the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm arises from the medial fascicle, and the axillary nerve originates from the posterior fascicle.
Which nerve innervates the M. serratus anterior?
- The serratus anterior muscle is the only muscle innervated by the long thoracic nerve.
What motor deficits can be expected with damage to the median nerve above the elbow?
- A lesion of the median nerve causes different patterns of damage depending on location. If the nerve is damaged in the upper arm or elbow region, there is weakness in forearm pronation, loss of thumb opposition, and loss of finger flexion of the thumb, index, and middle fingers. Since the flexors of the little and ring fingers are supplied by the ulnar nerve, the fist presents the characteristic “hand of benediction.” Over time, atrophy of the thenar muscles also occurs.
Describe the sensory innervation area of the median nerve!
- The median nerve provides sensory innervation to both dorsal and palmar parts of the hand. On the palmar side, it innervates the radial wrist, the radial part of the palm, the thenar region, and the radial three and a half fingers. Its dorsal innervation area includes the fingertips of the index and middle fingers and the fingertip on the radial side of the ring finger.
Which nerve passes through the medial intermuscular septum of the arm?
- The ulnar nerve initially runs on the flexor side of the upper arm in the medial bicipital groove and then pierces the medial intermuscular septum of the arm to reach the dorsal extensor side.
What causes a so-called "claw hand"?
- A “claw hand” describes the characteristic hand posture seen with ulnar nerve injury. A proximal lesion of the nerve (e.g., in the ulnar nerve groove) causes the loss of all interosseous muscles and lumbricals III and IV. During fist closure, this results in hyperextension of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.
Describe the origin as well as the sensitive innervation area of the N. ulnaris!
- The ulnar nerve arises from the medial fascicle of the brachial plexus and contains fibers from spinal segments C8 and T1. It provides sensory innervation to both palmar and dorsal parts of the hand. Palmar innervation covers the ulnar wrist, hypothenar region, ulnar palm, little finger, and the ulnar side of the ring finger. Its dorsal sensory area includes the ulnar hand dorsum, the ulnar base of the middle finger, the ring finger except for the radial side of the distal phalanx, and the little finger.
Which muscles are innervated by the ulnar nerve?
- The ulnar nerve innervates the ulnar portion of the wrist flexors (flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus for fingers III, IV, and V), the adductor pollicis muscle, the deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis, most of the intrinsic hand muscles (palmar and dorsal interossei, lumbricals III and IV), and all hypothenar muscles (abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, opponens digiti minimi, palmaris brevis).
What symptoms does a proximal injury of the radial nerve cause?
- The radial nerve can be injured at different levels from the brachial plexus to the hand. If damaged proximally in the axilla or humerus region, there is a complete loss of all wrist and finger extensors, resulting in the so-called “wrist drop.” Depending on the injury level, the triceps brachii may also be affected, making elbow extension impossible. Sensory disturbances occur in the radial nerve's innervation area.
Describe the course of the N. radialis and its R. profundus!
- The radial nerve arises from the posterior fascicle of the brachial plexus and lies dorsal to the axillary artery. It initially runs on the extensor side of the upper arm in the radial nerve groove, then pierces the lateral intermuscular septum and reaches the cubital fossa in the radial tunnel. At the level of the radial head, it divides into its terminal branches: the motor deep branch pierces the supinator muscle and runs distally, giving off muscular branches, and terminates in the forearm as the posterior interosseous nerve.
Describe the origin and course of the N. musculocutaneus as well as its motor and sensory innervation area!
- The musculocutaneous nerve arises at the level of the coracoid process from the lateral fascicle of the brachial plexus (C5–C7). It passes through the coracobrachialis muscle and runs between the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles; all three muscles are innervated by it. It finally ends as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, which supplies the radial flexor side of the forearm up to the thumb.
Which nerve injury is most likely with a humeral shaft fracture? Describe possible symptoms of impairment!
- A humeral shaft fracture poses a risk of injury to the axillary nerve, which runs directly around the surgical neck of the humerus (a predilection site for fractures). It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles; therefore, a lesion mainly restricts shoulder abduction. Additionally, there is sensory loss of the skin over the shoulder region.
### Lymph Drainage

The lymph of the upper extremity flows through various intermediate stations to the apical axillary lymph nodes. Where is this group of lymph nodes located and into which vessel does it direct the lymph?
- The apical axillary lymph nodes are a group of lymph nodes located in the so-called clavipectoral triangle, which collect the lymph of the upper limb and channel it into the subclavian trunk.
