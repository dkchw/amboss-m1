# Patient Care and Healthcare System
## Summary

Physicians care for a wide variety of patients throughout their professional lives. It is important to consider the patient's perspective, which usually lacks medical education, in order to treat with the best possible satisfaction. Patients go through various stages of outpatient and inpatient care from the first sensation of a symptom to medical care. This section addresses these stages, as well as important basic principles of the German healthcare system.

## Stages of Seeking Help

From the first notice of a symptom to the seeking of professional help, patients go through various stages:

1. Symptom perception
2. Seeking Help in the Layperson System
3. Utilization of Professional Help
4. Seeking help in alternative medical offerings

### Symptomwahrnehmung (Symptom perception)

The decision to seek medical help for a particular symptom is influenced by various factors. In the area of symptom perception, the following terms should be assigned:

- Increased symptom attention due to:
    - Severe pain
    - Visible symptomatology
    - Recurrent symptom or persistence over a long period
    - Felt threat from the illness
    - Anxious mood
    - Expected restrictions due to the sick role do not conflict with the current life situation
- Lay etiology: Considerations by affected persons about causes and possible treatment approaches for their symptoms as part of their so-called subjective illness theory, possibly making their own diagnosis
- Possible reactions to the perceived symptom
    - Devaluation of the symptom
        - Trivialization: Downplaying the complaints – "It doesn't bother me at all!"
        - Denial: Defense mechanism – "I don't notice anything at all!"
    - Decision to self-treat: Self-medication with over-the-counter drugs or remaining medications from previous illnesses, use of home remedies, etc.
    - Seeking help in the lay system
    - Utilization of professional help

### Hilfesuche im Laiensystem (Seeking Help in the Layperson System)

If affected persons perceive a symptom, analyze it with lay etiology and classify it as serious, they can first seek further information and help in the so-called layperson system.

- Layperson system: Non-medical environment such as partner, family members, acquaintances
- Function: If the environment has an aversion to doctors, an initial referral to other levels of the layperson system can follow; in the next step, affected persons turn to the medical care system

### Inanspruchnahme professioneller Hilfe (Utilization of Professional Help)

When utilizing professional help (visiting a doctor), affected persons leave the layperson system and become patients. Various factors increase the likelihood that affected persons decide to seek medical help:

- Subjectively poor health condition
- Secured or perceived secured financing of the doctor’s visit
- Good accessibility of doctors
- Positive attitude towards the health system, possibly due to positive experiences

### Hilfesuche in alternativen medizinischen Angeboten (Seeking help in alternative medical offerings)

Due to worldview, distrust in conventional medicine or bad experiences in the past, affected persons may decide to make use of alternative healing methods.

- Alternative healing methods: Healing methods developed outside the scientifically oriented "conventional medicine," e.g., homeopathy, acupuncture, herbal medicine, Ayurveda
- Complementary healing methods: Use of alternative healing methods as a supplement to conventional medical measures
## Demand, Need and Care

To understand the connections between demand, need and care within the healthcare system, it is important to know the meaning of some terms in the medical context.

### Definitions

- Demand: Subjective well-being of affected persons and desire for medical care
- Need: Actual (objective) presence of a disease or functional impairment that makes medical care necessary
- Care: Available medical supply
    - Needs-based care: Sufficient care options exist both from the perspective of the affected person (subjective) and from the doctor’s (objective) perspective
    - Undersupply: Demand and need exceed the supply of care, especially in Germany with regard to mental and chronic diseases
    - Oversupply: Care supply exceeds demand and need (e.g., imaging for back pain without warning signs)

#### Discrepancy between demand and need

The terms "under-utilization" and "over-utilization" denote the difference between need and demand.

- "Under-utilization": lack of demand despite objective need
- "Over-utilization": demand despite lacking objective need

> [!NOTE] Hypochondriacal Disorder  
> Persons with hypochondriacal disorder suffer from great fear of having a particular threatening illness (usually of an organ system) without actually being affected by it. They sometimes experience the corresponding symptoms in a delusional manner. Numerous doctor visits may be the consequence ("Big File Patient"), also because negative findings are not believed. In such a case, this is considered "over-utilization". Also, symptom attention (see above) is strongly increased in persons with hypochondriacal disorder because the body and condition are examined for the expected symptoms (so-called "checking behaviour").

#### Increase in demand

An increase in demand is often induced by supply:

- Doctor supply: An increased density of doctors in a region increases demand for medical care
- Supply-induced demand: Physicians generate needs for a particular medical service in patients through offerings, e.g., for financial interests
    - Health insurance companies can reduce resulting oversupply, for example, through:
        - Restrictions on drug budgets
        - Payment of premiums for insured persons who have not used medical services in a certain period

### Fehlversorgung (Misprovision)

Misprovision can happen in various ways. Two (exam-relevant) phenomena fall under this:

- Medicalization: Phenomena of normal life enter the medical domain by being considered disorders
- Medical decision rules: As precise as possible judgments on diagnosis and therapy. The following errors should be avoided.
    - Type 1 error: Making a "false-positive" diagnosis → leads to further, possibly health-damaging and cost-causing examinations and therapies
    - Type 2 error: Making a "false-negative" diagnosis → possibly delayed or inefficient therapy
## Patient care in the primary physician system

The search for professional help marks the beginning of the "patient career," during which various stages of the healthcare system are passed through. Ideally, the patient career should begin with the so-called primary physician. From there, more targeted care and treatment by specialists can be coordinated.

### Primary care

- Primary physician: Provides basic care and is the first point of contact (e.g., general practitioners, gynecologists or pediatricians)
- Function: Examination of patients and assessment of the situation, then:
    - Treatment or
    - Referral to resident specialists (secondary care) or
    - Admission to the hospital (tertiary care)
- Goal: All information converges at one person

### Secondary care by specialists

- Secondary physician: Resident specialists or outpatient clinic/polyclinic of a larger hospital
- Basis: Primary and secondary physicians are urgently needed for optimal care, otherwise risk:
    - Undersupply (e.g., due to loss of information)
    - Oversupply (e.g., due to duplication of examinations)

### Interface problem with chronically ill patients

The increasing number of chronically ill persons poses some difficulties for care and the affected persons themselves:

- Many involved care units (primary doctors, specialists, inpatient care, physiotherapy, nursing, etc.), resulting in:
    - Difficult communication
    - Patients do not know which concern belongs where
    - Patients must repeatedly present information (e.g., medical history) → information losses
        - Close cooperation between care units
        - Timely documentation (doctor letters, etc.)
- Care by relatives:
    - Nearly three quarters of chronically care-dependent persons are cared for at home by their relatives
    - About a quarter are supported by outpatient care services
    - About half of the care-dependent persons are cared for entirely alone by their relatives
## Healthcare System in Germany

Due to the occurrence of diseases, certain social functions (e.g., practicing a profession) can no longer be performed. The healthcare system legally secures continued care in case of illness and is governed by various principles.

### Overview of healthcare systems

- Social insurance system (Bismarck model): System applicable in Germany, according to which statutory health insurance finances health services. Public and private providers (hospitals, physicians) are responsible for delivering these services.
- State health service (Beveridge model): System applicable in Great Britain, where the state finances public care institutions through tax revenues. Treatment is free of charge for all citizens.
- Market-oriented system: In this system, the majority of medical care is financed privately and there is no insurance obligation.
- Semashko model: Centrally planned, hierarchically organized system with full state control, which existed in socialist states of the 20th century and was supposed to enable free access to healthcare for all citizens (no longer existing). Financing was through general taxes.

> [!NOTE]
> The statutory social insurance in Germany includes, besides the statutory health insurance (GKV), also the accident, pension, unemployment, and the nursing care insurance introduced last in 1995!

### Basics of the German healthcare system

Health insurance in Germany is compulsory. This ensures that the sick do not suffer economic disadvantages during incapacity to work. About 90% of citizens are insured by statutory health insurance, the remaining 10% privately.

#### Health insurance

In Germany, all citizens are obliged to enter a health insurance (compulsory insurance). Depending on income, there is a choice between statutory and private health insurance. Statutory health insurance (GKV) is part of social insurance (alongside accident, pension, nursing care, and unemployment insurance) and regulates medical care according to the solidarity principle. Insured persons receive the right to medical care through their contribution, whereby the benefits of the health insurance depend on individual need. All insured persons thus receive equal access to medical services. In private health insurance, the contribution level is not based on the solidarity principle as with the GKV, but on the equivalence principle. The payment of treatment costs is also regulated differently here (reimbursement principle).

- Types of insurance
    1. Statutory Health Insurance (GKV): 90% of all insured persons are statutorily insured. The GKV is based on the following principles:
        - Solidarity principle
            - The contribution rate for statutory health insurance funds is income-dependent and currently amounts to 14.6% (or reduced 14.0%) of gross income
            - Part of this principle is the contribution-free co-insurance of own children in statutory health insurance (so-called family insurance)
            - Benefits depend on need
        - Parity principle: The contribution is paid 50% each by
            - Employer or pension insurance
            - Employee or pensioner
        - Benefit-in-kind principle: Services are provided to the insured (i.e., the patients) by the GKV in the form of services for medical treatment, i.e., without direct financial transaction (in contrast to reimbursement, where expenses are reimbursed to the insured)
        - Principle of free choice of insurance fund: Since 01.01.1996, statutory insured persons can freely choose from almost all health insurance funds
            - Increased competition pressure among health insurance funds should increase efficiency and service for the insured → improvement of medical services
        - Pay-as-you-go financing: Current expenditures of health insurances (as well as other branches of social insurance) are covered by current income
        - Risk structure compensation: Financial compensation via the so-called health fund among health insurance funds to compensate for differences regarding the health risks of the insured.
    2. Private Health Insurance (PKV): 10% of all insured persons are privately insured. The PKV is based on the following principles:
        - Equivalence principle: Contribution amount is measured equivalent to individual risk and desired service spectrum
        - Reimbursement principle: After an outpatient doctor visit, insured persons initially pay the bill and are subsequently reimbursed by the private health insurance
        - Individual insurance principle: A separate contribution must be paid for each insured person (no family insurance)

> [!NOTE]
> In Germany, all citizens must have health insurance (compulsory insurance)!

> [!NOTE]
> Solidarity principle: All statutory insured persons have the same claim to benefits regardless of contributions paid!

> [!NOTE]
> The Joint Federal Committee (G-BA) decides as the highest self-governing body in the German healthcare system on many questions of health care within statutory health insurance. It is formed by the 4 major self-governing organizations in the healthcare system: National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV), National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Dentists (KZBV), German Hospital Federation (DKG), and National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds (GKV-SV).

#### Separation into outpatient and inpatient sectors

- Outpatient care: About ⅓ of physicians are resident (as of 2015)
    - Contracted physicians
        - Have approval from the regional association of statutory health insurance physicians (KV) to care for statutory insured persons
        - The majority of resident doctors are contracted physicians, as 90% of citizens are statutorily insured
    - Private practices: For privately insured and self-paying persons
- Inpatient care: Hospitals

#### Right to free choice of doctor

- Principle: Statutorily insured persons can choose their physicians themselves, provided they are contracted physicians
    - Advantage: Great patient freedom
    - Disadvantage: Good cooperation between involved physicians required

#### Incapacity to work

Incapacity to work exists when the working person cannot temporarily perform their activity due to illness or endangers their own health by continuing to work.

- Certification: By medical sick note
- Continued payment of wages law: Secures continued payment
    - The employer pays the normal salary for the first six weeks after the sick note
    - GKV: Subsequently, the statutorily insured person receives sick pay from the health insurance
    - PKV: Depending on agreements with the conclusion of a so-called daily sickness allowance insurance

#### Patient rights

Patient rights were first summarized and anchored in the German Civil Code by the Patient Rights Act, which came into force in 2013. The aim of the Patient Rights Act is to strengthen the position of patients vis-à-vis service providers and health insurance companies.

- Goals of the Patient Rights Act
    - Strengthened procedural rights in case of treatment errors
    - Strengthened rights vis-à-vis service providers
    - Better information for patients

### Statutory Health Insurance Physicians' Association

The Statutory Health Insurance Physicians' Association (KV) ensures outpatient care for statutorily insured persons. The tasks of the KV should not be confused with those of the medical chambers, which represent the entire medical profession. The tasks of both institutions are compared below. For further information on medical chambers see: Relationship between physicians and patients.

- Brief description: Administrative body of all physicians and psychotherapists who are authorized to ambulatory treatment of patients of statutory health insurance. Their authorization is also issued by the Statutory Health Insurance Physicians' Association.
- Administrative structure: The statutory health insurance physicians' associations are subordinate to the state health ministries and are legal corporations under public law

### Changes in care models

In recent years, the influence of health insurance companies has increased due to changes by the legislature. Some important new care models are introduced below.

- Disease Management Programs
    - Definition: Structured treatment programs by health insurance companies for chronically ill (e.g., diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma)
    - Goal: Better treatment outcomes through guideline-based therapy and increased therapy adherence
    - For detailed information see: Disease Management Programs
- Integrated Care
    - Definition: Interdisciplinary networking of various service providers who cooperate and exchange information
    - Goals
        - Better nationwide coverage
        - Better coordination of treatment of individual patients
    - Characteristics
        - Participants receive a bonus from their health insurance depending on the insurance company
        - Selective contract: Direct contracts between service providers and health insurers as payers
- Medical Care Centers
    - Definition: Spatial association of various contracted physicians and other therapists
    - Goal
        - Better networking of outpatient care and shortening of distances
        - Facilitation of integrated care
- Family Doctor Models
    - Definition: In this model, a visit to a specialist practice is possible only after referral by general practitioners
    - Goal: Better coordination of specialist visits
    - Characteristics: Participants receive a financial bonus from their health insurance depending on the insurance company
- Day-care or partial inpatient treatment forms
    - Allow more intensive treatment compared to purely outpatient care
    - Save costs compared to fully inpatient treatment

### Development of hospital landscape

Several parameters of hospital utilization have changed significantly in the last 20 years. Some of these changes are partly due to political measures such as the introduction of DRG flat rates in 2004. This measure was intended to increase the efficiency of hospital treatments by reimbursing cases by lump sums regardless of length of hospital stay.

- Decrease in length of stay in hospital by about 50% since 1991
- Decrease in number of beds
- Increase in case numbers

### Understanding health professions as service professions

Health professions – and thus also the medical profession – are service professions in which services are provided to an individual or to society in general.

- § 1 of the German Medical Code: "The physician serves the health of the individual and the entire people."
- Healthcare has developed into a major economic and service sector.
    - Over 90% of Germans are statutorily insured and thus entitled to use healthcare services.
    - 12% of employed Germans work in healthcare (as of 2011).
- IGeL (Individual health services)
    - Additional service offerings
    - May be offered by contracted physicians
    - Costs are not covered by health insurance but must be borne personally
    - E.g., additional preventive examinations, travel medicine counseling

### Remuneration in the healthcare system

Utilizing the healthcare system generates both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are billed using DRGs, i.e., patients are assigned to a certain DRG linked to a fixed rate.

#### Direct vs. indirect healthcare costs

- Indirect healthcare costs: Costs incurred due to services not performed by a sick working person (loss of productivity)
- Direct healthcare costs: Costs incurred due to utilization of a medical service
    - Currently rising annually for various reasons (e.g., demographic change, expensive treatment methods, etc.)
- Types of services with the highest expenditure (descending)
    1. Nursing/therapeutic services
    2. Goods
    3. Medical services

#### Remuneration systems

Using remuneration systems, medical services are billed to health insurance companies.

- Hospital: Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG)
    - Mandatory since 2004 for billing hospitals to health insurance companies
    - Billing services based on diagnosis-related case groups/lump sums, no longer by daily rates.
    - Since introduction: significantly shorter length of hospital stay
- Outpatient sector

    - Statutorily insured: Billing according to the "Uniform Value Scale" (EBM)

    - Private patients: Billing according to the "Medical Fee Schedule" (GOÄ)


### Healthcare expenditures

Healthcare expenditures are divided according to payers, institutions, and types of services. The highest costs arise respectively at:

- Healthcare expenditures by payer: Statutory health insurance
- Healthcare expenditures by institutions
    - Outpatient: Medical practices and pharmacies
    - (Partial) inpatient: Hospitals
- Healthcare expenditures by types of services: Nursing/therapeutic services
## Quality management in the healthcare system

Ensuring quality in medical care is of enormous importance, especially considering cuts in financial resources in healthcare. The Medical Center for Quality in Medicine has defined the quality concept in healthcare as follows:

- Quality concept in healthcare: "Quality in healthcare means sufficient and appropriate, i.e., patient- and needs-oriented, quality-of-life-oriented, professionally qualified, but also economical medical care with the aim of increasing the probability of desired treatment outcomes in individuals and in the overall population." (Medical Center for Quality in Medicine)

### Structure, process and outcome quality

To assess quality in the healthcare system, three different quality dimensions are considered in the evaluation. These are listed below with exemplary parameters.

1. Structure quality: Framework conditions for medical care
    - Number of general practitioners in a region
    - Equipment with rooms and devices
    - Number and qualification of personnel in a clinic
    - Number of beds on a ward
2. Process quality: Evaluation of the procedures within
    - Therapy
    - Care
    - Diagnostics
    - Less easily measurable parameters
3. Outcome quality: Evaluation of the extent to which goals of medical care were achieved, e.g., in the following parameters
    - Objective parameters
        - Mortality and lethality rates
        - Number of nosocomial infections
        - Average length of stay in a clinic
    - Subjective parameters
        - Patient satisfaction (see below)
        - Quality of life after treatment

### Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)

EBM is a concept whose goal is medical treatment based on scientifically supported knowledge. EBM demands have now become standard.

- Definition of evidence-based medicine: "Evidence-based medicine (EbM = evidence-supported medicine) is thus the conscientious, explicit and reasonable use of the current best external, scientific evidence for decisions in the medical care of individual patients." (German Network for Evidence-Based Medicine)
- Ideal EBM process
    1. Formulation of a specific clinical question
    2. Systematic search for evidence to answer the question in medical literature
    3. Critical evaluation of the validity of the evidence
    4. Assessment of the observed effect
    5. Application of the evidence to the patients
    6. Self-evaluation
- Terms for evaluating medical measures:
    - Effectiveness: Effectiveness under routine care conditions
    - Efficacy: Effectiveness under ideal conditions
- Evidence classes: Classification of medical knowledge according to their evidence

|Class|   |Evidence|
|---|---|---|
|I|Ia|Evidence based on at least one systematic review (meta-analysis) of randomized controlled trials|
|Ib|Evidence based on at least one randomized controlled trial of high quality|
|II|IIa|Evidence based on at least one non-randomized controlled trial of high quality|
|IIb|Evidence based on at least one quasi-experimental study or cohort study|
|III|   |Evidence based on descriptive studies|
|IV|   |Evidence based on expert opinions, experiences and reports|

### Quality assurance

Several measures are available for quality assurance.

- Peer reviews: Evaluation of a scientific work by independent colleagues of the same field
- Second opinions: Opinions from other experts
- Supervision: Performance control by trainers ("supervisor") with presentation and discussion of current cases
- Quality circles: Discussion of problems and search for solutions with colleagues in the sense of internal quality control
## Review questions on the chapter Patient Care and Healthcare System

### Demand, Need and Care

What is meant by supply-induced demand?
- The demand, i.e. the subjective desire for this care, is increased by the offer of certain services (e.g., when a practice acquires a new device).
When does oversupply occur?
- Oversupply occurs when the supply of services exceeds demand and need, e.g., imaging (e.g., MRI, CT) for back pain without warning signs.
### Patient care in the primary physician system

What is the function of primary physicians in the German healthcare system?
- Primary physicians (e.g., general practitioners) ensure basic medical care and should be the first point of contact for patients and, if necessary, refer them to resident specialists (secondary care) or to hospital (tertiary care).
Who mainly cares for the chronically care-dependent in Germany?
- In Germany, chronically care-dependent persons are mainly, namely in about three quarters of cases, cared for by their relatives.
### Healthcare system in Germany

According to which model is the statutory health insurance in Germany organized and who is it named after?
- The statutory health insurance in Germany is a social insurance system according to a model introduced by Otto von Bismarck (Bismarck model). It finances itself through income-related contributions shared between the employed person and the employer. The Beveridge model (state health service) applicable in Great Britain finances care institutions through taxes. In this model, health services are free for all citizens.
How was the Semashko model financed?
- The Semashko model of former Eastern bloc countries was a centrally administered, tax-funded care system that no longer exists in its original form today.
On which six important principles is the statutory health insurance (GKV) in Germany based?
- The GKV is based on the principles of solidarity, parity, benefit-in-kind, free choice of insurance fund, pay-as-you-go financing, and risk structure compensation. All insured persons have the same entitlement to benefits regardless of their paid contributions.
What is regulated by the parity principle?
- According to the parity principle, the contribution to the statutory health insurance (GKV) is calculated based on income (currently 14.6%, as of 2018) and is paid 50% each by the employed person and employer or the pension insurance.
What is meant by the solidarity principle as opposed to the equivalence principle?
- According to the solidarity principle of the GKV, contributions are calculated based on the income of the insured, while in the private health insurance’s equivalence principle, individual risk and desired service spectrum determine the contribution amount.
How does the benefit-in-kind principle differ from the reimbursement principle? Which insurance type applies them?
- Under the benefit-in-kind principle of the GKV, services are provided directly to the insured without upfront payment. In contrast, in the private health insurance’s reimbursement principle, insured persons pay the bill after an outpatient doctor visit and are reimbursed afterward.
Why was the principle of free choice of insurance fund introduced in Germany?
- Statutorily insured persons are allowed to largely choose their health insurance fund themselves. This increased competition between health insurers is meant to improve their efficiency and quality.
What proportion of doctors in Germany work as residents?
- About one third of doctors in Germany work as contracted physicians or in private practices.
What are the tasks of the statutory health insurance physicians' associations?
- The statutory health insurance physicians' associations are responsible for ensuring outpatient medical care for the statutorily insured (supply assurance). They also negotiate contracts with health insurers, distribute total remuneration to the physicians, organize treatment standards, perform quality assurance tasks and review the cost-effectiveness of patient care.
What are the tasks of the medical chambers?
- The concept of “integrated care” is based on networking of outpatient, inpatient and other service providers to optimize the care pathway through cooperation and exchange. This should lead to better patient navigation and overall cost savings.
What are disease management programs? Why were they introduced?
- To improve treatment outcomes of chronically ill patients, health insurers have developed structured treatment programs called disease management programs (e.g., for diabetes mellitus or bronchial asthma).
What is the principle behind "integrated care" and what is it supposed to achieve?
- The concept of “integrated care” is based on networking of outpatient, inpatient and other service providers who cooperate and exchange in order to optimize the care chain. This should better guide patients through the healthcare system and save costs overall.
What is the difference between a medical care center and a group practice?
- A medical care center is an association of contracted physicians from different specialties for well-networked outpatient care. The difference to a group practice is that patients do not conclude a direct treatment contract with the doctor but with the medical care center.
What is the purpose of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs)?
- DRGs were introduced in 2004 for billing between health insurers and hospitals. Services are reimbursed according to diagnosis-related lump sums (instead of previous daily rates), which has led to a significantly shorter length of hospital stay since their introduction.
### Quality management in the healthcare system

What is structure quality? How is it measured?
- Structure quality represents the framework conditions of medical care. Structure features are recorded, such as equipment with technical devices, number and qualifications of personnel, or the number of beds in a ward.
How is process quality assessed?
- Process quality assesses procedures (processes), e.g., in therapy, care, or diagnostics.
Which parameters are used to assess outcome quality?
- Outcome quality assesses the extent to which goals of medical care are achieved. Objective parameters can be mortality and lethality rates or number of nosocomial infections, as well as subjective parameters such as patient satisfaction or quality of life after treatment.
What is the concept of evidence-based medicine (EBM)?
- EBM uses the current best scientific knowledge as a basis for decision-making in medical care in a conscientious and reasonable manner.
Which study type has evidence grade Ia?
- Ia is the highest evidence class and is based on meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.
What is the difference between efficacy and effectiveness?
- Efficacy reflects the effectiveness of a medical measure under ideal conditions, while effectiveness evaluates effectiveness under routine care.
What is meant by peer reviews?
- Peer reviews are quality assurance measures in which treatment processes and results are evaluated by medical colleagues ("peers") for possible quality deficiencies. For example, quality of articles in medical journals is assured this way: only after multiple colleagues have reviewed and approved a paper it is published.
What is meant by a quality circle?
- In a quality circle, colleagues or clinic staff meet for internal quality control, discuss problems and look for solutions.
