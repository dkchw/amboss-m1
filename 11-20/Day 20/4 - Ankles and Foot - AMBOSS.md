# Ankles and Foot
## Summary

With the emergence of upright walking (bipedalism), the hand could develop into a pure grasping organ, while the foot became a pure supporting organ. During this evolutionary restructuring, the foot skeleton changed in characteristic ways: the toes became shorter compared to the finger bones, while the tarsal bones were massively strengthened to support the full body weight. Accordingly, extensive movement of the foot occurs only in the toes and the two ankle joints. In the upper ankle joint, flexion (plantarflexion) and extension (dorsiflexion) of the foot occur, while in the lower ankle joint, pronation (also known as eversion) and supination (also known as inversion) take place.

All other joints of the foot are connected by a tight ligamentous apparatus to the so-called arch of the foot, which serves to cushion the forces exerted on the foot when walking and jumping. The foot muscles are divided into a weaker dorsal foot muscle group and a stronger plantar muscle group. Unlike the muscles of other body regions, the muscles of the sole of the foot have little dynamic function but a significant static function, as they continuously counteract the flattening of the foot arch under load.
## Bones

The foot skeleton can be divided into three sections from proximal to distal. The classification of the foot may differ from the anatomical classification in the clinic and can sometimes be inconsistent. In this context, a division into forefoot and hindfoot, with the Lisfranc joint as the boundary, is often common.

1. Tarsus (= Tarsus)
2. Metatarsus (= Metatarsus)
3. Antetarsus (= Forefoot)

### Tarsus (= Ankle)

The tarsus consists of seven bones arranged in two rows: The three largest tarsal bones form a proximal row (proximal tarsus) and four additional bones create a distal row (distal tarsus).

#### Proximal Tarsus

The proximal row of the tarsus consists, from proximal to distal, of the talus, calcaneus, and navicular bone. The three bones form, together with the malleolar fork, the ankle joints.

##### Talus (= Ankle bone)

The jumping leg can be divided from proximal to distal into the following sections:

- Tali corpus
    - Trochlea tali (= trochlea of the talus) (cranially): Articulates with the malleolar fork in the upper ankle joint
    - Articular surface of the posterior calcaneus (plantar-posterior): Articulates with the posterior part of the calcaneus
    - Articular surface of the middle calcaneus (plantar-ant.): Articulates with the middle part of the calcaneus
    - Sulcus tali (plantar)
        - Tarsal canal: Course of the Interosseous talocalcaneal ligament
- Collum tali (= Talus neck)
    - Articular facet of the anterior calcaneus (plantar): Articulates with the anterior portion of the calcaneus
- Head of the talus (= Talus Head)
    - Articular facet of the navicular (ventral): Articulates with the navicular bone in the lower ankle joint

##### Calcaneus (= Heel bone)

The calcaneus is the largest bone in the foot. It articulates cranially with the talus and ventrally with the cuboid bone. It has two important sections:

- Calcaneal tuber
    - Thickened dorsal part of the calcaneus: Forms the dorsal standing surface of the foot when standing
    - Approach for the Achilles tendon
- Sustentaculum tali
    - Medial bone process
    - Upper surface: Articular surface to Talus
    - Subpage: Groove for M. flexor hallucis longus

##### The navicular bone (= scaphoid bone)

- Disc-shaped bone
- Articular surfaces
    - Proximal: To the Caput tali
    - Distal: To the three cuneiform bones

#### Distal Tarsus

The distal row of the tarsal bones consists medially of the three cuneiform bones and laterally of the cuboid bone.

- Cuneiform bones (= Cuneiform bones): Medial cuneiform bone, intermediate, lateral
    - Articular surfaces: Form joints with each other (cuneiform bones laterally also with the cuboid bone)
        - Proximal: To the navicular bone
        - Distal: To the metatarsal bones I–III
    - Form
        - Wedge-shaped: Significant for the transverse arch of the foot
- The cuboid bone (=Würfelbein)
    - Articular surfaces
        - Proximal: To the Calcaneus
        - Medial: To the navicular bone and lateral cuneiform bone
        - Distal: Metatarsal bones IV–V
    - Subpage: Groove for M. fibularis longus

> [!NOTE]
> With this sentence, you can better remember the names and sequence of the tarsal bones: "The talus and the calcaneus, they want to go into the navicular and get three wedges from the cuboid!“

> [!NOTE]
> In the skeleton, there is a "scaphoid bone" both in the hand and in the foot! In the hand, it is referred to as “os scaphoideum,” while in the foot, it is called “os naviculare!

### Metatarsus (= Metatarsal)

The five metatarsal bones (= Ossa metatarsalia I–V) can each be divided into three sections from proximal to distal.

- Base of the metatarsal: Articulates with the tarsal bones (I–III with the cuneiform bones, IV and V with the cuboid bone)
- Body of the metatarsal: Long elongated bone body
- Head of the metatarsal: Articulates with the forefoot bones (toes I–V)

Similar to the hand, there is a medial and a lateral sesamoid bone (= sesamoid) on the plantar side of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux, to which tendons insert.

- Medial sesamoid bone: M. abductor hallucis, medial head of the M. flexor hallucis brevis
- Lateral Sesambein: M. adductor hallucis, Lateral head of the M. flexor hallucis brevis

### Antetarsus (= Forefoot)

The forefoot consists of the five toes (= Digiti pedis). The big toe (= Hallux) consists of two, while the other toes each consist of three toe bones (= Ossa digitorum pedis, phalanges):

- Phalanx proximalis (= proximal phalanx): Longest toe bone
- Phalanx media (= middle phalanx): Missing on the Hallux (1. Toe)
- Phalanx distal (= Distal phalanx)

> [!NOTE]
> In the thumb of the hand and the big toe of the foot, the phalange media is missing. They each consist only of the proximal phalanx and the distal phalanx!

> [!NOTE] Hallux valgus  
> By wearing unsuitable footwear (too tight or too high shoes), genetically predisposed conditions, or as part of rheumatic diseases, toe deformities can occur. The most common is the so-called hallux valgus: This involves a deviation of the big toe (hallux) at the metatarsophalangeal joint laterally (valgus position), while the metatarsal bone of the first ray points medially. The resulting non-physiological lever arm of the extensor hallucis longus muscle causes the big toe to be pressed over or under the second toe. Typical symptoms include pain in the metatarsophalangeal joint and inflammation in the area of the medial bulge. Therapeutically, surgery may be necessary.

## Ankles

The two ankles are the main joints of the foot. The upper and lower ankle are distinguished. The upper ankle forms the connection between the lower leg and the tarsus, the lower ankle is a connection of the tarsal bones to each other.

### Ankle Joint (Articulatio talocruralis, AJ)

- Definition: The talocrural joint is the proximal of the ankle joints and connects the malleolar fork with the talus (= Talus)
- Function: Plantarflexion/Dorsiflexion (1 degree of freedom around the transverse axis)
- Joint Type: Hinge Joint
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Gelenkkopf: Trochlea tali
        - Socket: Malleolar fork
    - Soft tissue
        - Joint capsule
            - Begins proximally at the edges of the cartilaginous joint surfaces and ends distally only at the collum tali
            - Fused ventrally with extensor tendons (prevents the entrapment of the capsule during dorsal extension of the foot)
        - Bands
            - Cranial: Syndesmosis tibiofibularis of the malleolar fork
            - Medial
                - Deltoid ligament (= medial ligament): Consists of 4 bundles that run between the tibia (medial malleolus) and the foot and function as the medial collateral ligament.
                    - Anterior tibiotalar part and Posterior tibiotalar part
                    - Tibionavicular part
                    - Tibiocalcaneal part
            - Lateral: Three ligaments that run between the fibula (lateral malleolus) and the foot and function as lateral collateral ligaments.
                - The lateral collateral ligaments prevent the foot from bending inward (supination)
                - Anterior talofibular ligament and posterior talofibular ligament
                - Calcaneofibular ligament

> [!NOTE] OSG-Distorsion (“Sprain”)
> A typical sports injury is an ankle sprain with lateral ankle ligament injury and ligament injury (“sprained ankle”), which often occurs due to twisting over the outer ankle. Such a supination trauma can cause the lateral ligaments to tear, often affecting the anterior talofibular ligament. Sports injuries are initially treated according to the PECH rule: Pause – Ice – Compression – Elevation. The further therapy (provided a fracture has been ruled out) usually consists of immobilization of the ankle joint for at least five weeks. During the course, there may be swelling and bruising over the ankle.

### Ankle Joint (Articulatio talotarsalis, ATJ)

- Definition: The lower ankle joint is the distal of the ankle joints and connects the talus, calcaneus, and navicular bone together.
- Outline: Divided into two anatomically independent joints by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament
    - Anterior chamber (= Art. talocalcaneonavicularis)
    - Posterior chamber (= subtalar joint)
- Function: Pronation (= Eversion)/Supination (= Inversion), 1 degree of freedom around an approximately sagittal axis
- Joint Type: Ball Joint

| The two chambers of the subtalar joint (STJ)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Joints of the Foot

In addition to the ankle joints, there are numerous other joints in the foot, which can be categorized as follows:

1. Adjacent joints of the tarsus
2. Metatarsophalangeal joints
    - Ankle-Midfoot Joints (= Tarsometatarsal Joints)
    - Joints between the metatarsal bones (= intermetatarsal joints)
3. Zehengelenke
    - Zehengrundgelenke (= Metatarsophalangeal joints)
    - Toe joints and toe end joints (= interphalangeal joints)

### Adjacent joints of the tarsus

In addition to the ankle joints, there are other joints in the tarsus: the so-called Chopart joint as well as the small foot joints between the navicular bone and the distal row of tarsal bones.

#### Chopart Joint (Articulatio tarsi transversa)

- Definition: Functional unit made up of two individual joints that together form an s-shaped joint gap (Chopart's joint line)
    - Calcaneocuboid joint
    - Art. talocalcaneonavicularis
- Function
    - Strengthening of supination (= inversion) of the ankle joint
    - Damping/Adjustment Movements
- Joint Type: Amphiarthrosis
- Involved Structures
    - Bones: Talus, Calcaneus, Navicular bone, Cuboid bone
    - Soft tissue: Firmly fixed by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments.

#### Small Tarsal Joints

- Definition: Stiff joints of the tarsal bones, located between Chopart's joint line and Lisfranc's joint line.
- Function
    - Lesser contribution to pronation and supination of the foot
    - Participation in the transverse arch of the foot
- Joint type: Amphiarthroses
- Involved Structures
    - Bones: Navicular bone, Cuneiform bones, Cuboid bone
    - Soft tissue: Firmly fixed by dorsal, plantar, and interosseous ligaments.

### Metatarsophalangeal Joints

There are two joint types in the midfoot, which are all relatively immovable amphiarthroses: on the one hand, the joints between the tarsal bones and the midfoot (tarsometatarsal joints), and on the other hand, the joints that form between the metatarsal bones (intermetatarsal joints).

#### Ankle-Midfoot Joints (Tarsometatarsal Articulations)

- Definition: Joints between Tarsal bones and the Metatarsal bones I–V
- Function: Low cushioning/adaptive movements
- Joint type: Amphiarthroses
- Involved Structures
    - Bones: Cuneiform bones, Cuboid bone and Metatarsal bones I–V
    - Soft tissue: Firmly secured by bands
- Special feature: Form the Lisfranc joint line

#### Joints between the metatarsal bones (Articulationes intermetatarsales)

- Definition: Stiff joints, which form between the metatarsal bones II–IV at their base.
- Function: So-called twisting of the foot during pronation and supination
- Joint type: Amphiarthroses
- Involved structures: Base of the ossa metatarsi II-IV, fixed to each other by tight ligaments

### Jaw Joints

In the toe joints, the base joints are distinguished between midfoot and toe bones (metatarsophalangeal joints) from the interphalangeal joints (interphalangeal joints of the foot). The big toe has, in contrast to the other toes, only one interphalangeal joint.

#### Metatarsophalangeal joints (Articulationes metatarsophalangeales)

- Definition: Joints between Metatarsus and Toes (Forefoot phalanges)
- Function
    - Dorsalextension/Plantarflexion
    - Abduction/Adduction
- Joint type: Ball-and-socket joints (morphologically) with two axes
- Involved Structures
    - Bones: Metatarsal bones I–V and proximal phalanges
    - Soft tissue: collateral ligaments, plantar ligaments, deep transverse metatarsal ligament

#### Interphalangeal joints of the toes (Articulationes interphalangeales pedis)

- Definition: The joints between the toe bones are referred to as the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) and the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP); the big toe has only one interphalangeal joint.
- Function: Dorsiflexion/Plantarflexion
- Joint Type: Hinge Joints
- Involved Structures
    - Bones: Proximal/middle phalanges (Head of phalanx) and middle/distal phalanges (Base of phalanx)
    - Soft tissues: collateral ligaments, plantar ligaments
## Muscles

In the foot, four muscle groups are distinguished topographically, which are located in their own compartments: One of them is located on the dorsum of the foot (dorsal), while the other three are situated on the sole of the foot (plantar). In addition, there is also a classification into compartments. However, there is no consensus on their number; generally speaking, they do correspond with the muscle compartments.

1. Muscles of the dorsum of the foot

### Muscles of the dorsum of the foot

On the dorsum of the foot are the M. extensor digitorum brevis and the M. extensor hallucis brevis. Both are presented in the following table. In addition, the tendons of the M. extensor digitorum longus and the M. extensor hallucis longus span the dorsum of the foot. These muscles are discussed in more detail under “Lower leg”.

### Big Toe Log

The great toe loge is located on the plantar side. It includes the M. abductor hallucis and the M. flexor hallucis brevis. The M. adductor hallucis is topographically a muscle of the mid-loge, however, due to its function for the great toe, it is also discussed in this section (if interested, see: Table for the great toe loge).

## Vascular Supply and Innervation

For more precise information on the involved vessels and nerves, see also: Conduits of the lower extremity.

|Vascular supply of the foot|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Arterial|   |- A. dorsalis pedis from A. tibialis anterior<br>- A. plantaris medialis from A. tibialis posterior<br>- A. plantaris lateralis from A. tibialis posterior|
|Venous|Superficial|- Dorsalis pedis venous network in Great saphenous vein in Femoral vein<br>- Lateral marginal vein in Small saphenous vein in Popliteal vein|
|Deep|- Medial plantar vein in the posterior tibial veins<br>- Lateral plantar vein in the posterior tibial veins|
|Innervation of the foot|   |   |
|Motoric|   |- Deep fibular nerve<br>- Medial plantar nerve from Tibial nerve<br>- Lateral plantar nerve from Tibial nerve|
|Sensory|   |- Superficial fibular nerve<br>- Deep fibular nerve<br>- Saphenous nerve from Femoral nerve<br>- Lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve (Only from the Sural nerve)<br>- Medial plantar nerve from Tibial nerve<br>- Lateral plantar nerve from Tibial nerve|

> [!NOTE]
> The dorsum of the foot is innervated by branches of the N. fibularis, while the plantar surface is innervated by branches of the N. tibialis!

> [!NOTE] Tasten of the foot pulses
> On the foot, two arteries can be palpated with some practice using the fingertips (palpating): The posterior tibial artery can be easily felt by placing the fingers from the dorsal side of the medial malleolus (Malleolus medialis). The second palpable artery is the dorsalis pedis artery, which is the continuation of the anterior tibial artery. It can be easily palpated on the dorsum of the foot, more specifically lateral to the tendon of the M. extensor hallucis longus and medial to the M. extensor hallucis brevis between the first and second toes. The palpation of these blood vessels is part of every complete physical examination, during which the vascular status should always be assessed. Palpation of the foot pulses is particularly important in patients with so-called peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). In PAD, the arterial blood flow to the extremities (usually the legs) is chronically reduced, which can lead to a lack of oxygen in the tissues.

### Functional Anatomy

Due to the demands of permanent upright walking, the human foot evolved from a grasping foot to a standing foot. Upright walking changed the load transfer of body weight and led to the formation of the characteristic arch in the foot skeleton.

### Last Transfer and Structural Principle of the Foot

- Background: Throughout human evolution, bipedalism developed, allowing for upright walking on two legs.
    - "Greiffuß" became "Standfuß"
- Path of load transfer
    - Torso → Tibia → Talus → Three contact points between foot and ground
        - Three support beams end at each support point
            - Dorsal ray → Pressure point: Tuber calcanei
            - Medial ray → Support point: head of the Os metatarsi I
            - Lateral beam → Support point: Head of the Os metatarsi V
- Structural Principle of the Foot
    - Arch-shaped structure: See: Foot arch
    - Support structures
        - Chamber of the Subcutis
        - Corneal thickening (keratopathy)

> [!NOTE]
> The body load is cushioned at the foot using foot arches, subcutaneous fat tissue and calluses!

### Arch of the foot

When building the foot, two arch-like structures can be distinguished: a dorso-ventral longitudinal arch and a medio-lateral oriented transverse arch. These arches arise as a result of the tension of the tarsal bones by plantar ligaments and muscles. Both foot arches serve to cushion body weight when walking or jumping.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the plantar ligaments and muscles are responsible for the tension of the foot arches! The dorsal ligaments and muscles do not play a role in this!

> [!NOTE] Spread Foot
> A yielding of the transverse arch can lead to a so-called splay foot (Pes transversus). The splay foot is a foot deformity in which the metatarsal bones increasingly sink downwards due to muscular or connective tissue weakness. Under load, the metatarsal bones then spread apart, resulting in the characteristic widening of the forefoot.

## Topographic Anatomy

In the topography of the foot, two important regions are distinguished: the malleolar region at the transition from the lower leg to the foot, as well as the plantar region of the foot on the sole of the foot.

### Malleolar region

The malleolar region refers to the tissue in the area of the malleolar fork of the lower leg, which forms the transition between the lower leg and the foot. It primarily distinguishes the medial malleolar region at the medial malleolus from the lateral malleolar region at the lateral malleolus.

- Medial malleolar region: The most important structure of this region is the so-called malleolar canal
    - Malleolar canal (= Tarsal tunnel, Canalis malleolaris)
        - Definition: Canal formed by the Calcaneus and the Retinaculum of the flexor muscles of the foot
        - Location: Runs dorso-caudal to the medial malleolus and then extends to the plantar side of the foot.
        - Content
            - Conduits
                - A./V. tibialis posterior
                - N. tibialis
            - Tendons of the deep posterior compartment flexor muscles
- Lateral malleolar region
    - Location: Dorsocaudal of the lateral malleolus
    - Included anatomical structures
        - Conduction pathways
            - V. saphena parva
            - N. cutaneus dorsalis lateralis
        - Tendons of the Fibularis group: Run under the superior fibular retinaculum and inferior
- Ventral Malleolar region
    - Location: Transition area from distal, ventral lower leg to the dorsum of the foot
    - Anatomical structures
        - Tendons of the extensor group of the lower leg: Run under the superior extensor retinaculum and inferior

> [!NOTE] Tarsal tunnel syndrome
> The tarsal tunnel syndrome is classified as a nerve compression syndrome and causes neurological deficits. To get from the lower leg to the sole of the foot, several conduits and tendons must pass through the tarsal tunnel (malleolar canal). This canal represents a kind of bottleneck due to the narrow topographical relationship between bones, ligaments, and penetrating structures. In the case of a fracture of the medial malleolus or a distortion ("sprain") in the ankle joint, compression of the N. tibialis under the retinaculum musculorum flexorum pedis can occur due to bleeding or an edema. The compression of the distal N. tibialis is mainly manifested by sensory deficits in the sole of the foot. Motor deficits are generally not noticeable, as the long toe flexors compensate for the plantarflexion of the foot.

### Plantar region of the foot (= Sole of the foot, Sole of the foot)

The plantar region of the foot refers to the tissue between the skin of the sole of the foot and the foot skeleton; it contains the structures mentioned below.

- Plantar aponeurosis (= Plantar aponeurosis)
    - Definition: Aponeurosis made of tight connective tissue fibers that extends between the calcaneus and the metatarsophalangeal joints.
    - Function
        - Connection of skin, muscle, and foot skeleton into a functional unit
        - Tension of the longitudinal arch of the foot
- Three muscle compartments (= loges)
    - Medial compartment: Contains muscles of the great toe compartment
    - Middle layer: Contains the muscles M. adductor hallucis, M. quadratus plantae, Mm. lumbricales, M. flexor digitorum brevis
    - Lateral compartment: Contains muscles of the little toe compartment
- Nerve pathways: Run plantar in two vascular-nervous streets
    - A./V./N. medial plantar
    - A./V./N. plantaris lateralis
- Plantar chiasm
## Review Questions on the Chapter Ankles and Feet
### Bone

Name the tarsal bones in their order from proximal to distal!
- The proximal tarsus is formed by the talus, which articulates distally with the calcaneus and ventrally with the navicular bone. The distal row of tarsal bones consists medially of the three cuneiform bones (medial, intermediate, lateral), to which the cuboid bone attaches laterally.

### Ankles

Which structures are involved in the ankle joint?
- The distal lower ankle joint is formed bony by the talus, calcaneus, and navicular bone. It is stabilized by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament, the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (= spring ligament), and the bifurcate ligament.

Based on which structure is the lower ankle joint divided into two anatomically independent joints?
- The interosseous talocalcaneal ligament runs in the sinus tarsi between the talus and calcaneus and divides the lower ankle joint (subtalar joint) into the anterior (= talocalcaneonavicular joint, involving all three lower ankle bones) and the posterior chamber (= subtalar joint, involving only talus and calcaneus). Despite this anatomical separation, the lower ankle joint is a functional unit, as the two chambers cannot be moved independently of each other.

### Joints of the Foot

Which structures form the Chopart joint?
- The Chopart joint (= transverse tarsal joint) consists of two individual joints: the calcaneocuboid joint and the talocalcaneonavicular joint. Together they form the S-shaped joint space of the Chopart joint.

Where does the Lisfranc joint line run?
- The Lisfranc joint line (= tarsometatarsal joint) separates the distal tarsal bones from the midfoot. It runs between the cuneiform bones, cuboid bone, and metatarsal bones I–IV.

### Muscles

Which muscles originate from the dorsal side of the calcaneus?
- Two muscles originate on the dorsal side of the calcaneus: the extensor digitorum brevis muscle and the extensor hallucis brevis muscle.

Name the origin and approach of the M. quadratus plantae!
- The quadratus plantae muscle is a muscle in the middle layer of the sole of the foot and runs from the tuber calcanei of the calcaneus to the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus muscle.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

Where can the pulses be palpated during the physical examination of the foot, and which arteries are involved?
- During physical examination, on the dorsum of the foot lateral to the tendon of the extensor hallucis longus muscle between the first and second toes, the dorsalis pedis artery (terminal branch of the anterior tibial artery) can be palpated. At the medial ankle, the posterior tibial artery can be palpated from dorsal.

How is the foot sensitively supplied?
- The dorsal foot is supplied sensibly (and motorically) by branches of the common fibular nerve; the sole of the foot is supplied by branches of the tibial nerve (medial and lateral plantar nerves). Additionally, the foot is innervated by the saphenous nerve as well as the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve, a terminal branch of the sural nerve, which supplies the lateral border of the foot.

### Functional Anatomy

Which muscles tense the transverse and longitudinal arch of the foot? What function do they have?
- The transverse arch of the foot is spanned by the fibularis longus muscle, tibialis posterior muscle, and adductor hallucis muscle. The flexor digitorum longus and brevis as well as the flexor hallucis longus and brevis form the longitudinal arch of the foot. They serve to cushion the forces acting during walking and jumping.

What structure gives the transverse arch of the foot its shape?
- The shaping elements of the transverse arch of the foot are the intermediate and lateral cuneiform bones. They are wedge-shaped in cross-section (in the frontal plane) and thereby form an arch shape when adjacent.
