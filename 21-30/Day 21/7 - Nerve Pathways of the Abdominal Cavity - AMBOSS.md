# Nerve Pathways of the Abdominal Cavity
## Summary

The larger vessels (abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava) as well as the nerves supplying the abdominal cavity mainly run in the retroperitoneal connective tissue. Retroperitoneal organs are supplied by vessels running retroperitoneally, whereas the vessels to the intraperitoneal organs first run through a peritoneal duplication (mesentery) before they reach the respective organs.
## Arteries

The arteries of the abdominal cavity all originate from the abdominal aorta. This emerges from the thoracic aorta after passing through the diaphragm. The paired and unpaired branches of the abdominal aorta supply the entire abdominal cavity. Details about the metabolism of the digestive system are presented in exercise physiology (see: exercise physiology and aging).

### Overview Abdominal Aorta

- Origin: transition from thoracic aorta after its passage through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm (T12)
- Course: Retroperitoneal
    - Links to the median plane
    - Ventral of the spine
    - Division at the level of the navel or LWK4 (at the bifurcation of the aorta) into the common iliac arteries
- Departures (from cranial to caudal)
    - Aa. phrenicae inferiores
    - Celiac trunk
    - Middle adrenal gland, right and left

##### A. superior mesenteric

The superior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta at approximately the level of lumbar vertebrae 1-2 and then travels anteriorly and inferiorly while giving off the branches mentioned below.

|Main Outflows|Course|Branches|Supply Area|
|---|---|---|---|
|A. pancreaticoduodenalis inferior|- Runs cranially in the area of the horizontal part of the duodenum towards the head of the pancreas|- R. anterior and R. posterior → Anastomoses with the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery anteriorly and posteriorly|- Duodenum<br>- Head of the pancreas|

### Important Anastomoses

All the unpaired vessel branches of the abdominal aorta form anastomoses. In the event of a vessel occlusion, collateral circulation can maintain the perfusion of the organs with blood. There are three important such anastomoses.

1. Celiac trunk ↔︎ Gastroduodenal arteries ↔︎ Superior mesenteric artery
2. A. mesenterica superior ↔︎ A. colica media/left ↔︎ A. mesenterica inferior (Riolan anastomosis)
3. Inferior mesenteric artery ↔︎ Superior rectal artery/media ↔︎ Internal iliac artery

> [!NOTE]
> All the unpaired vessel branches of the abdominal aorta form anastomoses!

## Venom

For the venous drainage of the abdominal cavity, two separate systems are initially responsible, which only unite shortly before flowing into the heart: inferior vena cava and hepatic portal vein.

### Overview of the Inferior Vena Cava

The inferior vena cava is located retroperitoneally and collects the blood from the lower extremity, the walls of the abdomen and pelvis, the pelvic organs (except for the upper sections of the rectum), and the paired organs of the retroperitoneal space.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Arises from the confluence of the common iliac veins (LWK 5)|
|Course|- Moves cranially to the right of the aorta<br>- Passes through the diaphragm at the foramen venae cavae (T8)<br>- Drains into the thorax into the right atrium|
|Inflow|- Right inferior phrenic veins<br>- Four lumbar veins<br>- Renal vein<br>- Ovarian vein (♀) or testicular vein right (♂)<br>- Right suprarenal vein<br>- Three hepatic veins|
|Drainage Area|- Lower Extremity<br>- Abdominal Wall<br>- Pelvic Wall<br>- Pelvic Organs and the Paired Organs of the Retroperitoneal Space|

#### Main tributaries of the inferior vena cava at a glance

|Inflows|Drainage Area|Special Features|
|---|---|---|
|V. phrenica inferior  <br>(pair)|- Diaphragm lower side|- The left V. phrenica inferior drains into the V. cava inferior and typically also via the left V. suprarenalis into the left V. renalis|
|Lumbar vertebrae  <br>(four on each side)|- Abdominal wall<br>- Back muscles<br>- Vertebral canal|- Connected to each other via one ascending lumbar vertebra|
|Renal vein (right and left)|- Kidneys|- Left renal vein runs ventral to the abdominal aorta and dorsal to the superior mesenteric artery (so-called nutcracker phenomenon)<br>    - It can possibly get compressed between both vessels, leading to symptoms (so-called nutcracker syndrome)|
|R. ovarian  <br>(right)<br><br>R. testicular  <br>(right)|- Ovaries or Testes|- The left R. ovarian (♀) or testicular (♂) drains indirectly into the L. renal vein into the I. cava inferior|
|V. suprarenalis  <br>(right)|- Adrenal gland|- The right V. suprarenalis typically drains directly into the V. cava inferior, while the left V. suprarenalis usually drains into the left V. renalis, thus providing an indirect inflow to the V. cava inferior|
|Vv. hepaticae (-dextra, -intermedia, -sinistra)|- Unpaired organs of the stomach-intestinal tract|- The blood from the unpaired organs of the gastrointestinal tract only reaches the inferior vena cava after passing through the liver (portal circulation)|

### Hepatic portal vein

The hepatic portal vein (portal vein of the liver) is only 4–7 cm long and runs intraperitoneally in the hepatoduodenal ligament to the hilum of the liver. It carries the nutrient-rich blood from all digestive organs (except for the lower rectum) and the spleen to the liver, where it mixes with the oxygen-rich blood from the proper hepatic artery. This "mixed blood" flows through the liver and is then drained into the inferior vena cava via the hepatic veins.

- Origin: Confluence of the portal vein = Confluence of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein dorsal to the head of the pancreas (approximately at the level of LWK2)
- Course: In the hepatoduodenal ligament to the porta hepatis
- Storm area: Spleen and digestive organs

#### Main Inflows

The hepatic portal vein receives blood directly from smaller veins as well as from the splenic vein, the superior mesenteric vein, and inferior.

##### Direct inflows from small veins

|Main Vessel|Course|Tributaries|   |Drainage Area|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|V. portae hepatis|- Formation through the confluence of the V. splenica with V. mesenterica superior in the so-called Confluens venae portae (hepatic) dorsal to the head of the pancreas<br>- Runs together with A. hepatica propria and Ductus choledochus in the Lig. hepatoduodenale to the hilum of the liver|- V. prepylorica|   |- Pylorus, Stomach (lesser curvature)|
|- Right and left gastric veins|   |
|- V. cystica|   |- Gallbladder|
|- Paraumbilical veins|   |- None|
|- Superior posterior pancreaticoduodenal artery|   |- Pancreas|

##### Indirect inflows through large veins

|Main Vessel|Course of the Main Vessel|Tributaries|   |Drainage Area|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|V. splenica|- Formation in the splenic hilum from several branches<br>- Course behind the pancreas and caudal to the A. splenica to the porta hepatis<br>- Main inflow: V. mesenterica inferior in the area of the corpus pancreatis<br>- Union with V. mesenterica superior to form V. portae hepatis|- Vv. pancreaticae|   |- Pancreas|
|- Short gastric veins|   |- Stomach (Fundus)|
|- V. gastroomentalis sinistra|   |- Stomach (greater curvature left)|
|- Inferior mesenteric vein |- Left colic vein |- Descending colon|

|- Superior rectal vein|- Upper part of the rectum|
|V. mesenterica superior|- Course analogous to the A. mesenterica superior<br>- Union with V. splenica to form V. portae hepatis|- V. gastroomentalis dextra|   |- Stomach (greater curvature right)|
|- Pancreatic veins|   |- Pancreas|
|- Pancreaticoduodenal Vessels|   |- Duodenum and Pancreas|
|- Jejunal veins and Ileal veins|   |- Jejunum and Ileum|
|- ileocolic vein |- cecal veins |- Cecum|
|- V. appendicularis|- Vermiform appendix|
|- Right colic|   |- Ascending colon|
|- V. colica media|   |- Transverse colon|

### Important Anastomoses and Bypass Circuits

One distinguishes cavo-caval anastomoses (connections between the superior vena cava and inferior) from porto-caval anastomoses (connections between the vena cava and hepatic portal vein).

#### Kavokavale Anastomoses

Kavokavale Anastomoses refer to the connections between the upper and lower V. cava. Here, one distinguishes between anastomoses on the dorsal and ventral body wall. The anastomoses can form bypass circulation in the event of an obstruction of the V. cava inferior or superior (e.g., due to a mass effect).

- Anastomoses on the dorsal trunk wall
    - Inferior vena cava → Ascending lumbar vein → Azygos vein (right) or Hemiazygos vein (left) → Superior vena cava
    - Inferior vena cava → Lumbar vein ascending → Lumbar veins → Venous plexuses of the vertebrae → Posterior intercostal veins → Azygos vein (right) or Hemiazygos vein (left) → Superior vena cava
- Anstomoses on the ventral abdominal wall
    - Inferior vena cava → Common iliac vein → External iliac vein → Inferior epigastric vein → Superior epigastric vein → Internal thoracic vein → Subclavian vein → Brachiocephalic vein → Superior vena cava
    - Inferior vena cava → Common iliac vein → External iliac vein → Femoral vein → Superficial epigastric vein → Thoracoepigastric vein → Axillary vein → Subclavian vein → Brachiocephalic vein → Superior vena cava

#### Portocaval Anastomoses

The blood from the digestive organs primarily flows through the hepatic portal vein to the liver. If the blood flow through the hepatic portal vein is disturbed (e.g. in the case of liver cirrhosis), it can lead to a backflow of blood into the veins of the abdominal cavity. The blood can then increasingly flow through slowly opening collateral vessels directly into the hollow veins – so-called collateral circulations are formed. This process is only possible through specific veins at the "edge" of the gastrointestinal tract (for example, at the esophagogastric junction), which physiologically are able to allow their blood to flow in two directions: either into the hepatic portal vein or into the hollow veins (Vv. cavae).

- Anastomose via the esophageal veins
    - Hepatic portal vein → Gastric veins → Esophageal veins → Azygos vein (right) or Hemiazygos vein (left) → Superior vena cava
- Anastomose over the paraumbilical veins
    1. Circulation: Hepatic portal vein → Paraumbilical veins → Inferior epigastric vein → External iliac vein → Common iliac vein → Inferior vena cava
    2. Circulation: Hepatic portal vein → Paraumbilical veins → Superior epigastric vein → Internal thoracic vein → Subclavian vein → Brachiocephalic vein → Superior vena cava
- Anastomose via the rectal veins
    - Hepatic vein → Inferior mesenteric vein → Superior rectal vein → Medial rectal veins and inferior rectal veins → Internal iliac vein → Inferior vena cava
- Anastomose over the colonic veins
    - Hepatic Vein → Superior Mesenteric Vein or Inferior Mesenteric Vein → Colic Veins → Lumbar Veins ascending → Azygos Vein (right) or Hemiazygos Vein (left) → Superior Vena Cava

Consequences of blood flow through portacaval anastomoses  
Increased blood flow in the esophageal veins can cause them to dilate into so-called esophageal varices (protrusions of the esophageal veins), which can bleed profusely and be life-threatening if they rupture. With increased blood flow through the paraumbilical veins, these can enlarge and become visible on the abdominal wall, a condition referred to as caput medusae. Due to increased blood flow through the rectal veins, these can expand in a hemorrhoidal manner, although they are not true hemorrhoids but are based on an enlargement of the corpus cavernosum recti.
## Nervous System

Both the abdominal wall and the organs of the abdominal cavity are innervated by the autonomic nervous system (i.e., sympathetic and parasympathetic). The sympathetic nervous system originates from the lateral horns of the spinal cord and forms two paravertebral "ganglion chains" in the thoracic and abdominal regions, known as the sympathetic trunk. The switching of the sympathetic fibers typically occurs away from the organ, with the fibers for the trunk wall switching in the sympathetic trunk and the fibers for the abdominal organs switching in prevertebral ganglia. The parasympathetic innervation extends to the left colic flexure (the so-called “Cannon-Böhm point”) via the vagus nerve and beyond that through parasympathetic nerves that originate directly from the lateral horns of the spinal cord (pelvic splanchnic nerves). The switching of the parasympathetic fibers to the second neuron typically occurs near the organ.

### Sympathetic Innervation of the Abdominal Organs

#### Procedure

1. Origin (1. Neuron): Lateral horns of the spinal cord (Ncl. intermediolateralis)
2. Paravertebral ganglia
    1. Thoracic ganglia (Th5–Th12): Located in the chest area in front of the rib heads.
    2. Lumbar ganglia (L1–L4): Are located bilaterally lateral to the spine
3. Forwarding
    - Major splanchnic nerves (Th5–Th9) and minor splanchnic nerves (Th10–Th11)
        - Branch off from the thoracic cavity and traverse the diaphragm
        - Pulling to prevertebral ganglia
    - Lateral splanchnic nerves (L1–L2): Extending from ganglia on the anterior or lateral surface of the lumbar spine to prevertebral ganglia
4. Switching (2. Neuron): In prevertebral ganglia (see below)

#### Sympathetic (prevertebral) ganglia of the abdominal cavity

- Celiac ganglion
    - Location: Around the celiac trunk
    - Preganglionic inputs: Mainly fibers of the greater splanchnic nerve
    - Organs of Success: Stomach, Liver, Gallbladder, Pancreas, Spleen, Kidneys
- Superior mesenteric ganglion
    - Location: Regarding the departure of the superior mesenteric artery
    - Preganglionic inflows: Mainly fibers of the minor splanchnic nerve
    - Organs of success: Small intestine, Ascending colon and parts of the Transverse colon
- Aorticorenal ganglia
    - Location: Regarding the branches of the renal arteries
    - Preganglionic inputs: Mainly fibers from the minor splanchnic nerve and possibly fibers from the least splanchnic nerve
    - Success organs: Kidneys, Adrenal glands, Ureters
- Inferior mesenteric ganglion
    - Location: Regarding the departure of the A. mesenterica inferior
    - Preganglionic inputs: Mainly fibers of the lumbar splanchnic nerves

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Chest part|Th5–Th9|Thoracic ganglion|Greater splanchnic nerve|- Celiac ganglion<br>- Superior mesenteric ganglion<br>- Aorticorenal ganglion|Celiac ganglion: Stomach, Liver, Gallbladder, Pancreas, Spleen, Kidneys|

### Course of the parasympathetic nervous system in the abdominal cavity

The parasympathetic innervation of the abdominal cavity occurs via two branches of the vagus nerve: the anterior vagal trunk and posterior. The anterior vagal trunk ends at the stomach, while the posterior vagal trunk extends to the left colic flexure (to the so-called "Cannon-Böhm point") and innervates the abdominal organs up to that point. From this point on, the pelvic splanchnic nerves take over the parasympathetic innervation. The fibers are switched over only in small ganglia close to the organs.

#### Left Colic Flexure: Vagus Nerve

- Anterior vagal trunk
    - Course: Extends through the hiatus esophageus into the abdominal cavity to the front of the stomach
    - Branches
        - Anterior gastric wall: Front side of the stomach
        - Rr. hepatici: Liver, Pylorus
- Posterior vagal trunk
    - History
        - Passes through the hiatus esophageus into the abdominal cavity to the back of the stomach
        - Runs through the sympathetic celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion and inferior without switching
        - Switching in small parasympathetic ganglia close to the target organ
    - Branches
        - Rr. gastrici posteriores: Posterior gastric branches
        - Celia: Celiac plexus
        - Renal veins: Renal plexus

#### Left Colic Flexure: Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves

- Definition: The only parasympathetic splanchnic nerves of humans.
- Origin: 1. Neuron (originating neuron) in the lateral horns of the spinal cord segments S2–S4
- Course: Switching to 2nd neuron in ganglia of the inferior hypogastric plexus, followed by traction to the subplexus.
- Function: Control of defecation, micturition, and genital function (including erection)

> [!NOTE]
> The Cannon-Böhm point is the location from which the parasympathetic innervation is no longer provided by fibers of the vagus nerve, but rather through the pelvic splanchnic nerves!

## Lymphatic System

The lymph drainage of the individual organs occurs through organ lymph nodes further to collecting lymph nodes and finally into one of the major lymph trunks, which converge at the cisterna chyli to form the so-called thoracic duct. This empties into the left venous angle, where the lymph is returned to the blood circulation.

### Important Collecting Lymph Nodes

The collecting lymph nodes are usually located along the large vessels.

- Iliac nerves (internal, external, and common)
    - Location: Between the branches of the internal iliac artery, external, and common
    - Lymphatic drainage: From the lower extremities and the organs of the pelvis
- Lumbar vertebrae
    - Location: Group around the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta
    - Lymphatic drainage: From the gonads and the retroperitoneal space
- Superior and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes
    - Location: At the origins of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.
    - Lymphatic drainage: From the intestine (according to the supply of the similarly named vessels)
- Nll. celiac
    - Location: Around the celiac trunk
    - Lymph flow: From liver, gallbladder, pancreas, stomach and spleen

### Lymph Trunks (Trunci)

There are the paired lumbar trunks (right and left) and the unpaired intestinal trunk. The three trunks unite at the level of the aortic hiatus to form the so-called thoracic duct. At this point, there is a dilation called the cisterna chyli. The thoracic duct runs along behind the aorta to the left venous angle, where it ultimately drains.

- Lumbar trunk right and left
    - Lymphatic drainage: From the lower extremities, the abdominal wall, the pelvis, the pelvic organs, and the retroperitoneum
- Intestinal trunk
    - Lymphatic drainage: From the digestive organs and the spleen
## Review Questions on the Chapter of the Abdominal Pathways
### Arteries

What unpaired branches does the abdominal aorta have?
- The abdominal aorta has three unpaired branches to supply the unpaired digestive organs and the spleen: the celiac trunk, as well as the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries (in addition, it gives off paired branches to the abdominal wall, the paired retroperitoneal organs, and the gonads).
Name the direct branches of the celiac trunk!
- Three direct branches arise from the celiac trunk: the left gastric artery, the splenic artery, and the common hepatic artery.
At about what level are the origins of the right and left renal arteries? Which other artery arises at approximately the same level?
- The right and left renal arteries originate from the aorta at about lumbar vertebra L1/2, approximately at the same level as the superior mesenteric artery.
From which artery does the A. pancreatica magna originate and how does it course?
- The A. pancreatica magna originates from the splenic artery. It runs dorsal to the tail of the pancreas downward and anastomoses with the dorsal pancreatic artery to form the inferior pancreatic artery.
From which artery does the A. gastroduodenalis originate, how does it course, and which organs does it supply?
- The common hepatic artery divides into the proper hepatic artery and the gastroduodenal artery. The latter runs dorsal to the lesser omentum to the pancreas and here divides into two branches to supply the pancreas, duodenum, and stomach.
At what height does the A. mesenterica inferior arise from the aorta and which organs does it supply?
- The inferior mesenteric artery originates at the level of lumbar vertebra L3 from the aorta and supplies the colon below the left colic flexure.
Which arteries are involved in the Riolan anastomosis?
- The superior mesenteric artery anastomoses via the middle/left colic arteries with the inferior mesenteric artery (Riolan anastomosis).
### Veins

Where do the veins of the gonads drain?
- The left ovarian or testicular vein drains into the left renal vein; in contrast, the right ovarian or testicular vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava.
Between which vessels can the left renal vein be compressed (so-called Nutcracker phenomenon)?
- The left renal vein runs roughly horizontally between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery to the inferior vena cava. It can be compressed between these two arteries (so-called Nutcracker phenomenon).
Name the most important direct inflows of the inferior vena cava!
- The most important direct tributaries of the inferior vena cava include the paired inferior phrenic veins, renal veins, and suprarenal veins, as well as the lumbar veins, hepatic veins, and the right ovarian or testicular vein.
Which veins drain into the splenic vein into the hepatic portal vein?
- The tributaries of the splenic vein are the pancreatic veins, short gastric veins, left gastro-omental vein, and the inferior mesenteric vein.
Which esophageal and rectal veins are involved in portocaval anastomoses?
- The portocaval anastomosis via the rectal veins is formed by the portal vein → inferior mesenteric vein → superior rectal vein → middle and inferior rectal veins → internal iliac vein → inferior vena cava. In the portocaval anastomosis via the esophageal veins, blood flows via the portal vein → gastric veins → esophageal veins → azygos vein (right) or hemiazygos vein (left) into the superior vena cava.
### Nervous System

What does the so-called Cannon-Böhm point indicate?
- At the so-called Cannon-Böhm point at the left colic flexure, the innervation territory of the posterior vagal trunk from the vagus nerve ends. From here, the pelvic splanchnic nerves take over the parasympathetic innervation of the abdominal cavity.
Describe the course of the truncus vagalis posterior!
- The posterior vagal trunk passes through the esophageal hiatus from the thorax into the abdomen. It reaches the posterior surface of the stomach; its fibers then pass without synapsing through the sympathetic celiac ganglia, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion. The fibers synapse only within the target organs in small parasympathetic ganglia.
Where do the Nn. splanchnici major and minor originate from and what is their function?
- The major (Th5–Th9) and minor (Th10–Th11) splanchnic nerves originate from the thoracic region and are (together with the lumbar splanchnic nerves) responsible for the sympathetic innervation of the abdominal organs. They branch off the thoracic ganglia, pass through the diaphragm, and reach the prevertebral ganglia where they synapse.
### Lymphatic System

How is the lymph of the intestine drained?
- The lymph from the intestine is drained by lymph vessels that run analogously to the corresponding arteries and veins and thus reach the superior and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes at the origins of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries.
Which lymph trunks (trunci) are there in the abdominal cavity and what is the cisterna chyli?
- The lymph vessels of the abdominal and pelvic cavities unite into the paired lumbar trunks and the unpaired intestinal trunk. These three trunks then converge at the level of the aortic hiatus into the thoracic duct. At this point, there is an enlargement called the cisterna chyli.
