# Examination and Conversation
## Summary

The examination and the conversation are central components of the collaboration between doctors and patients. In this context, the initial contact significantly influences the subsequent course, as it is crucial for establishing a good doctor-patient relationship.

In the context of exploration and medical history, important information regarding the current situation is collected and the individual medical history is inquired. It is important to know the various communication techniques in order to use them effectively during the course of the conversation.

The frequently required physical examination presents a situation that differs from normal everyday situations for both the examining and the examined person, and thus requires a special empathy. For example, a calm atmosphere should be ensured and all steps should be communicated.
## First Contact

The initial contact plays an important role in the further course of treatment. Therefore, it is important to build mutual trust and recognize the shared tasks. However, it should be noted that both parties approach the situation from different perspectives.

### Patient Perspective

Patients encounter their healthcare provider with individual expectations and prejudices that should be discussed and taken into account.

- Expectations for the doctor's visit
    - Sufficient time
    - Understandable language
    - Diagnosis
    - Receiving an effective therapy
    - Experiencing a forecast
- Reasons for prejudices before visiting the doctor
    - Previous experiences
    - Negative examples from the media, but also media-conveyed unrealistic expectations
    - Subjective Theories of Illness
    - Causal attribution

### Doctor's Perspective

Physicians should be aware that their impression can be influenced and possibly distorted by several effects. The following effects are listed.

- Stereotype: Generalized prejudices against oneself, other social groups, or an individual that are independent of personal experiences.
- Observation and assessment errors
    - Halo effect (= halo error): Obvious or known traits are used to infer unknown traits.
    - Projection: Unaccepted traits in oneself are incorrectly attributed to other people.
    - Contrast error: A characteristic is erroneously perceived as too strong or too weak due to the contrast with a reference group.
    - Mild error (Mild effect): Refers to a phenomenon where people, for instance out of consideration, make milder judgments than they would upon closer reflection.
    - Strictness error (Strictness effect): Refers to a phenomenon where people, for example, judge a behavior that they personally disapprove of more harshly than they would upon closer consideration.
    - Effect of central tendency: People often hesitate to make extreme judgments.
    - Yes-saying tendency: Some people tend to say "yes" rather than "no"
- Expectation effects
    - Hawthorne Effect: People behave differently under observation than they normally would.
    - Rosenthal Effect
        - The expectations of the treating person influence the outcome.
        - Through a double blinding (neither researchers nor participants know what type of treatment is being administered), this effect is attempted to be prevented in studies.
    - Placebo Effect: Effect of a dummy medication or sham treatment
    - Nocebo effect: The expectation that complaints will occur or worsen actually leads to complaints (e.g., after reading the package insert)
- Primacy and Recency Effect: Both the first and the last impression are remembered more strongly and influence the subsequent course more than all the information in between.

> Determined by the phenomenon of the first and last impression, the perception of a striking facial color can lead the examining person to conclude a possible alcoholism and to direct their further questions and diagnostics accordingly.

## Exploration and Medical History

In the exploration and medical history, important information about the current disease situation and the medical history can be gathered. The exploration and the medical history can serve different functions and can be conducted in various ways. Physicians need to be aware that difficulties and barriers exist that they must appropriately address.

### Function

- Function for doctors
    - Data Acquisition
    - Diagnostics
    - Exclusion of possible differential diagnoses
    - Therapy planning
- Function for patients
    - Enlightenment
    - Education
    - Emotional support and therapeutic function

> [!NOTE]
> The personal conversation should not be overlooked, especially in today's time, considering the increased use of technology and the existing lack of time!

### Forms of Anamnesis

There are different forms of exploration and medical history. It is not always necessary to collect all of them. In addition to the individual forms of medical history, the behavior of the patients should always be observed.

- Personal Medical History: Includes everything that can be reported about one's own medical history.
- Family Medical History: Includes all information provided by relatives.
- Medical history
    - Current Medical History: Includes current complaints and symptoms
    - Vegetative Anamnese: Includes, for example, vital signs, weight, and excretion.
    - Medical history: Includes, for example, previous illnesses and surgeries
- Medication history
- Family history: Includes diseases in the family as an indication of hereditary predispositions.
- Social history: Includes, for example, occupation, marital status, living situation, and personal interests.
- Developmental history: Includes conditions in the parental home and the course of childhood and adolescence.

> [!NOTE]
> During the anamnesis and exploration, it is additionally important to also examine primarily unaffected organ systems (system overview)!

> [!NOTE] Medical history in the general practice setting
> The multitude of individuals seen in general medical practice can sometimes present a significant challenge. However, to ensure good care, a thorough yet targeted medical history and physical examination are crucial. A central principle in this regard is the principle of watchful waiting. Often, symptoms cannot be clearly assigned to a diagnosis, or the symptom picture resolves on its own. In such cases, further diagnostics and therapy may be omitted, and the course can be observed. However, this is only justifiable if differential diagnoses have been adequately assessed beforehand, a time limit has been set, and patients are regularly recalled.

### Procedure

To achieve a pleasant and goal-oriented medical history for both parties, there are several steps that should be considered. A fundamental prerequisite is to create a comfortable environment. Furthermore, there are many communication techniques that can be applied depending on the situation and the person.

#### Structure of the medical history collection

In the medical history, the primary goal is to establish a diagnosis and potential differential diagnoses. Furthermore, the patient's perspective should always be taken into account during the medical history interview. Thus, the diagnosis should not simply be communicated, but the wishes and concerns of the patient should also be addressed. It is also helpful to inquire about the causes that patients themselves attribute to their illness, as these subjective illness beliefs can sometimes influence the further course of the disease.

- Establishing a relationship
    - Capturing already existing data
    - Greeting with name mention
    - Introducing oneself
- Ask about the reason for coming: It is advisable to start with open questions. The initial description should not be interrupted or directed in a specific way.
- Agreeing on a topic list: This captures the goals and wishes of both parties.
- Conducting the actual anamnese: Taking into account the Calgary-Cambridge model
    - Use of open and closed questions
    - Active Listening
    - No interrupting
    - Inquiries
    - Regular summarizing and organizing of the mentioned information
    - Precise and easy-to-understand questions and answers
    - Avoid or, if necessary, explain technical terms.

#### Conversation Techniques

Different conversation techniques allow for the anamnesis interview to be tailored individually and according to the situation.

##### Degree of structuring

- Fully structured interview
    - All questions and their order are clearly defined.
    - Rather unsuitable for taking the medical history, as it cannot address the individual person.
- Semi-structured interview
    - A series of important questions is provided, which can be supplemented and varied.
    - Well suited for collecting medical history
- Unstructured (qualitative) interview
    - There is no framework; the interviewed person should be able to speak freely about thoughts and feelings.
    - Rather unsuitable for taking the medical history, as points can be easily forgotten.

##### Question Styles

- Open questions: No answer options are provided.
- Closed questions: The number of response options is limited.
    - Alternative questions: There are two response options available.
    - Catalog questions: More than two answer options are provided for selection.
- Leading questions: Leading questions should be avoided, as the person being questioned is led in a desired direction by the wording of the question (effect of suggestion).

##### Active Listening

- Paraphrasing: Reproduction of what is heard in one's own words
- Physicians demonstrate attention and empathetic interest in the accounts.
- Confirmation of the interviewed person's account through, for example, nodding and affirmative vocalizations.
- Application example: Narrative interview
    - Definition: Interview in which the respondents freely tell their life story or experience without interruption while the interviewers actively listen.
    - Procedure: The interview is divided into five phases
        1. Explanation phase: The respondents are informed about the process of the narrative interview
        2. Introductory phase: The interviewers define the area of interest and pose an opening question.
        3. Narrative Phase: The respondents tell their story without interruption until they conclude it on their own.
        4. Inquiry Phase: The interviewers can clarify uncertainties or contradictions.
        5. Accounting Phase: The course of the interview can be reflected upon and discussed by respondents and interviewers.

##### Motivational Interviewing

Motivational Interviewing is a method for strengthening intrinsic motivation to change problematic behavior (e.g., substance abuse). Initially, problems and internal ambivalences regarding the respective behavior are explored and analyzed together. Through engagement with the pros and cons of the behavior, existing ambivalences can be resolved, and pre-existing desires for change can be recognized and strengthened. In the end, specific change goals are agreed upon. The actual implementation of these goals is no longer part of the motivational interviewing.

- Five basic rules of motivational interviewing
    - Express empathy: Individuals are accepted as they are. The decision to change behavior is always made by themselves.
    - Clarifying discrepancies: Problems and ambivalences in behavior are analyzed to achieve a willingness to change.
    - Avoiding arguments: The practitioners do not attempt to convince by presenting arguments. It is the patients who, on their own, provide the reasons for their behavior change.
    - Perceiving resistance: Resistance is perceived as a normal component of behavioral change and is addressed without judgment.
    - Strengthening self-efficacy expectation

> [!NOTE]
> The conversation can be significantly hampered by an existing language barrier (people with limited German skills, different language code)!

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the context in which information is presented, it is perceived differently by the recipient. For example, a surgery is more likely to be approved when a 90% success rate is mentioned rather than a 10% risk that the surgery might fail. This is known as the framing effect!

## Physical Examination

For both parties, the physical examination represents a situation that differs from normal everyday situations and thus requires special empathy.

### Conditions for the physical examination

- Quiet, undisturbed atmosphere
- Sufficiently heated room
- All steps should be communicated.

### Possible difficulties during the physical examination

In the context of the physical examination, there can be challenges for both parties. For patients, the physical examination can represent an absolute exception situation, which they may find very uncomfortable for various reasons. The examining person should always be aware of this in order to respond appropriately.

#### Patient Perspective

- Intimacy
    - Physical components are intimate areas of one's own body or bodily functions.
    - Psychological components are intimate thoughts and feelings
    - Is partially injured during the course of the physical examination
- Shame
- Taboos
- Fear of procedures and pain

> [!NOTE]
> In the context of the physical examination and regarding the points explained above, it is important to consider intercultural as well as gender- and age-specific differences!

> [!NOTE] Gynaecological Examinations
> To address the shame associated with the gynecological examination and make it more comfortable, a two-step approach is recommended. The patient initially undresses only her upper body for the breast examination and then only her lower body for the further gynecological examination.

#### Doctor's Perspective

- Maintaining affective neutrality
- Consideration of intervention rights
    - A medical procedure may only take place once the person to be examined gives their consent.
    - The person to be examined must be sufficiently informed before giving their consent (= informed consent)
- Consideration of sociocultural barriers

> [!NOTE]
> Every medical procedure legally constitutes the offense of bodily harm. Doctors are only permitted to proceed with consent!

> [!NOTE]
> Whoever cannot ensure affective neutrality in the care of a person should hand them over if necessary!

> [!NOTE] Transmission problem
> Transference is a term from psychoanalysis. It describes the fact that past emotional experiences have an impact on present situations. For example, if a doctor is treating a patient who reminds her of a previous person associated with negative feelings, it is possible that she projects her aversions onto the patient.

## Review Questions for the Chapter Investigation and Conversation
### First Contact

What is meant by stereotypes?
- Stereotypes are generalized prejudices towards oneself, other individuals, or social groups that are independent of one's own experiences. To obtain a realistic impression, one should approach all patients as free as possible from prejudices.

Explain the halo effect and provide an example!
- The halo effect is when obvious or known characteristics are used to conclude unknown characteristics (e.g., when a doctor speaks particularly loudly to an older patient because he assumes, based on age, that she hears poorly).

What is meant by a contrast error?
- A contrast error occurs when a characteristic is wrongly perceived as too strong or too weak by contrast to a reference group. For example, an average medical student might seem worse standing next to the top student of the cohort than she actually is.

What is described by the central tendency effect?
- People tend to avoid extreme evaluations and rather make statements that lie within the middle range. This observation is called the central tendency effect.

What is described by the term “Hawthorne effect”?
- The Hawthorne effect occurs when people behave differently under observation than they normally would.

What effect is intended to be avoided by double blinding in studies and why?
- The Rosenthal effect is intended to be avoided by double blinding (where both the examining and examined persons do not know whether someone is assigned to the intervention or reference group), because the expectation of the investigators can influence the results.

What is meant by the placebo effect and what is meant by the nocebo effect?
- The placebo effect describes the effect of a sham medication due to the positive expectations of patients. The nocebo effect, on the other hand, describes complaints that arise due to negative expectations (e.g., by reading the side effects in the package insert).

What is meant by the primacy effect and what is meant by the recency effect?
- Both the first impression (primacy effect) and the last impression (recency effect) remain more strongly in memory than all information in between.

### Exploration and Medical History

What is meant by external anamnesis?
- External anamnesis refers to information about persons and their medical history that is provided not by the patients themselves but by relatives or others from their environment.

What information is requested in the social history?
- Social history includes data from social and societal areas such as occupation, family, or hobbies.

How should doctors behave during active listening?
- Techniques of active listening especially include paraphrasing, i.e., repeating what was said in one's own words, and demonstrating interest and confirmation, e.g., by nodding and approving sounds.

What characterizes the type of closed question and what subtypes exist?
- Closed questions limit the number of possible answers. One distinguishes alternative questions with two possible answers ("yes" or "no") from catalog questions with more than two options. This question type should not be used at the beginning of anamnesis.

What is meant by an open question?
- An open question allows feelings and thoughts to be expressed freely; the number of possible answers is not limited as opposed to closed questions.

Which type of question should be avoided during the anamnesis interview and why? Give an example!
- Leading questions should be avoided because the respondent is already directed toward a certain answer by the question itself. An example would be: "So you don't take your tablets daily, right?"

How does a standardized/structured interview proceed and how does an unstandardized interview take place?
- In a standardized interview, the questions, their order, and often the possible answers are predetermined. This type of interview is less suitable for anamnesis dialogues but frequently used in clinical studies. In an unstandardized interview, open questions are asked without a fixed scheme, and patients can freely report about thoughts and feelings.

What characterizes motivational interviewing?
- In motivational interviewing, problems and ambivalences about a certain behavior (e.g., in addiction counseling) are consciously analyzed first. Patients should recognize existing desires to change by weighing advantages and disadvantages of a behavior change and be strengthened in their self-efficacy by the interviewer.

### Physical Examination

What is meant by intervention rights?
- Intervention rights refer to the medical authorization to conduct an examination after consent. Beforehand, patients must be provided with necessary information about the examination.
