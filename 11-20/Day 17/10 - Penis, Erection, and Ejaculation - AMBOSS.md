# Penis, Erection, and Ejaculation
## Summary

The man's penis consists of the urethra, which is encased by three erectile bodies, the paired corpora cavernosa, and the corpus spongiosum. The urethra serves both to channel urine and to emit sperm during copulation. For the embryonic development of the penis, see "Special Sexual Development in Men."

The sexual arousal of a man is based on an interplay of neural and organic components. It is important that the erection is controlled parasympathetically and the ejaculation is controlled sympathetically. Before ejaculation, during the so-called emission, glandular secretions and sperm cells are secreted into the urethra. The emission also plays an important role in the composition of the ejaculate.
## Macroscopic Anatomy of the Penis

### Profile

- Function: Urine diversion, erection, sperm transport
- Location: Extracorporeal
- Length: Very variable; non-erect about 9 cm, erect about 14 cm
- Diameter: Erected approx. 3–4 cm
- Areas
    - Dorsum penis: Front side of the flaccid penis
    - Urethral surface: Backside of the flaccid penis

> [!NOTE]
> Dorsal refers to the surface of the flaccid penis that is visible from the front. Ventral describes the side of the penis that lies against the scrotum when in a flaccid state!

### Structure

The penis is divided into the penile root, the shaft, and the glans. Three erectile bodies run through the penis: The paired corpora cavernosa are responsible for erection, while the corpus spongiosum protects the man's urethra. The functionality of the penis is also supported by muscles and ligaments.

#### Division

1. Radix penis (Root of the penis): Portion of the penis in the superficial perineal space
    - Anchored to the bony pelvis and perineal membrane
2. Corpus penis (Penis shaft): Movable main part
3. Glans penis (glans): Thickening at the distal end of the penis, formed by the corpus spongiosum.
    - Corona glandis (glans corona): Broad, proximal edge of the glans penis
    - Collum glandis (corona glandis groove): Constriction proximal to the expansion of the corona glandis
    - External urethral orifice: Slit-like external opening of the urethra
    - Prepuce: Fold of skin that surrounds the glans penis.
        - Sebaceous glands of the foreskin: The secreted sebum protects the sensitive skin of the glans from drying out.
        - Frenulum of the prepuce: Fixes the foreskin ventrally to the penile shaft

#### Muscles

The muscles of the penis belong to the pelvic floor muscles.

- M. ischiocavernosus
    - Origin: Ramus of the ischium
    - Approach: Tunica albuginea of the crura of the penis of the corpora cavernosa
    - Function: Strengthening of the erection through compression of the erectile tissue
- M. bulbospongiosus: Envelops the bulb of the penis of the corpus spongiosum
    - Origin: Perineal body + Raphe of the penis
    - Approach: Penile fascia
    - Function: Rhythmic contractions during orgasm lead to a pressure wave in the urethral corpus cavernosum → Support ejaculation

#### Bands

- Fundiform ligament of the penis: Arises from the abdominal wall fascia in the area of the linea alba and encircles the root of the penis.
- Lig. suspensorium penis: Deep-seated suspensory ligament; fixes the penile fascia to the symphysis.

## Microscopic Anatomy of the Penis

The penis is surrounded by three penile sheaths. The histological structure of the erectile bodies of the penis allows for an erection, which can occur either spontaneously or as a result of mechanical and/or psychological stimuli (such as during sexual arousal).

- Penis sleeves (from outside to inside)
    - Penishaut: Fat-free, easily movable
    - Subcutaneous tissue of the penis (Colles fascia): Subcutaneous fascia with embedded smooth muscle cells, movable
    - Fascia penis (Buck's fascia): Dense connective tissue that surrounds all 3 erectile bodies and the dorsal vessels.
- Fine structure of the erectile tissue
    1. Corpora cavernosa
        - Consists of anastomosing, endothelium-lined cavities (Cavernae corporum cavernosorum), which are supplied by the A. profunda penis.
        - Supported by a framework of tensile, elastic connective tissue and smooth muscle cells (trabeculae of the corpora cavernosa)
        - Septum penis: Separates the two corpora cavernosa from each other.
        - Tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa: The firm, connective tissue sheath surrounding the erectile tissue.
    2. Spongy body
        - Consists of anastomosing endothelium-lined cavities (Cavernae corporum spongiosum) that resemble a venous plexus.
        - Supported by a trabecular framework (trabeculae of the spongy body)
        - Tunica albuginea of the corpus spongiosum: Firm, connective tissue sheath

## Sexual Arousal and Erection

### Phases of Sexual Arousal

Sexual arousal consists of five phases and is discussed in more detail under "Sexuality and Sexual Medicine."

### Erection

The erection and stiffening of the penis is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system through the sacral erection center and occurs primarily through the arterial congestion of the corpora cavernosa.

- Stimulation: The excitation of the sacral erection center can occur reflexogenically or psychogenically.
    - Reflexogen: Sensible stimulation of the genitals, stimulus transmission via the pudendal nerve.
    - Psychogen: Cortical stimulation through visual, acoustic, and sensory stimuli or imagination, stimulus transmission via the spinal cord.
- Process
    1. Arterial Vasodilation
        - Fibers from the autonomous center in the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4 or S5: parasympathetic erection center) run through the inferior hypogastric plexus and cause arterial vasodilation.
            - Opening of the intimate cushions of the Aa. helicinae within the corpora cavernosa
            - Opening of the cavities of the corpora cavernosa for blood inflow
    2. Prevention of venous outflow
        - The tunica albuginea stretches and compresses the branches of the deep dorsal vein of the penis, which significantly increases the flow resistance.
        - The contracted Mm. ischiocavernosi compress the base (= Crura penis) of the corpora cavernosa and thus delay the venous return from the erectile tissue.
- Special Features
    - Corpus spongiosum is only venously congested (soft erection) to keep the lumen of the urethra open.
    - The erection is an autonomous process; however, a voluntary enhancement is only possible through the contraction of the ischiocavernous muscles.
    - Maintenance of an erection: Via reflex arc (nerve endings of the corpora cavernosa → pudendal nerve → erection center → pelvic splanchnic nerves → corpora cavernosa)
    - Nocturnal erections: An erection is usually triggered by sexual arousal but also occurs independently during the nocturnal REM sleep phases. The cause for this is not yet fully understood, but it is certainly dependent on androgens.

> [!NOTE]
> The parasympathetic fibers from the hypogastric plexus cause an NO-mediated vasodilation of the A. profunda and its branches. This fills the corpora cavernosa with blood, resulting in an erection!

> [!NOTE]
> During an erection, the pressure within the corpora cavernosa increases to up to 10 times the systolic blood pressure (around 1200 mmHg)!

## Ejaculation

The ejaculation occurs in three phases. Initially, with sustained sexual arousal, the stimulation of the sympathetic lumbar ejaculation center takes place. Subsequently, the secretion of the accessory sex glands is initiated (= emission). The temporal sequence of gland secretion during emission determines the formation of the three fractions of the ejaculate (see → ejaculate). The actual ejaculation is triggered musically.

1. Sympathetic ejaculation center: Stimulation of the autonomic center in the lumbar spinal cord (L2/L3) just before the orgasm phase.
2. Emission: Transport of semen and secretion from the sexual glands into the urethra
    - Prostate secretion↑
    - Ductus deferens: Conduit for semen into the urethra
    - Sebaceous gland secretion↑
3. Ejaculation
    - Bladder: Closure of the internal urethral sphincter muscle
    - Rhythmic contractions of the pelvic floor (mainly M. bulbospongiosus): Rapid transport of the ejaculate through the urethra to the external urethral orifice

> [!NOTE]
> The emission occurs sympathetically, the ejaculation partly sympathetically (ductus deferens), partly somatomotorily via the N. pudendus (M. bulbospongiosus)!

> [!NOTE]
> Point and Shoot: The erection (= Point) is regulated parasympathetically, the emission (= Shoot) is regulated sympathetically!

### Ejaculate (Semen)

The ejaculate consists of three components, referred to as fractions. Together, they result in an average ejaculation volume of approximately 3 mL.

- Fractions of the ejaculate
    1. Pre-fraction: Prostate secretion (whitish, liquid, acidic pH)
    2. Main fraction: Semen with spermatozoa (milky-white, gelatinous)
    3. Final fraction: Bladder gland secretion (yellowish, alkaline pH)
- Examination of the ejaculate (= spermogram)
    - Normal values:
        - Total sperm count: >39 million
        - Sperm concentration: >15 million/mL of ejaculate
        - Mobility
            - >40% motile sperm in the field of view (sperm categories PR + NP)
            - >32% progressive (moving forward) sperm in the field of view (sperm categories PR)
        - Vitality: >58% live sperm cells
        - Morphology: >4% with regular shape
        - Fructose: >13 μmol/L in seminal plasma
            - In case of humiliation: Indication of obstruction of the urinary tract or malfunction of the seminal vesicles
        - pH value: 7.2–8.0
            - >8.0 in case of inflammation of the prostate, seminal ducts, or reproductive glands
            - <7.2 in case of malfunction of the seminal vesicle or blockage of the ejaculatory ducts

> [!NOTE] Erectile dysfunction (formerly: impotence)
> If cohabitation over a longer period is not possible due to the absence of (sufficient) male erection, it is referred to as erectile dysfunction. It can have psychological (e.g., anxiety, dissatisfaction with the partnership) or physical (e.g., nerve injury from prostate surgery, vascular changes) causes. For diagnostics, a nocturnal tumescence measurement can be helpful. It records nocturnal erections and shows whether the penis is still capable of erection. Depending on the cause and after a thorough indication assessment, phosphodiesterase type V inhibitors (Viagra®) may be used, for example. These reduce the breakdown of cGMP, thereby achieving vasodilation in the erectile tissues through the release of nitric oxide (NO).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Penis, Erection, and Ejaculation
### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Penis

Describe the macroscopic anatomy of the penile corpora cavernosa and also address their arterial supply!
- The penis consists of two different erectile bodies: the paired corpora cavernosa as well as the corpus spongiosum surrounding the urethra. The deep artery of the penis (A. profunda penis) runs within the corpora cavernosa, supplying them arterially. The corpus spongiosum, whose distal parts form the erectile tissue of the glans penis, is supplied, together with the urethra running within it, via the bulb artery (A. bulbi penis).
### Sexual Arousal and Erection

Describe the process of male erection!
- The erection, that is the stiffening of the penis, is controlled parasympathetically as opposed to ejaculation and mainly occurs through blood filling the caverns of the corpora cavernosa. Initially, there is an NO-mediated vasodilation of the helicine arteries (Aa. helicinae), branches of the deep artery of the penis (A. profunda penis), which supply the corpora cavernosa, causing blood to flow into the caverns. As a result, the tunica albuginea surrounding the erectile body stretches, which in turn leads to compression of the draining veins. Due to the increased flow resistance, venous outflow from the corpora cavernosa decreases, the caverns fill with blood, and the penis stiffens.
For which sleep phase are nocturnal erections typical?
- Nocturnal erections are typical for the REM sleep phase, which is associated with particularly intense dreaming.
### Ejaculation

What is semen made of and what is the average ejaculation volume approximately?
- Besides the seminal fluid containing spermatozoa, the ejaculate mainly contains secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles. The average ejaculation volume is about 3 mL.
