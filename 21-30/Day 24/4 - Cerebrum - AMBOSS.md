# Cerebrum
## Summary

The cerebrum is a section of the brain consisting of billions of nerve cells that generates consciousness and cognitive abilities, among other things. Externally, the cerebrum is made up of two hemispheres, which are divided into four cerebral lobes by sulci (grooves). The lobes, in turn, are subdivided by further convolutions (gyri) and sulci. In a cross-section of the cerebrum, the cerebral cortex (the so-called "gray matter," consisting of nerve cell bodies) can be distinguished in the outer area, and below it lies the cerebral white matter (the so-called "white matter," consisting of myelinated axons). Embedded within the cerebral white matter are other core regions, including the so-called basal ganglia. The cerebral cortex can be divided into different areas based on phylogenetic, cytoarchitectural, and functional aspects. In contrast, the cerebral white matter is functionally defined particularly by various pathway systems and the basal ganglia.
## External Structure

### Profile

- Function: Seat of consciousness and cognitive abilities (including, among other things: language, somatosensory perception, emotions, memory, planning and execution of movements)
- Location: Fills the anterior and middle cranial fossa and is situated above the tentorium cerebelli.
- Shape: Walnut-shaped

### Striking Structures

The cerebrum consists of two hemispheres that are connected by the so-called corpus callosum. The surface of the cerebrum has convolutions (gyri) and grooves (sulci), which causes it to be highly folded. This allows for an increase in the surface area of the cerebrum without an increase in overall volume.

- Two hemispheres: Are separated by the longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum (interhemispheric fissure)
    - Each hemisphere can be divided into several cerebral lobes
    - Each hemisphere has three surfaces: a lateral surface, a medial surface, and a basal surface.
    - Mantle edge: Transition from the lateral to the medial hemisphere surface
- Important sulci
    - Lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure): Separates the temporal lobe from the frontal and parietal lobes
    - Central sulcus (Central sulcus): Separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe
    - Parietooccipital sulcus: Separates the parietal from the occipital lobe
    - Calcarine sulcus: Divides the medial surface of the occipital lobe horizontally into two halves
## Cerebral Lobes

The two brain hemispheres are divided into four cerebral lobes by sulci, to which discrete functions are often assigned. In reality, however, functional systems - such as motor skills or language - often extend across multiple and sometimes widely separated brain areas.

        - Causal-logical information processing
    - Right hemisphere responsible for:
        - Visual-spatial thinking

## Inner Structure

In cross-section, different areas can be delineated in the cerebrum. On the outside lies the cerebral cortex (Cortex cerebri), which contains billions of nerve cell bodies and is referred to as " gray matter". Inside is the cerebral white matter, which primarily contains myelinated axons and is referred to as " white matter". Embedded in the cerebral white matter (in the so-called white matter compartment) are core areas known as the basal ganglia.

### Classifications of the Cerebral Cortex

The cerebral cortex can be classified according to its connection principles, its developmental history (phylogenesis), or its cytoarchitecture.

#### Circuit Principles of Cortical Areas

Cortical areas are categorized (regardless of their specific function) according to similar connectivity principles.

- Primary cortex fields
    - Depending on the modality (sensory or motor): Interpretation-free sensory perception or direct control of voluntary motor skills.
    - Circuit principles
        - Sensory cortex areas
            - Receive unimodal afferents from the thalamus
            - Example: In the primary auditory cortex sounds are perceived, but not yet understood.
        - Motor cortex areas
            - Directly control the arbitrary motor skills
            - Example: Primary motor cortex: The majority of the fibers of the pyramidal tract originate here and directly control voluntary motor activity.
- Secondary cortical areas and association areas
    - Function: Linking different information modalities (= polymodal); are controlled by other cortical areas, but not by the thalamus
    - Localization: Near the primary cortex fields

#### Phylogenetic Classification

The cerebral cortex has both older and younger components from an evolutionary perspective. The phylogenetically younger areas of the cortex make up 90% of the cerebral cortex and, in contrast to older cortical areas, have a six-layered structure.

|Phylogenetic Age (from old to young)|   |Areas of the Cerebrum|Histological Layers|Functional Assignment|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Allokortex|Paleocortex|- Olfactory bulb<br>- Olfactory tract<br>- Cortex areas of the brain base|3–4|- Olfactory brain|
|Archikortex|- Hippocampus|- Limbic System|
|Neocortex|   |- Other cortical areas|6|- Higher cognitive abilities|

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to the neocortex, the allocortex has only 3–4 layers!

#### Brodmann classification

According to Brodmann, the cortex is divided into over 50 fields, known as Brodmann areas. This classification is based on cytoarchitectural differences of the respective areas. Since the structure of the areas is closely correlated with their function, discrete functions can be assigned to the Brodmann areas.

|Brodmann Area|Cortical Area|
|---|---|
|1-3|Primary Somatosensory Cortex|
|4|Primary Motor Cortex|
|6|Premotor Cortex and Supplementary Motor Cortex|
|8|Frontal Visual Field (Frontal Eye Center)|
|17|Primary Visual Cortex|
|18, 19|Secondary Visual Cortex|
|22|Sensory Language Center (Wernicke Area)|
|28, 34|Entorhinal Cortex|
|41|Primary Auditory Cortex|
|42|Sekundäre Hörrinde|
|44, 45|Motor Speech Center (Broca's Area)|

### Fine structure of the cerebral cortex

#### Neocortex

The neocortex consists of 6 layers of cells, organized into small functional units (so-called vertical columns). Each column encompasses all 6 cell layers and is oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. Within these layers, there are two important types of cells: pyramidal cells and non-pyramidal cells. They are arranged in a characteristic manner in their respective layers. However, depending on the function of the cortical area, the expression of the respective layers varies.

- Cell types
    - Pyramidal cells (and so-called modified pyramidal cells)
        - Definition: Very large multipolar neurons, which are the efferent projection neurons of the cortex.
        - Function
            - Receiving most afferents from the cortex with the dendritic tree
            - They form most of the efferent projection neurons of the cortex.
    - Non-pyramidal cells
        - Definition: Predominantly inhibitory interneurons

The pyramidal cells are the most important interfaces of the afferents and efferents of the cortex.

##### Layers of the Neocortex

One distinguishes six layers that are arranged horizontally on top of each other.

|From outside to inside|Layer|Content|Functional Assignment/Main Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|Molecular layer (Lamina molecularis)|Many nerve fibers, few nerve cells|Facilitate interaction between neurons of the other layers|
|II|Outer grain layer (Lamina granularis externa)|Many small cells|Cross-linking (horizontal) between the vertical columns and different cortex fields|
|III|Outer pyramidal layer (lamina pyramidalis externa)|Many small pyramidal cells|Forms cortico-cortical fiber connections to other cortical areas|
|IV|Inner granular layer (Lamina granularis interna)|Many small modified pyramidal cells|Main entry point: This is where most of the cortical afferents from the thalamus end.|
|V|Inner pyramidal layer (lamina pyramidalis interna)|Medium to large pyramidal cells|Main output: Axons form most of the cortical efferents to subcortical brain areas (Spinal cord, Brainstem, Basal ganglia)|
|VI|Multiform Layer (Lamina multiformis)|Different Cell Types|Projections to the Thalamus|

- Depending on the assigned functional area, the individual layers of the neocortex are developed to varying degrees:
    - Granular Cortex: Cortex areas with a strongly developed granular layer (IV) → Many incoming afferents → Especially in somatosensory cortex areas
    - Agranular cortex: Cortex areas with a well-developed pyramidal layer (V) → Many outgoing efferents → Especially in motor cortex areas

In the internal granular layer (Lamina granularis interna, IV), most (somatosensory) afferents of the cortex terminate! From the internal pyramidal layer (Lamina pyramidalis interna, V), most (motor) efferents of the cortex originate!

- Example pathways for cortical information flow:
    - When connected to the subcortical brain region: Input system → Inner granular layer (IV) → Inner pyramidal layer (V) → Output system
    - In cortico-cortical connections: Input system → Internal granule layer (IV) → External pyramidal layer (III) from cortical region X → External pyramidal layer (III) from cortical region Y → Internal pyramidal layer (V) → Output system

#### Allokortex

The allocortex is phylogenetically older than the neocortex. It consists of 3–4 layers of cells, which distinguishes it from the 6-layered neocortex.

- Shares
    - Archikortex: Involved in the development of the dentate gyrus and the hippocampus
    - Paleocortex: Involved in the formation of the olfactory brain (which includes, for example, the prepyriform cortex)
## Cerebral Cortex and Fiber Connections

The white matter is located beneath the cerebral cortex and consists of myelinated fiber connections. Depending on the fiber orientation, one distinguishes between commissural, association, or projection fibers.

- Commissural fibers
    - Definition: Connects cortical areas of both hemispheres
    - Examples
        - Corpus callosum (Balken)
            - Definition: Large, cross-connection made up of millions of fibers between functionally related areas of both hemispheres
            - Shares: Rostrum, Genu, Truncus, Splenium (from rostral to occipital)
        - Anterior commissure
            - Definition: Cross-connection between both temporal lobes
            - Location: Ventral of the 3rd ventricle
        - Commissure of the fornix
        - Posterior commissure
        - Habenular commissure
- Association fibers
    - Definition: Connect functionally related cortical areas within a hemisphere
    - Examples
        - Arcuate fibers of the cerebrum
        - Fibers of the telencephalic association
        - Cingulum
        - Arcuate fasciculus
- Projection fibers
    - Definition: Connects the cortex with subcortical structures
    - Examples
        - Corona radiata (internal capsule): Fan-shaped ascending and descending fibers that pass through the internal capsule
        - Hörstrahlung (Acoustic radiation)
        - Sehstrahlung (Optical radiation)

> [!NOTE] Split-Brain Operation
> In the split-brain operation, a surgical severance of the corpus callosum (callosotomy) is performed. Before the establishment of the seizure-suppressive therapy, this form of surgery was carried out as a last resort: In this case, the corpus callosum was severed to prevent the spread of epileptic seizures to the entire cerebral cortex. The risk of a secondarily generalized epileptic seizure can thus be significantly reduced. Even though callosotomy sounds like a far-reaching intervention in the functionality of the brain, it usually does not lead to relevant limitations in daily life.

> [!NOTE] Split-Brain-Patient
> In split-brain patients, the corpus callosum is severed, for example, due to surgery (e.g., callosotomy) or a brain tumor. Since important connections between both hemispheres are missing due to commissural fibers, very characteristic neurophysiological phenomena arise. One of these phenomena is confabulation: confabulations are invented, objectively false statements that patients with cerebral lesions unconsciously use to fill gaps in memory or knowledge. In doing so, the affected individuals believe the statements to be true, even though the same gap is filled with different content each time. Due to the lack of connection between the two hemispheres via the commissural fibers in split-brain patients, both hemispheres can no longer communicate with each other (so-called hemispheric lateralization effects). If, for instance, an image of a tree is presented to the right hemisphere, the left hand will select the corresponding image of a leaf. However, if a different image (e.g., a stove) is presented to the left hemisphere, the split-brain patient will then select a corresponding image (e.g., an image of a pot) with the right hand. If the subject is then asked why they chose the image of the leaf, confabulations occur, as the left hemisphere, which is responsible for language, does not know what the right hemisphere has done.

## Subcortical Nuclei

The subcortical nuclei include the basal ganglia and other smaller nuclear areas such as the claustrum and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. These nuclear areas are located within the white matter of the cerebrum (cerebral white matter) and are partially integrated into the complex circuits of the motor system.

1. Basal ganglia
    - Striatum: Caudate nucleus and Putamen
    - Pallidum (Globus pallidus)
    - Substantia nigra
    - Ncl. subthalamicus
2. Further subcortical nuclei
    - Amygdaloid body
    - Ncl. basalis (Meynert)
    - Claustrum

### Basal Ganglia (Striatal Ganglia)

The basal ganglia include nuclei that are located both within (striatum and pallidum) and outside of the cerebrum (subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra). As part of the motor system, they control among other things the initiation, extent, direction, force, and speed of movements.

| |   |Structure|Location|
|---|---|---|---|
|Striatum|Nucleus caudatus|- Shape: C-shaped<br>- Parts: Head, Body, Tail|- Surrounds the Putamen in a tail-like manner<br>- Runs along the lateral wall of the Lateral ventricle|
|Putamen|- Shape: Oval Disc|- Between Pallidum and the so-called Claustrum|
|Pallidum|   |- Shape: Conical<br>- Components<br>    - Medial Pallidum Segment<br>    - Lateral Pallidum Segment|- Medial to the Putamen|
|Substantia nigra|   |- Form: oval|- Tegmentum mesencephali|
|Ncl. subthalamicus|   |- Shape: biconvex, lens-shaped|- Subthalamus|

#### Functional Anatomy of the Basal Ganglia: Basal Ganglia Loop

The basal ganglia are interconnected through complex regulatory loops. In addition to a “main flow” of movement information, there are several modulating subsidiary loops. This form of feedback information processing allows for precise fine-tuning of movement sequences.

- Striatum (GABA): Main entrance of the basal ganglia
    - Two shares
        - Caudate nucleus
        - Putamen
    - Two connection paths
        1. Direct pathway: Inhibits the medial pallidum segment (Transmitter: GABA, Substance P) → Motor-promoting part of the Striatum (this part of the Striatum primarily has D1 receptors and can be activated via Dopamine)
        2. Indirect pathway: Inhibits the lateral pallidum segment (Transmitter: GABA) → Motor-inhibitory part of the striatum (this part of the striatum predominantly possesses D2 receptors and can be inhibited by dopamine)
- Pallidum
    - Medial pallidum segment (GABA): Main output of the basal ganglia → Inhibits the thalamus and thus the activation of the motor cortex → Motor-inhibiting part of the pallidum
    - Lateral Pallidum segment (GABA): Part of a motor-modulating indirect pathway → Inhibits the subthalamic nucleus → Motor-facilitating part of the pallidum
- Substantia nigra
    - Substantia nigra (Pars compacta) (Dopamine): Promoting motor function
        1. Activates with some fibers the part of the striatum that promotes motor activity.
        2. Inhibits the portion of the striatum that suppresses motor signals
    - Substantia nigra (Pars reticularis) (GABA): Acts like the medial segment of the globus pallidus: main output station of the basal ganglia. Inhibits the thalamus and thus the activation of the motor cortex.
- Ncl. subthalamicus (Glutamate): Part of a motor-modulating indirect pathway: Excites the medial pallidum segment and the substantia nigra pars reticularis.
- Thalamic nuclei (ventral nuclear group VA/VL) (Glutamate): Excite motor cortex areas

> [!NOTE]
> The structural and functional anatomy of the basal ganglia are not identical! For example, the striatum can be functionally divided into a motor-inhibiting and a motor-facilitating component. These two functions are not strictly assigned to one of the components of the striatum, but are mediated by both the caudate nucleus and the putamen!

> [!NOTE]
> The substantia nigra (pars compacta) inhibits the dopaminergic so-called motor-inhibiting component of the striatum. Through this "disinhibition," it thus acts to promote motor activity!

##### Information flow

- Main flow of the basal ganglia loop: Movement drive (arises in the association cortex) → Striatum → Pallidum → Thalamus (ventral thalamic nuclei) → Motor cortex areas
- Secondary loops
    - Movement drive (arises in the association cortex) → Striatum → Substantia nigra (Pars compacta) → Striatum→ Pallidum→ Thalamus (Ventral nuclei of the thalamus) → Motor cortex areas
    - Movement drive (originates in the association cortex) → Striatum → Lateral Pallidum segment → Subthalamic nucleus → Medial Pallidum segment → Thalamus (ventral nuclei of the thalamus) → Motor cortex areas

> [!NOTE] Hemiballismus
> Unilateral damage to the subthalamic nucleus leads to what is known as hemiballismus. This basal ganglia disorder is characterized by sudden and involuntary flinging movements of the limbs.

> [!NOTE] Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra  
> The symptom triad of Parkinson's disease is mainly caused by degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. It typically leads to rigidity (increased muscle tone), tremor (shaking), and akinesia (poverty of movement). In the face, akinesia can manifest, among other things, as a reduction in facial expressions (so-called hypomimia), which can make the face appear mask-like. The neurophysiological foundations are not yet fully understood (see also: Parkinson's disease).

#### Capsules of the Basal Ganglia

Through the internal capsule, most afferent and efferent pathways of the cortex pass. In the horizontal section, it forms a laterally open angle.

| |   |Location|Content|   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Descending tracks|Ascending tracks|
|---|---|
|Internal capsule|Anterior limb (Crus anterius)|- Between the head of the caudate nucleus and Pallidum|- Frontopontine tract|- Anterior thalamic stem|
|Knee (Genu of the internal capsule)|- Connects the anterior and posterior limbs|- Corticobulbar tract||
|Posterior Limb (Crus posterius)|- Between Thalamus and Pallidum|- Pyramidal Tract: Course in somatotopic organization<br>- Temporopontine Tract|- Upper Thalamic Peduncle<br>- Posterior Thalamic Peduncle<br>- Visual and Auditory Radiation|
|External capsule|   |- Between Putamen and Claustrum|- Association fibers|   |
|Extreme capsule|   |- Between claustrum and insular cortex|- Association fibers|   |

## Review Questions on the Chapter Cerebrum
### Outer Structure

What impact can damage to the frontal lobe have?
- A large part of the motor cortex areas for voluntary and speech motor functions (motor speech center = Broca's area) are located in the frontal lobe, which lead to corresponding deficits when damaged. In addition, the prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher cognitive functions. Consequently, damage leads, for example, to loss of decision-making ability and the ability to estimate the consequences of one's own actions.

What structure can be found deep in the lateral sulcus?
- Deep in the lateral sulcus – hidden by the frontal, parietal, and temporal opercula – is the insular lobe.

What responsibilities do the right and left hemispheres have in most right-handed individuals?
- In right-handers, the left hemisphere is usually the dominant hemisphere. It is responsible for logical thinking, language comprehension and production, as well as fine motor skills. In contrast, the right, non-dominant hemisphere is responsible for creativity, spatial thinking, and emotional language content.

### Inner Structure

Which layer of the neocortex receives the most afferents and from which layer do the most efferents originate?
- Most cortical afferents end in the internal granular layer (Lamina granularis interna, IV); accordingly, it is especially well-developed in somatosensory cortical areas. Most cortical efferents originate from the internal pyramidal layer (Lamina pyramidalis interna, V); it is thus especially prominent in motor cortical areas.

What is the function of the corpus callosum?
- The corpus callosum connects functionally related areas of both hemispheres as a commissural pathway, thus enabling communication between the two halves of the brain.

What are the consequences of a sectioning of the corpus callosum?
- If the corpus callosum is surgically severed, for example as a therapeutic attempt in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy to prevent secondary generalization of an epileptic seizure, the hemispheres lose their ability to communicate. A typical phenomenon of these so-called "split-brain patients" is confabulation, where patients unconsciously fill gaps in memory with fabricated, objectively false statements which they believe to be true.

Name the core areas that are counted among the basal ganglia as well as their location relative to each other!
- The basal ganglia include the striatum with the nucleus caudatus and putamen as well as the pallidum. The striatum and pallidum lie within the cerebrum. Functionally, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus are also counted among the basal ganglia, but topographically they are not part of the cerebrum. The nucleus caudatus lies lateral to the lateral ventricle and thus arches around the putamen in a bow shape. Medial to the putamen, and thus located furthest inward, is the pallidum.

How does the striatum communicate with the pallidum?
- The striatum has two inhibitory pathways to the pallidum. On the one hand, it can promote motor activity by inhibiting the motor-inhibiting medial pallidum with GABA/substance P. On the other hand, the striatum has a motor-inhibitory effect via GABAergic inhibition of the lateral pallidum segment.

Which dopamine receptors are found in the striatum? How do they work?
- The neurons in the striatum have both D1 and D2 receptors. D1 receptors are mainly found in the motor-promoting part of the striatum and are activated when dopamine binds to them. In the motor-inhibitory part, D2 receptors predominate.

What influence does the pars compacta of the substantia nigra have on motor skills?
- The pars compacta of the substantia nigra promotes motor activity via two dopamine-mediated pathways: it excites the motor-promoting part of the striatum and inhibits the motor-inhibitory part of the striatum. The latter corresponds to a disinhibition of motor activity, which thus also promotes motor function.

Name the functions of the amygdala!
- The amygdala is the center for mediating and processing emotions. Especially important are fear reactions and conditioning, recognition of emotional facial expressions, integration of emotionally charged memory contents, as well as influencing vegetative functions.

Which is the most important efferent of the amygdala? With which structure does the amygdala connect?
- The most important efferent of the amygdala is the stria terminalis. The stria terminalis connects the amygdala with the diencephalon, especially with the hypothalamus. It influences vegetative reactions based on experienced and emotionally charged experiences.

How is the subthalamic nucleus integrated into the basal ganglia circuitry?
- The subthalamic nucleus acts excitatory via the neurotransmitter glutamate on the medial part of the pallidum as well as the substantia nigra pars reticularis.

How does a lesion of the subthalamic nucleus present clinically?
- Damage to the subthalamic nucleus (e.g., due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery) leads to sudden and involuntary flinging movements of the limbs on the opposite side. This extrapyramidal motor disorder is called hemiballismus.

Through which pathological change do the symptoms occur in Parkinson's disease? Name the classic triad!
- The typical Parkinson's symptoms rigidity, tremor, and akinesia are caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. This results in reduced dopamine release in the striatum, so that inhibitory components of the striatum on motor function predominate.

Name the different sections of the internal capsule with the descending pathways that run through them!
- The internal capsule can be divided into the anterior limb (crus anterius), the genu (genu capsulae internae), and the posterior limb (crus posterius). In the anterior limb runs the frontopontine tract, in the genu the corticobulbar tract, and in the posterior limb the pyramidal tract as well as the temporopontine tract.
