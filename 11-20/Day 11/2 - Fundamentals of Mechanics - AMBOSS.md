# Fundamentals of Mechanics
## Summary

Mechanics is the study of the motion of bodies and the forces that trigger this motion. In addition to linear and circular motion of rigid bodies, this also includes the "motions" of deformable bodies, i.e., their deformation. A particularly important quantity in this context is pressure, which is therefore described separately in connection with the density of materials and hydrostatic pressure. For all motions, the characteristic properties are described, the triggering forces, and the work done or power generated by these forces. The presented concepts are further explored through individual concrete applications such as the pendulum or the centrifuge.

The goal of physics is to model and make processes predictable using a few simple equations. The most important equations of mechanics that a medical professional may encounter are compiled in the following sections and illustrated with simple calculation examples. For practical use, it is sufficient to know only the respective basic formulas, which can then be easily rearranged or substituted. If difficulties arise here, the fundamentals of arithmetic will be helpful.

## Fundamentals of Forces

### Newton's Laws of Classical Mechanics

Classical mechanics is based on the physicist Newton, who formulated three important laws for motions and their causes:

- 1. Newton's First Law: An object remains at rest (or in uniform, straight-line motion) unless acted upon by external forces.
- 2. Newton's Second Law: Every change in motion is proportional to the force applied and occurs in the direction of the applied force.
- 3. Newton's Third Law: Forces always occur in pairs: If body 1 exerts a force on another body 2 (action), then a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction is exerted by body 2 on body 1 (reaction).

### Superposition of Forces

Newton formulates what is known as the principle of superposition for the forces he describes: When more than one force acts on a body, the forces add up to a total force. It must be taken into account that forces are mathematically vectors, meaning that in addition to their magnitude, their direction also plays a role. For simplicity, all calculations will be presented without vector notation in the following. Nevertheless, the properties of force vectors will be illustrated here through simple graphical representation:

|Direction of Force|Formula|Vector Representation|
|---|---|---|
|Same Direction|Fges = F1 + F2||
|Opposite Direction|Fges = F1 - F2||
|Different Directions|Fges = F1 + F2||
## Movement of Bodies

Movement is the change of the spatial position of a body through a force. Bodies can be accelerated or decelerated during a movement. There are two types of movement: linear movement, called translation, and rotational movement. There are some parallels between the two. One way to transfer such a moving force from one body to another is through a collision. This force impact transfers a "momentum," which is referred to as "impulse" in physics. Since the impulse goes in a certain direction, it is also a vector quantity.

- Kraft: Sets motion in motion → Accelerates a body depending on its mass more strongly or less strongly
    - Formula: F = m × a
        - Unit: N (Newton); N can also be written as (kg × m)/s²
        - F = Force, m = Mass, a = Acceleration
- Weight force: The weight force that pulls an object towards the Earth is proportional to the mass of the object and the acceleration due to gravity g (= 9.81 m/s²)
    - Formula: G = m × g
        - Unit: N (Newton)
        - G = gravity, m = mass, g = acceleration due to gravity (= 9.81 m/s²)
- Momentum: Describes the "amount of motion" of a body with mass.
    - Formula: p = m × v
        - Unit: Ns (Newton-seconds)
        - p = momentum, m = mass, v = velocity
- Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum in a closed system always remains constant!
    - Example: In a rear-end collision, the colliding car is braked and the front car is pushed forward, the braking impulse on the rear car is equal to the pushing impulse on the front car.
- Collision: When two bodies exchange momentum, it is called a collision.
    - Elastic collision: Collision in which an initially occurring deformation completely returns to its original state.
    - Inelastic collision: Collision in which a permanent deformation occurs

> [!NOTE]
> What is referred to in everyday language as the "weight" of an object is actually a force – the gravitational force, which is generated by the Earth's attraction that accelerates every body toward the center of the Earth. It is therefore not an inherent property of the body but varies depending on where the body is located within the Earth's gravitational field! It should not be confused with mass, which is indeed an intrinsic property of a body and a measure of how strongly it resists acceleration (inertia)!

> [!NOTE]
> Conservation of momentum: In a system that does not exchange interactions with its surroundings (isolated system), the sum of all momenta must always remain constant!

###### Example Calculation

A metal sphere with a mass of 5 kg is to be accelerated to a speed of 20 km/h within 3 seconds. What force is necessary for that?

- Wanted: Force F
- Given: mass m, velocity v, time interval Δt,
    - 20 km/h = 20000 m/h = 5.56 m/s
    - a = Δv / Δt = 5.56m/s / 3s = 1.85m/s²
    - F = m × a = > 5kg × 1.85m/s² = 9.3N

### Mathematical Description

- Speed: Is a measure of the distance covered by a moving object per unit of time.
    - Formula: v = s / t
        - Unit: m/s
        - v = speed, s = distance, t = time
        - The vector of velocity runs at:
            - Linear motion: In the same direction as the movement (the vector lies on the line)
            - Curved motion: As a tangent at the point of interest on the curve and vector shows the direction in which the motion is headed.
    - Special case of free fall: Neglecting frictional forces, the speed of a body in free fall can be calculated using the gravitational acceleration g.
        - Formula: v = g × t
        - v = speed, g = gravitational acceleration (= 9.81 m/s2), t = time
- Acceleration: Change in velocity that a body experiences, for example, through a force.
    - Formula: a = Δv / Δt
        - Unit: m/s²
        - a = acceleration, Δv = change in velocity, Δt = change in time
        - The vector of acceleration always points in the same direction as the vector of the total force acting on the body.
    - Special case uniform acceleration: If a body is uniformly accelerated all the time, the acceleration can be calculated particularly easily.
        - Distance-Time Law without Initial Velocity: s = ½ a × t2
        - Formula for acceleration without initial velocity: a = v / t
        - For uniform acceleration from rest or to a stop, the following applies: a = v2 / (2 × s)
            - Unit: m/s²
            - a = acceleration, v = velocity, t = time, s = distance

### Graphical Representation – Distance/Time Diagram

Graphically, translation movements can be represented in a so-called distance/time diagram (y-axis: distance or path s [in m]; x-axis: time t [in s]), from which many pieces of information can be directly read:

- Types of movement and their curve profiles in the distance/time diagram
    - Rest mass: Curve runs parallel to the x-axis
    - Uniformly moving mass: Ascending (or descending) line
    - Uniformly accelerated mass: Parabolic trajectory
- Readable sizes in the path/time diagram
    - Speed: Slope of the graph in the distance/time diagram
    - Average speed: Determination of speed using the total distance and the total time taken.
        - Uniform motion: (Linear progression in the distance/time graph) Here, the average speed is also the actual speed.
            - The acceleration of this movement is = 0
        - Non-uniform motion: The speed varies over the entire observation period, so the actual speed is sometimes greater and sometimes less than the average speed.
            - Movements that accelerate, experience an acceleration with a positive sign; movements that slow down (i.e., are decelerated), experience an acceleration with a negative sign.

## Rotational Motion

A rotation (also called a turning) is the movement of a body around an axis of rotation. Much of what is already known from simple translational motion (see above) can be transferred to rotational motion. Important relationships in which rotational movements play a role are the beam balance, the lever, and the centrifuge (see below).

- Torque: Rotation with a specific radius that results from a driving force.
- Formula: M = r × F
    - Unit: Nm (Newtonmeter)
    - M = Torque, r = Radius of rotation, F = Force
- The torque is perpendicular to the force vector!
- RPM: Number of revolutions per unit of time
    - Formula: n = ΔN / Δt
        - Unit: 1/s
        - n = rotational speed, ΔN = number of rotations, Δt = duration
- Rotational power: Power that must be provided to rotate an object
    - Formula: P = M × 2π × n
        - Unit: W (Watt)
        - P = power, M = torque, n = rotational speed
- Angular momentum: "Magnitude" or "spin" that an object exhibits during a rotational motion.
    - Formula: L = I × ω
        - Unit: kg×m2/s
        - L = angular momentum, I = moment of inertia, ω = angular velocity
- Focus: Center of Mass
    - If a body is suspended in a rotatable manner at a point, then its position settles in such a way that the suspension point, the center of mass of the body, and the center of the Earth are aligned in a straight line.

## Periodic Movements: Vibrations

Both translational and rotational movements can periodically repeat – think of pendulums or springs. Such periodic phenomena are called vibrations. Vibrations that spread out spatially are called waves. Vibrations are described using the sine function. The maximum displacement of the vibration is also called amplitude.

- Harmonic oscillation: Periodic displacement of an object or a wave without energy loss.
    - Formula: s = s0 × sin(2πt / T) = s0 × sin(ωt)
        - The angle of the oscillatory motion is usually specified in physics using the → radian measure.
    - Important sizes
        - Amplitude (s0): Maximum displacement of the oscillation
        - Oscillation period (T): The time required for a complete oscillation
        - Frequency (1/T): Number of complete oscillations per second
            - Unit: Hertz (Hz) = 1 vibration per second
        - In advancing waves:
            - Wavelength (λ): Distance that the wave travels during one oscillation (see also: Optics and optical devices)
            - For waves, the transmitted energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude (E∼A2)
        - Example calculation: See thread pendulum (→ pendulum)

## Energy, Work, Power

Every movement requires energy to be expended, which is also quantified as "work" (work = amount of energy converted in a process). If work is to be related to the time period in which it is performed, the quantity used is "power."

### Energy

Every form of energy can be converted into other forms of energy. Examples of such transformations are friction (kinetic energy → heat energy) and the pendulum (kinetic energy → potential energy).

- Kinetic energy: energy of motion, i.e., the energy contained in the movement of a body
    - Formula: Ekin = ½ × m × v2
        - Unit: Nm
        - Ekin = Kinetic Energy, m = Mass, v = Velocity
- Potential Energy: The energy of a body that arises from its position in the gravitational force field.
    - Formula: Epot = m × g × h
        - Unit: Nm
        - Epot = Potential Energy, m = Mass, g = Gravitational Acceleration (= 9.81 m/s²), h = Height of Displacement
- Thermal energy: Energy that is stored in the microscopic movement of the particles (Brownian molecular motion, see also: Thermodynamics) that make up a body.
- Friction: The inhibition of motion that occurs when matter comes into contact, as kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy.
    - Internal friction: Occurs between particles within the same medium
    - External friction: Occurs at the interface between two media
        - Sliding friction: Frictional force that opposes the movement when pushing or pulling an object.
        - Static friction: Frictional force that must be overcome for a previously stationary object to move from its position.

### Work

Work is the amount of energy that must be expended during a process. Here, two important forms of work in relation to the movement of bodies are introduced: lifting work and acceleration work:

- Lifting work: If a body is to be lifted, lifting work (= weight × lifting height) must be done, which counters the force of gravity.
    - Formula: W = G × h
        - Unit: J (Joule)
        - W = Work, G = Gravitational force, h = Height
- Acceleration work: Work that is done to accelerate an object to a certain speed.
    - Formula: W = m × a × s (= F × s)
        - Unit: J (Joule) = Nm (Newton meter) = Ws (Watt second)
        - W = Work of acceleration, m = Mass of the accelerated body, a = Acceleration, s = Distance, (F = Force)

###### Example Calculation

To lift a stone weighing 2 kg to a height of 2 m, what lifting work is done?

- Wanted: Hub work W
- Given: mass m, lift height h
    - G = m × g => G = 2 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 19.62 N
    - W = G × h => 19.62 N × 2 m = 39.24 J

### Performance

With the help of mechanical forces, energy can be transferred to a body in the form of work. To specify the dynamics of work, power is defined:

- Power: Energy per unit of time or work done per unit of time
    - Formula: P = W / Δt
        - Unit: W (Watt, = J/s)
        - P = Power, W = Energy or mechanical work, t = Time
    - Formula: P = F × v
        - Unit: W (Watt, = J/s = Nm/s)
        - P = Power, F = Force, v = Speed

###### Example Calculation

To lift a stone to a height of 0.5m within 5 minutes, a force of 3N must be applied. What power is generated in the process?

- Sought: Performance P
- Given: Time t, Height h, Force F
    - W = F × h => 3 N × 0.5 m = 1.5 J
    - => P = W / Δt => 1.5 J / 300 s = 0.005 W

## Deformation of Bodies

Forces acting on a body can lead to a deformation of that body. Deformations such as buckling, bending, shearing (i.e., shifting of layers against each other), or torsion (i.e., twisting) are well-known from everyday life. The most important and simplest phenomena are stretching and compression. In the state of stretching or compression, the body stores energy (namely, the energy transferred to the body by the force responsible for the change in length). The simplest example of such a deformation is the spring pendulum.

- Length change: Increase or decrease in the length of an object
    - Formula: ε = Δl/l
        - ε = strain, Δl = change in length, l = original length
    - In the case of the spring pendulum, this corresponds, for example, to the change in length of the spring.
    - Stretching: Increase in length
        - Medical example: dilation of blood vessels (see also: vascular compliance)
    - Compression: Reduction of length
- Hooke's Law: Describes the elastic deformation of a body proportional to the applied force (linear-elastic behavior)
    - Formula: F = E × A × ε
        - F = tensile force, ε = strain, E = modulus of elasticity, A = cross-sectional area
    - With Hooke's Law, for example, the extension of a spring can be calculated when it is pulled apart with a certain force.
    - If it is known how far a spring is stretched, this law can also be used to calculate what force is stored in the spring.
- Modulus of Elasticity: Material property; describes the behavior of a material under deformation as the resulting stress in relation to the observed strain.
    - Formula: E = σ / ε
        - Unit: N/m2
        - E = modulus of elasticity, σ = stress [N/m2], ε = strain
- Tensile stress: Stress that arises in an object due to the resistance to deformation when it is stretched.
    - Formula: σ = F / A
        - Unit: N/m2
        - σ = tensile stress, F = tensile force, A = cross-sectional area
- Spring energy: Energy stored in a stretched spring.
    - Formula: E = ½ D × s2
        - Unit: J (Joule)
        - E = Energy, D = Spring constant [N/m], s = Displacement [m]
        - The spring constant indicates the hardness or stiffness of a spring and is approximately a constant. Its magnitude depends on the shape and material of the spring.

###### Calculation example

On a 60cm long rubber band with a cross-sectional area of 2cm², a force of 1N is applied. What is the tension that the rubber band is under? If the rubber band stretches by 5cm due to the force, what is its modulus of elasticity?

- Sought: Stress σ, Modulus of Elasticity E
- Given: Length l, Cross-sectional area A, Tensile force F, Change in length Δl
    - σ = F/A => σ = 1N / 0.0002m2 = 5000N/m2
    - ε = Δl/l => ε = 5cm / 60cm
    - E = σ/ε => E = 5000N/m2 / (5/60) = 60000N/m2

## Hydrostatics

Besides mass, there is another inherent property of bodies: density. This connects the mass of the body to its volume. Density plays an important role, especially for liquids. If one knows its density, one can calculate the buoyancy of any object floating in the liquid using the hydrostatic pressure (or also gravitational pressure). At the same time, one can also determine the density of any object if one knows the volume of water it displaces.

- Density: Indicates the relationship of the mass of a body to its volume and, simply put, states how closely packed ("dense") the atoms are in a material and how "heavy" they are (essentially attributed to the number of nucleons in the nucleus).
    - Formula: ρ = m / V
        - Unit: g / L
        - ρ = density, m = mass, V = volume
        - The density of water is 1 kg/L.
- Pressure (Physics): Results from a force F acting on a specific area A
    - Formula: p = F / A
    - Unit: Pa (Pascal = N/m2 = kg/(m×s2))
        - mmHg (lies: Millimeter of mercury; is an old unit of pressure that is still often used in medicine, particularly in blood pressure measurement; 1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa)
        - cmH2O (means: Centimeter of water column; an old unit of pressure that is still widely used in ventilators; 1 cmH2O ≈ 1 hPa = 100 Pa)
        - p = Pressure, F = Force, A = Area (on which the force acts)
- Volume work: Amount of energy that must be expended when changing the volume of a body
    - Formula: W = p × V
        - Unit: J (Joule)
        - W = Work, p = Pressure, V = Volume
- Hydrostatic pressure: Also "weight pressure"; this is the pressure that arises from gravity in a liquid.
    - Formula: p = ρLiquid × g × h
        - Unit: Pa (Pascal)
        - p = pressure, ρFlüssigkeit = density of the liquid, VKörper = volume of the body, g = acceleration due to gravity, h = depth
- Buoyancy: Force that acts on a (floating) body in the direction of the surface of a liquid.
    - Formula: FA = GFluid = mFluid × g = ρFluid × VBody × g
        - Unit: N (Newton)
        - FA = buoyant force, GFlüssigkeit = weight force exerted by the liquid, mFlüssigkeit = mass of the displaced liquid, g = acceleration due to gravity, ρFlüssigkeit = density of the liquid, VKörper = volume of the body

> [!NOTE] Measurement of central venous pressure
> There is a trick to measure the central venous pressure, that is, the pressure in the large veins before the right heart, without any tools: It takes advantage of the fact that the well-visible right external jugular vein (V. jugularis externa dextra) stands approximately vertically above the superior vena cava (V. cava superior). In a sitting patient, the blood in it stands like a column of water above the heart and thus acts as a natural manometer. However, the external jugular vein is not visible in a healthy person when sitting without artificial pressure increase (e.g., through a Valsalva maneuver), whereas when lying down and to a certain degree of elevation, it is visible. The point at which the boundary of the blood column is seen is taken as the reference point in the clinical assessment of central venous pressure (ZVD). When the heart contracts, the pressure varies slightly, which can be observed as pulsation on the skin. The central venous pressure in cmH2O approximately corresponds to the number of centimeters between the pulsation and the estimated height of the heart.

## Application Examples

### Balance Scale (Example of Rotational Movement)

A balance scale consists of a horizontal beam that is pivotally attached at its center of gravity. At both ends of the beam, there are pans that can be loaded.

- mlinks = mrechts: Both bowls are at the same height.
- mlinks ≠ mrechts: The beam tilts towards the side with the higher load.

### Lever (Example Rotational Movement)

A lever is a rigid body (e.g., a beam) that is pivotally attached at a point (the so-called fulcrum). Mathematically, a lever in its resting position can be described using the lever law, which was formulated in ancient times.

- Lever law: A lever is in equilibrium when the sum of all moments in one direction is equal to the sum of all moments (M = r × F, details above) in the opposite direction. The moments are calculated by multiplying the force by the length of the lever arm.
    - Formula: Force [N] × Lever Arm [m] = Load [N] × Load Arm [m]

###### Example Calculation

- Sought: Force that a muscle must exert to hold a load
- Given: The muscle is 1 cm away from the joint center, the load weighs 100 g, and is 30 cm away from the joint.
    - Weight force G = m × g with g = gravitational acceleration (= 9.81 m/s2) → 0.1 kg × 10 m/s2 = 1 N
    - Force × Force arm = Load × Load arm → Force × 0.01 m = 1 N × 0.3 m
    - Force = 1 N × 0.3 m / 0.01 m = 30 N

### Centrifuge (Example of Rotational Motion)

A centrifuge is a device used to separate mixtures of substances such as emulsions and suspensions (definition and explanation see: substances and mixtures) by utilizing the different inertial moments of the components of the mixture. For this purpose, the sample is quickly accelerated in a circular motion. In this process, a centrifugal force acts, which is called centrifugal force and is perpendicular to the tangent of the circular motion, pointing outward from the center of the circle. Therefore, all components of the sample slowly move to the bottom of the sample container - the higher the density of the component, the faster the so-called sedimentation of the particles occurs.

- Centrifugal force: Also called "centrifugal force," it is the force that pushes you outward, for example, in a rapidly spinning carousel.
    - Formula: Fz = m × az = m × v2/r = m × r × ω2
        - Unit: N
        - Fz = centripetal force, az = centripetal acceleration, m = mass, v = orbital speed/radial speed, r = radius, ω = angular velocity (= 2 × π × f)
        - The centrifugal force is a so-called fictitious force, meaning a force that is theoretically assumed to explain an observed motion. Fictitious forces include all inertial forces.
- Centripetal force: Force that accelerates an object in rotational motion toward the center of the circular movement. The centripetal force ensures that a motion actually follows a circular path. Its magnitude depends on the velocity of the object and the curvature of the circle.
- Centripetal acceleration: Acceleration of the centripetal force
    - Formula: az = v2/r = ω2 × r
        - Unit: m/s²
        - az = centripetal acceleration, v = orbital speed/radial speed, r = radius, ω = angular velocity
- Speed: Indicates the number of revolutions per unit of time.
    - Formula: n = 1 / T
        - Unit: Revolutions per minute (1/min)
        - n = rotational speed, 1/T = frequency of the rotation
- Sedimentation constant: The sedimentation rate of each particle depends on the centrifugal force of the centrifuge. If one wants to compare the sedimentation rates of particles, it is therefore useful to "calculate out" the centrifugal acceleration – this results in the sedimentation constant.
    - Formula: sk = vs / az
        - Unit: S (Svedberg; 1S = 10^-13 s)
        - sk = sedimentation constant, vs = sedimentation velocity, az = centripetal acceleration

> [!NOTE]
> Substances with high density settle faster and further in the centrifuge than substances with low density!

###### Example Calculation

Two proteins with sedimentation constants of 1S and 4S are to be separated from each other in a centrifuge. What are their respective sedimentation velocities if the centrifuge has a radius of 15 cm and rotates at a speed of 5000/min?

- Sought: Sedimentation rates vs
- Given: Sedimentation constants sk, radius r, rotational speed n
    - 5000 revolutions per minute correspond to approximately 83 revolutions per second
    - Train speed v = Arc length s / Time t
    - For the arc length, we take a full rotation, for which the following holds: s = 2π × r
    - → v = 83 × 2π × 0.15 m / 1s = 78.2 m/s
    - Centripetal acceleration az = v2 / r => az = 78.22 m²/s² / 0.15 m = 40768 m/s²
    - Sedimentation velocity vs = sk × az
    - For protein 1: vs = 1 S × 40768 m/s2 = 4.0768 × 10-9 m/s
    - For protein 2: vs = 4 S × 40768 m/s² = 16.307 × 10⁻⁹ m/s

### Pendulum (Example of Energy Conversion)

A pendulum is a body that is freely suspended and swings. This also includes springs, which do not swing from side to side, but from top to bottom. In its resting position, the pendulum hangs vertically downward from its attachment (corresponding to its center of mass). When energy is supplied to this pendulum by "displacing" it, i.e., moving it from the resting position to another position, it gains potential energy. Upon release, the pendulum automatically swings back toward the resting position, becoming faster in the process and thereby increasing its kinetic energy. However, if the pendulum shoots past the resting position, the movement slows down again, but the potential energy of the body increases once more. The two states of the pendulum during its motion can be described as follows:

- Law of Conservation of Energy: The total energy in a closed system always remains constant!
- Undamped vibration: Ideal vibration that obeys the law of conservation of energy.
    - Formula: Ekin + Epot = constant
- Damped vibration: Vibration that gradually decreases over time because energy is "lost" through friction (i.e., transformed into heat).
    - All macroscopic vibrations in physics are damped.

|Extreme positions of the pendulum|Potential Energy|Kinetic Energy|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|
|Maximum Displacement|Eges|0|- Total energy is stored as potential energy|
|Passing through the rest position|0|Eges|- Total energy is converted into kinetic energy<br>- => The speed is maximal here|

### U-tube Manometer

A measuring device that utilizes hydrostatic pressure is the so-called U-tube manometer. This is a pressure measuring instrument consisting of a U-shaped bent glass tube that is partially filled with liquid. When both sides of the U-tube manometer are open, the ambient pressure can act on both sides of the liquid. If one side of the manometer is connected to a container whose pressure is to be measured, the liquid column in the manometer shifts:

- Pressure in the container < Ambient pressure: The column of liquid moves towards the container until the pressure is balanced.
- Pressure in the container > Ambient pressure: The column of liquid moves away from the container until the pressure is balanced.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Fundamentals of Mechanics
### Movement of Bodies

What is a force and how is it generally calculated?
- A force is an influence on a body that can move or deform it. Not only the magnitude of the influence must be considered, but also the direction in which it occurs. Mathematically, forces are therefore vectors. Simplified, a force can also be calculated as the product of the mass of the body to be moved and the acceleration achieved by the force (F = m × a).
Describe the difference between weight and weight force! Indicate how to calculate the latter!
- The quantity commonly called "weight" in everyday language corresponds more to the so-called mass m in physics. This is a constant quantity that is a property of a body. The weight force G is the force that pulls a body toward the Earth and is thus what you can, for example, measure on a scale. Because the Earth's gravity slightly varies in the Earth's force field, the weight force is not the same everywhere. It can be calculated as the product of the body's mass and the Earth's gravity g = 9.81 m/s².
What is an impulse and how is it calculated?
- An impulse p describes the "amount of motion" of a body with a mass m. It can be calculated as the product of this mass and the velocity of the body.
### - Translation

How can the speed of a moving object be determined mathematically or graphically?
- The velocity v of an object is the quotient of the distance traveled and the time required. Graphically, the velocity can be determined as the slope of the line in a distance/time diagram.
What is meant by acceleration, how is it calculated or graphically determined?
- The acceleration a of an object is the quotient of the change in velocity over time. It must be distinguished whether the object was initially at rest, then the formula is a = v/t, or if the object was already in motion, then the formula is a = (v2 - v1) / t = (v2² - v1²) / (2 × s). Graphically, the acceleration corresponds to the vector of the total force acting on the object.
### - Rotational Movement

What are the quantities of a rotational motion that are analogous to force and momentum of a translational motion? How are the two quantities calculated?
- Translation and rotation differ only by the direction of the force that initiates the movement. The strength of the translation movement is the force (F), which is calculated as the product of mass and acceleration of the body. Analogous to force, in rotational motion there is the so-called torque (M), which can be calculated as the product of the applied force and the radius (r) of the rotation. The impulse of translational motion is calculated as the product of mass and velocity of the body. Analogously, for rotational motion, there is an angular momentum, calculated as the product of the moment of inertia (analogous to mass) and angular velocity (speed of rotation).
### - Periodic Movements: Oscillations

What important value should be considered when a movement repeats periodically?
- When a movement repeats evenly, that is periodically, this can be described by the so-called frequency. The frequency, often abbreviated as f or ν, is the reciprocal of the time it takes for the movement to repeat. The unit of frequency is therefore 1/s or Hertz = "Hz".
### - Energy, Work, Power

Explain the difference between kinetic and potential energy using the example of a swinging pendulum!
- Kinetic energy, also called motion energy, is the energy contained in the movement of a body. It is calculated with the formula E = ½ mV². Potential energy is the positional energy, that is, the energy stored in an exposed position of a body; it is calculated with the formula E = m × g × h. In a swinging pendulum, the potential energy is greatest when the pendulum swings out to its maximum. At the same time, the velocity is then at its lowest, since this is the turning point of the movement. Conversely, the kinetic energy is at its greatest and the potential energy at its lowest when the velocity of the movement is maximum, i.e., when the pendulum hangs straight down. The sum of potential and kinetic energy remains constant during the entire oscillation process.
What is the relationship between a force and the work it performs?
- Work is the amount of energy that must be expended in a process. When you lift an object, lifting work is done, which can be calculated as the product of weight force and height. When you accelerate an object, acceleration work is done, which is calculated as the product of force and distance.
What is meant by performance?
- Power (P) is the energy expended or work done per unit of time and is therefore calculated as the quotient of work (W) and time interval (Δt). The unit Watt (W) can also be given as J/s.
### Deformation of Bodies

Describe the deformation of a body using Hooke's Law!
- Hooke's law describes the force that leads to an elastic deformation of a body and is therefore called tensile force. It can be calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of the body, the resulting strain, and the so-called modulus of elasticity, which is a material-dependent constant.
Depending on the material a body is made of, it can be deformed with varying degrees of ease. Explain and name the resistance that acts against deformation!
- Depending on the material a body consists of, its resistance against deformation varies. This material property can be described by the so-called modulus of elasticity. It is the quotient of stress and strain of the body. The smaller the numerical value of the modulus of elasticity, the easier the material can be deformed, i.e., the lower the resistance to deformation.
Describe the energy that can be stored in a stretched spring and compare it with another form of energy that you know!
- The so-called strain energy can be calculated analogously to kinetic energy (motion energy) with the formula energy = ½ × spring constant × displacement².
### Hydrostatics

What is meant by the density of a material?
- Density describes the ratio of the mass of a body to its volume. It can be calculated with the formula ρ = m/V and is given in the unit g/L.
What is pressure and what units do you know to describe it?
- Pressure is the force (F) acting on an area (A). In physics, pressure is given in Pascal, which corresponds to Newton per square meter (N/m²). In medicine, for example, the outdated unit millimeter of mercury (mmHg) is often used for blood pressure, which can be converted into Pascal: 1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa. Less commonly, the unit centimeter of water column (cmH2O) is used, e.g., for ventilators. The conversion of this unit into Pascal is somewhat simpler: 1 cmH2O = 100 Pa.
### Application Examples

What does the law of the lever state?
- The law of the lever states that a lever is in equilibrium when the sum of all torques in one direction equals the sum of all torques in the opposite direction. Torques are calculated by multiplying force by the length of the lever arm. Therefore, the formula is force × lever arm = load × load arm.
What is the difference between centrifugal force and centripetal force?
- Centrifugal force and centripetal force are opposing forces of a rotational movement. Centrifugal force, also called "inertial force," is the force that pushes a rotating object outward. The centripetal force pulls the object toward the center of rotation and thus keeps it on a circular path.
How do you calculate centripetal acceleration?
- Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration of the centripetal force. It is calculated as the quotient of the square of the orbital (tangential) velocity and the radius of the circular path. Alternatively, it can be calculated as the product of the square of the angular velocity and the radius.
