# Unspecific Immune System
## Summary

The nonspecific (= innate, natural) immune system is already present at birth and employs initial defense mechanisms as soon as the body encounters pathogens. On one hand, these include physical and chemical barriers that are meant to prevent pathogens from entering the body at all, and on the other hand, soluble substances and cells of the nonspecific immune system that attempt to kill the pathogens that have entered the body.

The cells of the innate immune system have specialized pattern recognition receptors (so-called "Pattern Recognition Receptors"; PRRs) that enable them to respond quickly and in an antigen-independent manner to invading pathogens. However, this is not sufficient for a variety of pathogens. To eliminate these as well, a specific immune response is required, which takes hours and days to reach its full effectiveness. Therefore, the cells of the nonspecific immune system not only destroy pathogens but also directly initiate a specific immune response.
## Physical, Chemical, and Biological Mechanisms

To prevent pathogens from entering the body, the organism primarily relies on physical, chemical, and biological measures. In particular, the skin and mucous membranes are effectively protected from damage by potential pathogens. However, some reflexes, such as the cough reflex, also contribute to infection defense.

### Intact external skin and mucous membranes (digestive and urogenital tract, respiratory pathways)

- Keratinized epithelium (e.g., epidermis of the skin): protection against pathogen entry
- Ciliary function of the airways (ciliated epithelium of the trachea and bronchi): Transport of infiltrated pathogens back into the environment.
- Symbiosis with other microorganisms (natural flora): Displacement or inhibited reproduction of pathogenic agents
    - Skin, intestine, vagina (Döderlein bacteria)
    - Disturbances of this balance can lead to diseases: thrush, pseudomembranous colitis, vaginitis.

### Production of mucus and secretions

Mucus and body secretions contain nonspecific and specific infection-fighting substances.

- Enzyme
    - Lysozyme: An enzyme produced by neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages that can lyse bonds in peptidoglycans (e.g., the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria)
        - Occurrences: Tear fluid, saliva, sweat
    - Lactoferrin: Has enzymatic activity and binds iron
    - Pepsin: As a protease of the stomach, it is also capable of breaking down bacterial proteins.
- Peptide: Antimicrobial peptides that destroy the cell membrane of bacteria (e.g., defensins)
- Acids: Stomach acid, vaginal secret with acidic pH
- Immunoglobulins (especially IgA): Formed by mucosa-associated B-lymphocytes

### Surfactant-Protein

Surfactant proteins are contained in the lung surfactant and consist of several subgroups. The two subtypes SP-A and SP-D primarily have immunological functions:

- Marking of pathogens to facilitate phagocytosis (so-called opsonization)
- Antifungal Effects

### Cough/Cough Reflex

- Defense mechanism: Irritations from cough receptors in the nose, the sinuses, the upper and/or lower airways trigger the cough reflex.
    - Function: Protection against respiratory infections and damage to the airways

## Cellular Mechanisms

The cells of the nonspecific immune system can attack pathogens upon first contact. They recognize the typical structures of pathogens (so-called Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns; PAMPs) through specialized pattern recognition receptors (so-called Pattern Recognition Receptors; PRRs) and are therefore not dependent on the recognition of specific antigens. In addition to the direct killing of pathogens or degenerated cells, the cells of the innate immune system also initiate the adaptive immune response. The so-called antigen-presenting cells prime and activate lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system. This leads to the formation of a whole "army" of specific immune effector cells directed against the same antigen and can also develop memory cells alongside combating pathogens.

### Cells of the nonspecific immune system

- Granulocytes
    - Neutrophil Granulocytes
    - Eosinophilic Granulocytes
    - Basophilic Granulocytes
- Professional antigen-presenting cells
    - Dendritic cells
    - Mononuclear phagocyte system (= MPS): Monocytes/Macrophages
    - B cells are also antigen-presenting cells, but they are assigned to the specific immune system.
- Natural killer cells (= NK cells)
- Mast cells

### Receptors

- Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can recognize pathogens based on their pathogen-associated but nonspecific patterns (PAMPs).
- MHC receptors: Cellular surface proteins for antigen presentation
## Granulocytes

Granulocytes make up about 40–60% of the leukocytes. Through chemokines, they can be recruited from the blood to the site of inflammation, which is why they are particularly crucial in acute defense.

### Neutrophil Granulocytes

- Profile
    - Frequency: 40–60% of the leukocytes
    - Size: 12–15 μm
    - Nucleus: Segmented (3–4 segments)
- Granule
    - Coloring (naming): Light pink (rather neutral)
    - Content: Various peptides and enzymes that have bactericidal properties, among others
- Function
    - Nonspecific detection and binding of extracellular pathogens (e.g., bacteria)
    - Phagocytosis
        1. Fusion of phagosome and granules
        2. Destruction of the ingested microorganism by the substances of the granules
        3. Destruction of the granulocyte
        4. Formation of Pus
    - NETosis: A special form of programmed cell death involving the formation of "Neutrophil Extracellular Traps" (=NET) by activated polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes.
        1. Ejection of strands coated with proteins (=NET) from granular proteins and nuclear components
        2. Sticking and neutralizing pathogens in these "traps"
        3. Recruitment of additional immune cells
        4. Cytokine release
    - Production of bactericidal substances: Formation and release of cytotoxic oxygen radicals (peroxides) catalyzed by NADPH oxidase leads to the "respiratory burst"
        - The oxygen radicals are further converted to hydrogen peroxide.
        - Myeloperoxidase catalyzes the oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite with the help of hydrogen peroxide, which is strongly antimicrobial and is involved in the destruction of pathogen cell membranes.
- Life cycle
    - Development: Myeloid stem cell → common precursor cell for neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes → banded granulocyte → segmented granulocyte (see also: granulopoiesis)
    - Circulation: <1 day in the blood, then migration to the inflamed tissue (attraction to the site of infection by chemokines)
    - Reserve
        - "Marginal Pool": At the endothelium of the large veins
        - Bone marrow reserve: Mature and nearly mature (band-shaped) granulocytes

### Eosinophilic Granulocytes

- Profile
    - Frequency: 1–3% of leukocytes
    - Size: 12–17 μm
    - Nucleus: Bilobed (lens-shaped)
- Granule
    - Staining (naming): Eosinophil (red)
    - Content: Cytotoxic substances (e.g., Major Basic Protein, Eosinophilic Peroxidase, Eosinophil Derived Neurotoxin, or Eosinophilic Cationic Peptide) and pro-inflammatory substances
- Function
    - Destruction of parasites (especially combating worm diseases) and viruses (especially through Eosinophilic Peroxidase and Eosinophil Derived Neurotoxin)
    - Involved in allergic reactions
- Life cycle
    - Development: Myeloid stem cell → Common precursor cell for eosinophils and basophils (see also: Granulopoiesis)
    - Localization: The majority reside in the entire GI tract (except for the esophagus), a smaller portion circulates in the blood.

### Basophil Granulocytes

- Profile
    - Frequency: 0–1% of leukocytes
    - Size: 14–16 μm
    - Nucleus: Segmented (dumbbell-shaped)
- Granule
    - Staining (naming): Basophilic (dark blue/purple)
    - Content
        - Histamine
        - Heparin
        - Other mediators (e.g. arachidonic acid and its derivatives)
- Function
    - Combating pathogens (presumably mainly parasites)
    - Involved in allergic reactions: Binding of the Fc portion of antigen-loaded IgE leads to the release of inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine) from their granules upon cross-linking of the bound antigens.
- Life cycle
    - Development: Myeloid stem cell → Common precursor cell for eosinophils and basophils (see also: Granulopoiesis)
    - Localization: Circulation in the blood (Attraction to the site of infection by chemokines)

> [!NOTE] Reactive link shift
> In the case of an acute bacterial infection, the body must quickly provide a large number of granulocytes. This is ensured by a reserve in the large veins and in the bone marrow. Under the microscope, one can observe an increased number of banded granulocytes as a manifestation of the acute infection due to the accelerated release of partly unfinished cells. This change in blood picture is referred to as reactive left shift.

> [!NOTE] Parasitic Diseases
> In the context of parasitic diseases (e.g. worm diseases), there is usually an increase in eosinophilic granulocytes in the peripheral blood (eosinophilia). How eosinophilic granulocytes interact with the parasites is still a subject of research. However, there is evidence that they are involved in the defense against parasitic pathogens.

## Mononuclear Phagocyte System (MPS)

Monocytes circulate in the blood after their formation in the bone marrow. Some phagocytose pathogens and transport them to a regional lymph node for antigen presentation. All others migrate into peripheral tissues after a short circulation in the blood. There, they mature into macrophages, which are referred to differently depending on their location.

### Profile

- Definition: The totality of phagocytes derived from monocytes
- Cell types: Monocytes and macrophages
- Frequency: 4–8% of leukocytes
- Construction
    - Size: 10–20 μm
    - Nucleus: Large, kidney-shaped, partly lobed
    - Granules: Lytic or cytotoxic enzymes (e.g. lysozyme, acid phosphatase)
- Life cycle
    - Development: Myeloid stem cell → Common precursor cell for neutrophilic granulocytes and monocytes (see also: monopoiesis)
    - Localization: Initially circulation in the blood; then there are two possibilities
        1. Remain as a monocyte in circulation: Direct phagocytosis of pathogens followed by transport to the regional lymph nodes for antigen presentation.
        2. Differentiation into macrophages: Emigration into peripheral tissue and maturation into macrophages, which then also phagocytize pathogens and take on other regulatory functions.
- Locomotion: Amoeboid
- Designation: The macrophages are referred to differently depending on their location.
    - Brain: Microglia
    - Liver: Kupffer cell
    - Lung: Alveolar macrophage
    - Cartilage/Bone: Chondro-/Osteoclast
    - Kidney: Mesangial cell
    - Milz: Shore cell
    - Placental villi: Hofbauer cell

### Function

Monocytes and macrophages bind pathogens through their receptors (Pattern Recognition Receptors). These can be directly eliminated through phagocytosis, and the antigen fragments are subsequently presented to lymphocytes.

- Detection of pathogens via PRRs and phagocytosis: Pathogen is enclosed by the cell membrane and taken up into a so-called phagosome → fusion with the cytoplasmic lysosomes to form a phagolysosome
- Intracellular hydrolysis of pathogens: At the phagolysosome, nitrogen radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2- (superoxide anion) are generated through the so-called respiratory burst, which act on pathogens captured there in the phagolysosome and can also be released extracellularly.
    - The key enzyme for the formation of superoxide anions is NADPH oxidase.
- Antigen presentation via MHC-II: Particularly interaction with TH1 cells → The ability of macrophages for intracellular hydrolysis is significantly enhanced.
- Secretarial function
    - Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines: Initiation, maintenance, and regulation of the inflammatory response (e.g., increase of vascular permeability with edema formation)
    - Chemokine: Attracting additional defense cells (e.g., neutrophil granulocytes or dendritic cells)
    - Growth factors
    - Complement factors
- Additional functions: A variety of other functions such as, for example, the fusion into multinucleated giant cells in the context of granulomatous diseases, the interaction with tumor cells (so-called tumor-associated macrophages), and various regulatory functions, for instance, in the context of wound healing, are the subject of current research.
## Natural Killer Cells (NK Cells)

Due to their immediate readiness to respond against virus-infected cells and tumor cells, and the lack of a receptor for specific antigen recognition, natural killer cells (NK cells) are classified as part of the nonspecific immune system.

### Profile

- Cell type: Subform of lymphocytes
- Frequency: 5–15% of lymphocytes
- Construction
    - Size: 11–15 μm
    - Nucleus: Round and darkly colored
    - Granules: Cytotoxic enzymes (e.g., Perforin, Granzyme)
- Life cycle
    - Development: In the bone marrow from lymphatic stem cells
    - Localization: Circulation in the blood

### Function

- Antigen-independent recognition and elimination of virus-infected and degenerated cells: Faster response than other lymphoid cells (since antigen-independent – activity peak already 3 days after the onset of infection)
    - MHC-I-dependent cytotoxicity: Control of MHC-I molecules on the body's own cells → When MHC-I molecules are present in insufficient amounts or altered on the cell surface, the NK cell is activated → Degranulation with the release of cytotoxic substances → Infected/degenerated body cell is killed (by apoptosis)
    - Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity: Binding of the Fc receptor of the NK cell to (antibody-opsonized) cells → Degranulation → Cell is killed (by apoptosis)
- Cytokine secretion (e.g. IFN-γ)
## Mast Cells

Mast cells are clinically extremely relevant because they play a central role in allergic reactions.

### Profile

- Size: 8–20 μm
- Granule
    - Staining: Basophilic (dark blue/purple)
    - Content: Including histamine, heparin, hydrolases, proteases
- Life cycle
    - Development: In the bone marrow from myeloid stem cells
    - Localization: In the interstitial connective tissue, especially at the transition from the interior of the body to the external environment

### Function

Mast cells can directly recognize antigens through membrane-bound IgE antibodies that are attached to their Fc receptors. Activation and degranulation of mast cells by allergens only occurs when there is cross-linking of the membrane-bound IgE antibodies, but this happens within a few seconds. However, mast cells can also be activated by the complement system or physical trauma (heat, cold).

- Initiation and regulation of inflammatory reactions
    - Physiological function: Parasite defense
    - Pathophysiological function: Allergic reactions
- Support in the elimination of pathogens
    - Gastrointestinal tract: Increased fluid secretion and peristalsis (→ Diarrhea and vomiting)
    - Airways: Increased mucus production and bronchoconstriction (→ Blockage of the airways resulting in coughing and sneezing)
    - Vessels: Increased blood flow and permeability (→ Increased extravasation and thus increased lymph flow)

> [!NOTE] Allergic immediate reaction and anaphylactic shock
> An immediate-type allergic reaction is characterized by several steps. First, an allergen triggers excessive production of IgE antibodies upon initial contact, which can bind to the Fc receptor on the surface of mast cells. These cells are now sensitized to the allergen. Upon a second antigen contact, this binds to the IgE receptors on the mast cell surface, leading to the cross-linking of IgE molecules. This serves as the stimulus for degranulation. The released histamine and other inflammatory mediators cause peripheral vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and airway obstruction. Clinically, this presents depending on the severity of the allergic reaction as erythema, edema, itching, hypotension, and difficulty breathing. In its maximum expression, this can lead to circulatory failure. This is referred to as anaphylactic shock, which represents a life-threatening situation. Depending on the severity of the allergic reaction, a hierarchical scheme is employed that includes both H1 and H2 receptor blockers.

## Professional Antigen-Presenting Cells (APC)

Professional antigen-presenting cells include macrophages, B lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. Dendritic cells are part of the innate immune system and are primarily responsible for capturing and processing peripheral antigens. They then migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, where they present the antigens to naive lymphocytes, effectively "priming" them. Only through this immunological priming can naive lymphocytes develop into mature effector cells (e.g., CD8+ cytotoxic T cells) and trigger an adaptive immune response.

### Dendritic Cells (= DC)

#### Overview

- Development: In the bone marrow from myeloid and lymphoid stem cells
- Morphology and occurrence: Depending on the ripeness stage
- Classification by maturity stages: Dendritic cells have different functions depending on their maturity stage, as well as different morphology and names.
    - Immature: Primarily found in peripheral tissues, they take up large amounts of antigens there with their highly branched cell processes and process them.
        - Langerhans cells: Immature dendritic cells of the skin and mucous membranes
        - Interstitial dendritic cells: Dendritic cells of the interstitium in the rest of the body
    - Migrating: Moving to antigen processing with lymph flow into secondary lymphatic organs.
        - Veiled cells: Due to their morphology with many membrane invaginations, migrating dendritic cells are also referred to as veiled cells.
    - Reif: Present the antigens in secondary lymphatic organs primarily to lymphocytes in order to prime and activate them.
        - Interdigitating dendritic cell (= IDC): They are located in the T-cell zones of secondary lymphatic organs and interact there with CD8+ T cells via MHC-I and with CD4+ T cells via MHC-II.
        - Follicular dendritic cell (= FDC): Located in the B-cell zones of secondary lymphatic organs to interact with B lymphocytes there.

#### Functions

For the exact procedures regarding the interaction of dendritic cells with other immune cells, see also: Introduction to the nonspecific immune response (innate immune system).

- Uptake, processing, and presentation of antigens to T lymphocytes: Naive T lymphocytes in secondary lymphatic organs are presented with their corresponding antigen, which primes and activates them, leading to their development into mature T effector cells.
- Support B-lymphocytes in affinity maturation: Follicular dendritic cells capture immune complexes and present them to B-lymphocytes in secondary lymphatic organs, thereby assisting B-lymphocytes in affinity maturation.
- Strong interferon production in the context of viral infections

### Macrophages and B-Lymphocytes

See also: Mononuclear phagocyte system and B-lymphocytes
## Receptors of the nonspecific immune system

The immune system must act quickly on one hand, but also as specifically as possible against invading pathogens on the other hand. These two functions are ensured by different parts of the immune system and the corresponding receptors.

### Pattern Recognition Receptors

The cells of the innate immune system have specialized pattern recognition receptors (so-called Pattern Recognition Receptors; PRRs) that enable them to respond quickly and in an antigen-independent manner to invading pathogens while also paving the way for a response from the adaptive immune system. These include, for example, Toll-like, Scavenger, and NOD-like receptors. These receptors roughly differentiate between "foreign" and "self" by binding to evolutionarily conserved molecular structures that are very similar among many pathogens (so-called Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns; PAMPs), but are not as highly specific as antigens. Although this process is not as effective as the antigen-dependent specific immune response and also lacks a memory effect, it is significantly faster. This is partly because no processing and presentation of an antigen, nor priming and clonal expansion of the appropriate lymphocytes, is necessary.

#### Toll-like receptor (= TLR)

- Ligand: Depending on the Toll-like receptor, different microbial components (e.g., lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipomannan, dsRNA)
    - Lipopolysaccharides are primarily recognized by TLR-4 together with its coreceptor CD14.
- Occurrence: Among others, on monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, B lymphocytes, mast cells, intestinal epithelial cells
- Function: Overall, there is primarily an amplification of the inflammatory reaction as well as an increased production of antimicrobial and antiviral substances (specific response depending on the TLR-bearing cell)

#### C-type lectin receptor

- Ligand: Insb. Binding of microbial carbohydrates (e.g. Mannose)
- Occurrence: Particularly on macrophages and dendritic cells
- Function: Targeted, antigen-independent phagocytosis (followed by antigen presentation and modulation of the nonspecific and specific immune response)

#### NOD-like receptor (= NLR)

- Ligand: Bacterial components that entered the cytosol
- Occurrence: Especially in macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells at the boundaries to the "outside world"
- Function: Amplification of the inflammatory response and increased cell death

#### Scavenger Receptor

- Ligand: Insb. Components of bacterial cell walls
- Occurrence: On macrophages
- Function
    - Facilitation of phagocytosis
    - Increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines

### Other antigen-independent receptors

#### Complement receptor (= CR)

- Ligand: Pathogens opsonized with complement factors
- Occurrence: Among others on macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, B-lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and erythrocytes.
- Function: Dependent on activated cell
    1. In phagocytes: Increase in phagocytic activity (particularly through the binding of the opsonin C3b)
    2. In almost all other cells: Enhanced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines

### Antigen-dependent receptors

#### Fc receptor (= Fc-R)

- Ligand: Fc part of immunoglobulins with which pathogens have been opsonized.
- Occurrence: In particular on macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, mast cells, NK cells
- Function: Dependent on the active cell
    1. Especially in phagocytes: Enhanced phagocytosis and elimination of antibody-opsonized antigens
    2. Especially with basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells: Increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
## The MHC System

### MHC Receptors

The MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) receptors are two groups of glycoproteins that the immune system uses, among other things, to distinguish "foreign" from "self" and to regulate the immune response.

#### MHC-I Receptors

The so-called MHC-I receptors are expressed by almost every nucleated body cell as well as by platelets and present fragments of proteins produced within the cell. In this way, the MHC-I receptors provide immune cells with clues that this is a body cell, as well as what this cell is currently producing. When a cell becomes malignant or is infected with a virus, it produces different proteins and thus also presents different antigen fragments via the MHC-I receptor. An exception here is the so-called cross-presentation by dendritic cells, which can not only present their own protein fragments via the MHC-I receptor but also foreign antigens to prime naive CD8+ T cells.

- Occurrence: In almost all nucleated body cells as well as on platelets
- Construction
    - Heavy α-chain: Forms the antigen-binding cleft
    - Stabilizing, non-covalently bound β2-microglobulin
- Functions
    - Presentation of intracellular antigens
        - Healthy Cell
            - Parts of the intracellularly produced proteins are loaded onto MHC-I receptors in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum after their processing in the proteasome (so-called antigen processing).
            - MHC-I receptors continuously present these self-antigens on the cell surface (MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation) to be recognized as self and ignored by NK cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.
        - Degenerate/virus-infected cells
            - MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation of parts of the intracellularly produced tumor-specific/viral proteins after their antigen processing in the proteasome.
            - CD8+-cytotoxic T cells and NK cells recognize the cells
            - Release of cytotoxic substances and induction of apoptosis
    - Presentation of extracellular (foreign) antigens (so-called cross-presentation)
        - Antigen uptake and presentation: Dendritic cells take up extracellular pathogens and antigens and present them exceptionally via MHC-I receptor.
        - Priming: Naive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, whose T cell receptor matches the presented antigen, recognize it; they are primed and activated.
        - T cell reaction upon antigen contact: The now mature CD8+ cytotoxic T cells monitor the MHC-I receptors of all cells they encounter on their "patrols" through the blood and tissues for the matching antigen → Upon recognition, they secrete cytotoxic substances and induce apoptosis

> [!NOTE]
> The antigen presentation via MHC-I serves to activate CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as to initiate an immune response by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells!

#### MHC-II Receptors

The MHC-II receptors are primarily found on professional antigen-presenting cells, which present extracellularly taken antigens to CD4+ T cells. Only the few T cells that have the T cell receptor specific to the presented antigen can be primed and activated. The presented antigen and the T cell receptor behave like a key and a lock in relation to each other.

- Occurrence: On professional antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes)
- Structure: Two chains (α- and β-chain) together form an antigen-binding cleft.
- Function: Presentation of extracellular (foreign) antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes in order to either prime them (especially dendritic cells) or regulate their activity (B lymphocytes and macrophages)

### MHC-Gene

The genes for the MHC receptors (also known as HLA genes in humans) are located in the MHC region on the short arm of chromosome 6. This region is divided into three different sections that code for different MHC receptors. The HLA genes (from the English "human leukocyte antigen") exhibit various alleles ("polymorphism"), so each individual (except for identical (!) twins) has their own MHC protein profile. This becomes particularly relevant in organ or stem cell transplants.

- Major genes MHC-I: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C
- Major genes MHC-II: HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR

HLA System Compatibility in Stem Cell/Organ Transplantation
In stem cell or organ transplantation, foreign material is transferred to the patient. To prevent an immune rejection reaction, a series of conditions must be met, which vary depending on the transplanted tissue. While liver and kidney transplants can nowadays be performed even with HLA incompatibility, the HLA characteristics for the transplantation of foreign stem cells must be as identical as possible. The transplantation-relevant HLAs are HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ. Since one maternal and one paternal allele is inherited, 10 different HLA characteristics must be considered for donor selection. Due to nearly 10,000 possible combinations of these molecules, the search for a donor is often very challenging despite good databases. The success rate of the search is highest when examining siblings.
## Humoral Mechanisms

The humoral (from Latin humoris = fluid, moisture) mechanisms of the nonspecific immune system are based on proteins circulating in the blood. They are primarily produced by the cells of the nonspecific immune system. Their function consists, on one hand, of directly defending against invading pathogens (e.g., through the complement system) and, on the other hand, initiating a more extensive immune response.

### Involved Plasma Proteins

- Acute-phase proteins: Are synthesized in the liver in increased amounts during an inflammatory response and support the nonspecific immune response.
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukins, interferons, TNF-α, eicosanoids): Are synthesized by immune cells
- Complement system: About 30 plasma proteins produced by the liver that can attract immune cells and also kill pathogens themselves.

### Functions

- Introduction and reinforcement of the immune response
    - Activation, proliferation, and attraction (chemotaxis) of immune cells
    - Vasodilation → Increased blood flow and increased lymphatic drainage
    - Increase in vascular permeability → Increased extravasation of immune cells present in the blood
    - Increased phagocytosis of pathogens through opsonization using complement factors
- Direct defense against pathogens: For example, through the complement system (membrane attack complex)
## Complement System

The complement system consists of around 30 different plasma proteins, the so-called complement factors, which are predominantly synthesized and released by the hepatocytes of the liver. These are proteins that circulate in the blood as inactive precursors and fulfill three important functions: First, they can directly fend off pathogens (membrane attack complex), second, they can mark them for facilitated phagocytosis (opsonization), and third, they can enhance the inflammatory response (chemotaxis and increased vascular permeability). On one hand, they have independent functions, but on the other hand, they also provide a connection between the nonspecific and specific immune systems.

### Complement Factors

In inflammatory reactions, complement factors act like pattern recognition receptors and recognize pathogens in an antigen-independent manner. They then activate each other in a cascading manner and lead to the elimination of the pathogen as well as the amplification of the inflammatory response through various mechanisms. They can be activated via three different pathways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway.

While the complement factors of the classical pathway are always named with "C" and a number (e.g., C3), those of the alternative pathway are referred to as "factors" and a letter (e.g., factor B). The complement factors are proteases that cleave each other. The cleavage products are categorized by size into a small fragment "a" and a large fragment "b". An exception is made for the individual components of the C1 protein: they are referred to as C1q, C1r, and C1s.

#### Functions

1. Direct pathogen defense: Bacterial lysis through the membrane attack complex (MAC), which consists of factors C5b and C6–C9.
2. Enhanced phagocytosis through opsonization: Marking of the pathogen by attaching a complement factor (C3b and C4b), making it faster and easier to be phagocytosed.
3. Amplification of the local inflammatory response: For example, by attracting additional immune cells (chemotaxis), such as through factor C5a, or by increasing vascular permeability.

### Activation of the Complement System

The activation of the complement system can occur in three ways: the classical pathway, the alternative pathway, and the lectin pathway. Despite the different activation pathways, they ultimately lead to the formation of a C3 convertase through all routes. The various pathways converge at a common endpoint.

#### Classical Activation Path

In the classical pathway, C1 primarily binds to antibody/antigen complexes and is thus activated.

1. Binding: C1 usually binds to the Fc part of an antibody bound to an antigen (e.g. IgG)
2. Splitting: C1 splits C4 and C2
    1. C4 → C4a + C4b
    2. C2 → C2a + C2b
3. Formation of the C3 convertase: The complex of C4b + C2b forms the C3 convertase (C4bC2b)

#### Lectin Pathway

In the lectin pathway, the activation of the complement cascade occurs via soluble factors (mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins), which are primarily produced in the liver during the acute phase response. These factors recognize repetitive patterns on pathogen surfaces (PAMPs), for example, carbohydrate residues such as the namesake mannose, and are thus initially activated.

1. Starting form: MBL binds in plasma to proteases (MASP-1+2) with a similar function as C1 → the complex is inactive until it binds to pathogens.
2. Binding: Complexed MBL binds to the pathogen surface, resulting in a conformational change and activation of MASP-2.
3. Cleavage: MASP-2 cleaves C2 and C4 (analogous to the classical pathway)
4. Formation of the C3 convertase: The complex of C4b + C2b forms the C3 convertase (C4bC2b)

#### Alternative Activation Path

In the so-called alternative activation pathway, the initiation of the complement cascade occurs through the spontaneous formation of C3b or through the first step of the common terminal pathway of the classical or lectin pathway. The C3 convertase (C4bC2b) of the classical or lectin pathway generates C3b in the first step of the common terminal pathway and thus initiates the alternative pathway, which leads to the formation of another form of C3 convertase (C3bBb). A peculiarity of the alternative pathway is that, on the one hand, it is initiated by the formation of C3b and, on the other hand, it itself generates C3b through the formation of the C3 convertase in the first step of the common terminal pathway - thus continuously amplifying itself.

1. Formation of C3b
    - Spontaneous: C3b is generated through spontaneous hydrolysis (from C3)
    - Through the classical or lectin pathway: C3b is generated previously by the first step of the common end pathway of the classical or lectin pathways.
2. Binding: C3b binds to pathogen surface
3. Splitting
    - Factor B (a circulating plasma protein) binds to C3b
    - Factor D splits bound factor B into factor Ba and factor Bb
4. Formation of the C3 convertase: The complex of C3b and Bb forms the C3 convertase (C3bBb)

#### Shared Finish Line

All three activation pathways form a C3 convertase and thereby initiate a common terminal pathway.

1. Cleavage of C3: C3 convertase cleaves C3 → C3a + C3b
2. Formation of the C5 convertase: By binding of C3b to the C3 convertase of the various pathways, a so-called C5 convertase is formed.
    1. Classical and lectin pathway: C4bC2bC3b
    2. Alternative Path: C3b2Bb
3. Splitting: From C5 by C5 convertase (C5 → C5a + C5b)
4. Formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC): Factors C6–9 combine with C5b to form the MAC.
5. Cell lysis: The cell wall of the pathogen, to which the initial substances (C1, C3b, or MBL) have bound, is perforated by the MAC, leading to cell lysis.
## Acute Phase Proteins and Negative Acute Phase Proteins

The so-called acute phase reaction is primarily triggered by macrophages and dendritic cells. After contact with pathogens, they secrete various cytokines (especially TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), which among other things influence the protein synthesis of liver cells, leading to an increased production of a group of proteins (so-called acute phase proteins) and a compensatory decrease in the production of another group (so-called negative acute phase proteins).

### Acute-Phase-Proteins

Some of the acute-phase proteins mimic the function of antibodies by opsonizing pathogens and activating the complement system. However, acute-phase proteins do not recognize antigens, but rather "only" nonspecific, typical pathogen patterns (PAMPs).

- Definition: >30 different plasma proteins that increase by at least 25% during inflammation
- Synthesist: Liver
- Important representatives and their function
    - C-reactive Protein (CRP): Opsonization of pathogens and activation of the classical pathway of the complement system
    - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL): Opsonization of pathogens and activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system
    - Ferritin: Pathogens receive less of the essential iron for them.
    - Haptoglobin: Pathogens receive less of the essential iron they need.
    - Fibrinogen: Coagulation promotion, to locally "trap" pathogens by forming small thrombi and to hinder their hematogenous dissemination.
    - Alpha-1 Antitrypsin: Protection against protease overactivity
    - Procalcitonin: Is determined as a sensitive progression parameter, especially in SIRS and sepsis.

### Negative Acute-Phase Proteins

The production of so-called negative acute phase proteins decreases in the context of an acute inflammatory reaction.

- Important representatives
    - Albumin
    - Transferrin
    - Antithrombin

> [!NOTE] Acute-phase reaction
> The acute phase reaction is a complex humoral and cellular general reaction of the body to tissue damage. Typically, it is found as an immune reaction in the context of infections, but also in cases of trauma or malignancies. It includes the typical triad of an increase in leukocytes (leukocytosis), acute phase proteins such as CRP and procalcitonin, and the accompanying increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In addition, there may be a decrease in so-called negative acute phase proteins. The change in acute phase and negative acute phase proteins is reflected in the laboratory not only through direct measurement but also in serum electrophoresis. It is less a clinical presentation and more a laboratory medical change that can provide indications of infections, trauma, or malignancies (see: Pathological changes in protein fractions).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Unspecific Immune System
### Physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms

Which enzymes of the non-specific defense are found in body secretions or mucus, and what effects do they have?
- Enzymes found in mucus and secretions are part of the innate immune system. These include lysozyme (dissolution of peptidoglycans in the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria), lactoferrin (iron binding), and pepsin (intestinal protease, can also split bacteria).

### Cellular Mechanisms

Which cells of the innate immune system do you know?
- The cells of the non-specific immune system include granulocytes, professional antigen-presenting cells, and natural killer cells. Mast cells can trigger a non-specific immune response, but they are usually counted as part of the specific immune system.

Which cells of the innate immune system develop from myeloid progenitor cells? Which develop from lymphoid progenitor cells?
- Granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and mast cells develop from myeloid progenitor cells. Natural killer cells develop from lymphoid stem cells.

Name various granulocytes along with their frequency!
- The innate immune system includes neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic granulocytes. The most common leukocytes are neutrophilic granulocytes (40–60%). Eosinophils follow at a considerable distance with 1–3% and basophils with 0–1% of leukocytes.

Describe the appearance of neutrophilic granulocytes!
- The cytoplasm of neutrophilic granulocytes stains weakly pink (neutral) in Pappenheim staining and contains numerous dark granules in places. The nucleus is typically divided into 3–4 segments.

Describe the process of the immune response mediated by neutrophil granulocytes!
- Neutrophilic granulocytes are attracted by chemokines and emigrate from the bloodstream to the site of inflammation. There, they non-specifically recognize pathogens and bind them, which leads to phagocytosis of the pathogen. The phagocytosed material is killed by substances from the granules, including oxygen radicals and various enzymes such as lysozyme. The formation of cytotoxic oxygen radicals is catalyzed mainly by NADPH-dependent oxidase, and their release occurs in the so-called "respiratory burst." With the help of hydrogen peroxide, myeloperoxidase catalyzes the oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite, which has strong antimicrobial effects.

Name typical ingredients of eosinophilic granules!
- The granules of eosinophilic granulocytes contain various cytotoxic and proinflammatory substances. Particularly typical for the former is the cytotoxic major basic protein, as well as eosinophilic peroxidase and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin; the latter include, for example, interleukins.

What is found in the granules of basophilic granulocytes?
- The granules of basophilic granulocytes mainly contain heparin and histamine as well as other mediators such as leukotrienes and other arachidonic acid derivatives.

What functions of basophilic granulocytes do you know?
- Basophilic granulocytes are primarily involved in triggering allergic reactions by binding to the Fc part of antigen-loaded IgE, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, they participate in combating invading pathogens.

What cells make up the mononuclear phagocyte system? How are they related?
- In the mononuclear phagocyte system, monocytes and macrophages are distinguished. They arise from myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and initially circulate in the blood. Monocytes remain in circulation and phagocytize pathogens there, which they then transport to regional lymph nodes for antigen presentation. Macrophages are tissue-resident monocytes that have migrated into peripheral tissues.

What immunological function does the mononuclear phagocyte system have?
- The main task of the phagocyte system is the eponymous phagocytosis. Monocytes and macrophages bind pathogens via their receptors (pattern recognition receptors, e.g., Toll-like receptors), phagocytize them, and then present the fragmented antigens using MHC-II antigens; monocytes in the regional lymph nodes, macrophages directly in their surrounding tissue. Additionally, they trigger, maintain, or regulate an inflammatory reaction through pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

Why are natural killer cells faster in their response than other lymphoid cells?
- Natural killer cells (NK cells) operate antigen-independently, making them faster than other lymphoid cells in killing transformed or virus-infected cells.
- The MHC-I- or antibody-mediated degranulation of the NK cell releases cytotoxic substances, which lead to apoptosis of the pathogenic cell.

What distinguishes mast cells from all other cells of the innate immune system?
- Mast cells can directly recognize antigens via membrane-bound IgE antibodies, which is pathophysiologically relevant in allergic reactions. Additionally, they can be directly activated by the complement system and physical trauma (heat, cold).

Name the professional antigen-presenting cells!
- Dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes are considered professional antigen-presenting cells.

Which ligands does the Toll-like receptor bind? Can you provide a specific example?
- The Toll-like receptor (TLR) is a pattern recognition receptor, meaning it recognizes molecular pathogenic surface structures of bacteria (e.g., lipopolysaccharides, lipomannan), viruses, or nucleic acids. For example, TLR-4 along with its coreceptor CD14 mainly binds lipopolysaccharides as found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.

### The MHC System

What functions do MHC receptors perform? How do they differ?
- MHC (major histocompatibility complex) receptors serve to present antigen fragments on the cell surface. All nucleated cells as well as platelets possess MHC-I receptors on their surface, with which they present intracellular protein fragments. This allows recognition as self-cells, but also enables the detection and elimination of abnormal cytosolic proteins of transformed or virus-infected cells by NK and CD8+ T cells. MHC-II receptors, on the other hand, are found only on certain immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes), which present extracellularly taken up (= foreign) antigens to CD4+ T cells.

What intracellular processes lead to proteins being presented on the cell surface via MHC-I receptors?
- MHC-I receptors are loaded with peptides from intracellularly processed (= broken down) proteins in the proteasome. The "loading" of MHC-I receptors occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

How can a healthy cell be distinguished from a sick cell using MHC-I receptors?
- The MHC-I receptor presents currently intracellularly degraded protein fragments. If a cell is transformed or infected by a virus, the presented proteins as well as the number of MHC-I receptors change. This is recognized by NK and CD8+ T cells, which then induce apoptosis of the affected cell by releasing cytotoxic substances.

### Humoral Mechanisms

What is the complement system made of?
- The complement system consists of about 30 plasma proteins, most of which are synthesized in the liver by hepatocytes and circulate as inactive precursors in the blood.

What are the functions of the complement system? Also name the most important factors for each function!
- The complement system is activated during inflammatory processes. It can then directly defend against pathogens by inducing bacterial lysis via the membrane attack complex (MAC) (C5b and C6–9). Additionally, the complement factors C3b and C4b mark pathogens (opsonization), making them easier to recognize and therefore easier to phagocytize. Furthermore, complement factors C3a, C4a, and C5a enhance the local inflammatory reaction, for example through chemotaxis or increasing vascular permeability.

What pathways for the activation of the complement system do you know? What do they have in common?
- The complement system can be activated via three pathways: the classical, the alternative, and the lectin pathway. All pathways lead to the formation of a C3 convertase and share a common terminal pathway.

Explain the classical activation pathway of the complement system!
- For activation of the classical pathway of the complement system, C1 binds to antigen/antibody complexes. Here, C1 usually binds to the Fc part of an antigen-bound antibody. This causes C1 to cleave factor C4 into C4a and C4b and factor C2 into C2a and C2b. C4b and C2b combine to form the C3 convertase C4bC2b. This enzyme cleaves C3, producing C3b. From this point, all three pathways converge.

Explain the activation of the complement system via the lectin pathway!
- Certain soluble factors, produced primarily by the liver during an acute-phase reaction (including the eponymous mannose-binding lectin or MBL), can activate the lectin pathway of the complement system. Through various steps, the protease MASP-2 is activated, which cleaves C2 and C4. This leads to creation of the C3 convertase and initiates the common terminal pathway.

Explain the alternative activation pathway of the complement system! What is special about this activation pathway?
- The alternative complement activation pathway originates from C3b, which is formed either spontaneously or from the classical or lectin pathways. From C3b, factor B, and factor D, the complex C3bBb (a C3 convertase) is formed and initiates the common terminal pathway.
- Importantly, the alternative pathway sustains itself because it continuously produces its starting product C3b anew.

What end product is present at the common endpoint of the complement system, and what does this trigger?
- At the common terminal pathway, the membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed from factors C5b and C6-9. It perforates the cell wall of the pathogen and initiates its lysis.

Where are acute phase proteins/negative acute phase proteins produced? Name three important representatives for each.
- Acute phase proteins as well as negative acute phase proteins are produced in the liver. Important acute phase proteins are C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and mannose-binding lectin (MBL). Albumin, transferrin, and antithrombin are the primary representatives of negative acute phase proteins.

How do acute-phase proteins differ from negative acute-phase proteins?
- Upon triggering an acute phase reaction by dendritic cells and macrophages during an inflammatory response, acute phase proteins are increasingly produced in the liver. They mimic the function of antibodies by opsonizing pathogens and activating the complement system. However, they do not specifically recognize antigens but rather nonspecific typical pathogen patterns (PAMPs). In contrast, the serum concentration of negative acute phase proteins decreases as a result of an acute phase reaction.

How does a typical inflammatory reaction manifest in laboratory values? Is it specific?
- In an acute phase reaction, a typical triad of leukocytosis, increased acute phase proteins (CRP, procalcitonin, etc.), and accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be recognized in laboratory diagnostics. However, this pattern is also seen in malignant processes or trauma. It therefore serves as an indicator but cannot provide a definitive explanation.
