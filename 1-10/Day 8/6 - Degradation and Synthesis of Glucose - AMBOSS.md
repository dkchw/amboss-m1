# Degradation and Synthesis of Glucose
## Summary

Carbohydrates are the main energy suppliers for the human body. The energy-generating breakdown of the monosaccharide glucose occurs in the cytosol of every cell via glycolysis. Here, glucose is broken down into pyruvate in ten steps, producing two molecules of ATP and two reducing equivalents NADH+H+ through substrate-level phosphorylation. The further utilization of the reaction product pyruvate depends on the oxygen supply of the cell. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH), which is then oxidized to CO2 in the citric acid cycle. This process produces additional reducing equivalents that can be used for ATP generation through the electron transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation). In contrast, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted into lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In this case, no additional energy is generated; however, the NADH+H+ produced during glycolysis is regenerated to NAD+ and is available for a new round of glycolysis. Glycolysis is subject to strict allosteric and hormonal regulation. The hormonal regulation is mainly mediated by the antagonists insulin and glucagon.

Glucose can, however, also be broken down via an alternative pathway, the hexose monophosphate pathway (syn. pentose phosphate pathway). Here, pentoses (e.g., ribose) are produced, which are needed for the synthesis of DNA and RNA building blocks. Furthermore, the hexose monophosphate pathway serves to reduce NADP+ to NADPH+H+.

Liver and kidney are capable of synthesizing glucose from two molecules of pyruvate themselves. This so-called gluconeogenesis provides glucose for organs that primarily meet their energy needs through glucose during fasting periods. Gluconeogenesis is not a direct reversal of glycolysis: since the key reactions of glycolysis are irreversible, three additional enzymes are needed for gluconeogenesis to bypass these reactions. This costs the cell energy. Therefore, gluconeogenesis is not carried out in energy deficiency, but only in glucose deficiency.

## Glycolysis (Overview)

- Definition: Breakdown of glucose to pyruvate in ten steps, producing energy in the form of two molecules of ATP and two reduction equivalents of NADH+H+.
- Location: In the cytosol of all animal and plant cells
- Process: Glucose → Glucose-6-phosphate → Fructose-6-phosphate → Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate → Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + Dihydroxyacetone phosphate → 2× 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate → 2× 3-Phosphoglycerate → 2× 2-Phosphoglycerate → 2× Phosphoenolpyruvate → 2× Pyruvate
- Key enzymes
    - Hexokinase
    - Phosphofructokinase 1
    - Pyruvate kinase

## Reaction Steps of Glycolysis

The reaction process of glycolysis can be divided into three phases:

- Phase 1: Conversion of glucose to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
- Phase 2: Splitting of Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into 2 molecules of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
- Phase 3: Conversion of Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into Pyruvate

### Phase 1 (Conversion of Glucose to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate)

|Reaction|Substrate|Enzyme|Product|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Phosphorylation of Glucose|- Glucose|- Hexokinase (Key Enzyme)|- Glucose-6-phosphate|- Binding in the Cell<br>- ATP → ADP|
|2. Isomerization of Glucose-6-phosphate|- Glucose-6-phosphate|- Glucose-6-phosphate Isomerase|- Fructose-6-phosphate|- Conversion from the aldehyde to the keto form|

|5. Isomerization of DHAP|- Dihydroxyacetone phosphate|- Triosephosphate isomerase|- GAP|- Only GAP can be utilized in glycolysis: In fact, GAP and DHAP exist in equilibrium. However, since GAP is immediately utilized further in glycolysis, the equilibrium shifts, leading to an increased conversion of DHAP to GAP.|

> [!NOTE]
> In glycolysis, 2 ATP are invested and 4 ATP are gained, resulting in a net yield of 2 ATP!

> [!NOTE]
> Net reaction: Glucose + 2 Pi + 2 ADP + 2 NAD+ → 2 Pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2 H+ + 2 H2O!

## Regulation of Glycolysis

The reaction rate of glycolysis is determined by the general metabolic situation and is subject to both allosteric and hormonal regulation of its key enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase 1, and pyruvate kinase.

### Allosteric Regulation

- Allosteric regulation of hexokinase
    - Inhibition by: Glucose-6-phosphate
    - The hexokinase of the liver (hexokinase IV = glucokinase) has a lower affinity for glucose than hexokinases from other tissues.
- Allosteric regulation of phosphofructokinase 1 (the key enzyme of glycolysis)
    - Inhibition by
        - ATP
        - Decrease of the pH value
        - Citrate
    - Activation by
        - AMP
        - Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate: Allosteric activator in the sense of feed-forward regulation
            - Education: Through the bifunctional enzyme PFKFB (Phosphofructokinase 2/Fructose-2,6-Bisphosphatase)
                - Occurrence: There are four isoforms of PFKFB that are expressed in different tissues (e.g., PFKFB 1 in the liver, PFKFB 2 in the heart muscle)
                - Regulation: Hormonal Regulation (mediated via cAMP)
                    - PFKFB 1 (Liver): Increased cAMP levels deactivate the kinase domain and activate the phosphatase domain: Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is broken down more; glycolysis is inhibited.
                    - PFKFB 2 (Heart): Elevated cAMP levels activate the kinase domain and deactivate the phosphatase domain: Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is produced in increased amounts; glycolysis is activated.
- Allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase
    - Inhibition by ATP
    - Inhibition by Alanine
    - Activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate

### Hormonal Regulation

Only the hexokinase is subject to hormonal regulation at the transcriptional level by the antagonists insulin and glucagon.

- Insulin: Increases the transcription of the gene for hexokinase (hexokinase II and glucokinase)
- Glucagon: Reduces the transcription of the gene for hexokinase.

## Further Utilization of Pyruvate

The pyruvate produced in glycolysis can be further processed by the cells in two different ways: In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, which can be fed into the citric acid cycle (so-called aerobic glycolysis). If the cell does not have oxygen available or there is a pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, pyruvate is reduced to lactate in the lactate dehydrogenase reaction. This reaction is less about energy production and more about regenerating the NAD+ consumed in glycolysis.

### Aerobic Reutilization of Pyruvate (aerobic glycolysis)

Under aerobic conditions (that is, in the presence of oxygen), the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is converted to acetyl-CoA in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. This reaction serves as a link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.

- Definition: Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and thus the connection between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
- Goal: Maximization of energy extraction from glucose in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis)
- Location: Mitochondrial Matrix
- Enzyme: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex
- Starting material: Pyruvate
- Reaction steps: Pyruvate → Hydroxyethyl group → Acetyl group → Acetyl-CoA

> [!NOTE]
> The pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is irreversible, meaning that acetyl-CoA cannot be converted back into pyruvate. Therefore, acetyl-CoA is not a product for gluconeogenesis!

#### The Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex

The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a multi-enzyme complex that consists of three enzymes. These three enzymes require a total of five cofactors.

- Enzyme of the PDH complex
    1. Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (E1)
    2. Dihydrolipoyl-Transacetylase (E2)
    3. Dihydrolipoyl-Dehydrogenase (E3)
- Cofactors of the PDH complex
    1. Thiamine Pyrophosphate (TPP)
    2. Lipoic acid/lipoamide
    3. Coenzyme A
    4. FAD
    5. NAD+

> [!NOTE]
> The five cofactors of the PDH complex: Animals Love Cola and Fantastic Food (Thiamine pyrophosphate, Lipoamide, Coenzyme A, FAD, NAD+)!

#### Reactions of the PDH Complex

The glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, while the PDH reaction occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria. Pyruvate is therefore transported into the mitochondrion using a pyruvate carrier (pyruvate/H+-symport or pyruvate/OH-antipport). Here, the PDH complex begins the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

|Reactions|Substrate|Enzyme|Product|Cofactors|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Decarboxylation of Pyruvate|- Pyruvate|- Pyruvate Dehydrogenase|- Hydroxyethyl-TPP<br>- CO2|- Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)|
|2. Oxidation of Hydroxyethyl Residues|- Hydroxyethyl-TPP|- Pyruvate Dehydrogenase|- Acetyl-Lipoamide|- Lipoic Acid, bound to Dihydrolipoamide Transacetylase|
|3. Transfer of acetyl groups to CoA|- Acetyl-lipoamide|- Dihydrolipoamide transacetylase|- Acetyl-CoA<br>- Dihydrolipoamide|- Coenzyme A|
|4. Regeneration of Dihydro-Liponamides (Oxidation)|- Dihydro-Liponamide|- Dihydrolipoyl-Dehydrogenase|- Liponamide|- FAD<br>- NAD+|

> [!NOTE] Primary biliary cholangitis
> The primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disease of the liver, in which autoantibodies against the body's own mitochondria (so-called anti-mitochondrial antibodies = AMA) are formed. These target the dihydrolipoamide transacetylase, which is the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The disease initially manifests ("primary") in the small intrahepatic bile ducts ("biliary"), which are slowly destroyed by inflammatory processes ("cholangitis"). In the final stage, liver cirrhosis can occur, which is why the disease is also referred to as "primary biliary cirrhosis."

#### Regulation of the PDH Complex

The PDH complex is regulated both allosterically and hormonally.

1. Allosteric Regulation: Through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the PDH complex is inhibited or activated.
    - Phosphorylation by a specific kinase inhibits the PDH complex
    - Dephosphorylation by a specific phosphatase activates the PDH complex.
2. Hormonal Regulation
    - Insulin: Activates the PDH complex
    - Catecholamines: Activate the specific phosphatase, which then dephosphorylates the PDH complex, thereby activating it.

> [!NOTE]
> As the reaction products of the PDH complex accumulate, they can also directly (without going through phosphorylation) inhibit enzymes of the complex. The dihydrolipoate transacetylase (E2) is, for example, inhibited by acetyl-CoA, while the dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase (E3) is inhibited by NADH+H+!

> [!NOTE]
> With sufficient energy supply to the cell, the PDH complex is inactive; in case of energy deficiency, it is active!

### Anaerobic Further Utilization of Pyruvate (Anaerobic Glycolysis)

The anaerobic conversion of pyruvate takes place, just like glycolysis itself, in the cytosol. Here, pyruvate is converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. This primarily serves to regenerate NAD+.

- Definition: Reduction of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic conditions
- Goal: Regeneration of NAD+
- Enzyme: Lactate Dehydrogenase
- Process: Pyruvate + NADH+H+ ⇄ Lactate + NAD+

> [!NOTE]
> The balance equation of anaerobic glycolysis is: Glucose + 2 Pi + 2 ADP → 2 Lactate + 2 ATP + 2 H2O!

> [!NOTE]
> Under anaerobic conditions, NAD+ is regenerated by lactate dehydrogenase, while under aerobic conditions it occurs through the respiratory chain!

> [!NOTE] Labor value LDH
> The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is physiologically present in small amounts in the serum. Under certain pathological conditions, an increase in LDH concentration can occur. This is always the case when many cells die (e.g., in the context of a heart attack or also in hemolysis). See also myocardial infarction and signs of hemolysis.

> [!NOTE] Warburg Effect
> The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDHK) regulates the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase. In its active state, it inhibits the PDH through phosphorylation and thus also the aerobic glycolysis. The anaerobic glycolysis occurs to a greater extent. It is typical for many cancer cells that they also generate ATP through anaerobic glycolysis under oxidative conditions. This "Warburg effect" is based, among other things, on the activation of the PDHK and therefore provides a target in tumor therapy.

## Energy Balance of Glycolysis

In glycolysis, ATP is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation. Under anaerobic conditions, the energy yield is poor: Two ATP are invested at the beginning, and 4 ATP are produced, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP. Only under aerobic conditions can the reaction product pyruvate be fed into the citric acid cycle and ultimately into the electron transport chain via the PDH reaction. Here, significantly more energy is generated through oxidative phosphorylation.

### Substrate Chain Phosphorylation

- Definition: ATP synthesis by transferring a phosphate group from the intermediate product of a metabolic pathway (e.g., glycolysis) to ADP.
- Process
    1. Transfer of an inorganic phosphate to an intermediate of a metabolic pathway
    2. Further processing of the intermediate product
    3. Enzymatic transfer of the phosphate group to an ADP, resulting in ATP
- Examples in glycolysis
    - Reaction of phosphoglycerate kinase
    - Reaction of pyruvate kinase

### Energy Balance of Anaerobic Glycolysis

Under anaerobic conditions, the end product of glucose breakdown is lactate. From one molecule of glucose, two molecules of ATP can be obtained.

Energy balance of anaerobic glycolysis: Glucose + 2 Pi + 2 ADP → 2 Lactate + 2 ATP + 2 H2O!

### Energy Balance of Aerobic Glycolysis

Under aerobic conditions, glucose is oxidized to CO2 and H2O in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the respiratory chain. From one molecule of glucose, about 32 molecules of ATP can be produced.

> [!NOTE]
> The overall energy balance of glucose breakdown under aerobic conditions is +32 ATP!

## Hexosemonophosphate pathway (Pentose phosphate pathway)

- Definition: The hexose monophosphate pathway (also known as the pentose phosphate pathway) is an alternative breakdown pathway of glucose that branches off from glycolysis.
- Goal
    - Formation of NADPH+H+
    - Formation of pentoses, which are needed for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, ATP, NADH, and FAD
- Location: Cytosol of all cells (albeit with varying activity)
    - High activity, e.g., in the cells of the adrenal cortex and liver
- Key enzyme: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase

### Reactions of the Hexose Monophosphate Pathway

- Oxidative Phase: Glucose reacts in three steps to ribulose-5-phosphate, producing two molecules of NADPH+H+.
- Non-oxidative phase: Ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into other carbohydrates with three, four, five, six, and seven carbon atoms.
    - Takes place mainly in cells that require NADPH+H+, but not ribulose-5-phosphate.
    - Has fructose-6-phosphate and GAP as end products, which can be fed into glycolysis.
    - In cells that require particularly high amounts of pentoses for the synthesis of RNA, DNA, etc., the non-oxidative phase can also proceed in reverse.
    - Principle:
        - C5 + C5 ↔︎ C3 + C7
        - C3 + C7 ↔︎ C6 + C4
        - C4 + C5 ↔︎ C3 + C6

### Regulation of the Hexose Monophosphate Pathway

- Starting point - for both glycolysis and the hexose monophosphate pathway - is glucose-6-phosphate.
- The cell's demand determines which metabolic pathway will be followed.
    - Scenario 1: The cell mainly requires NADPH+H+
        - Glucose-6-phosphate undergoes the complete pentose phosphate pathway: Two molecules of NADPH+H+ are produced.
        - From the end products, glucose-6-phosphate is synthesized again through gluconeogenesis.
        - This can re-enter the pentose phosphate pathway.
    - Scenario 2: The cell primarily requires pentoses:
        - Breakdown of glucose-6-phosphate in glycolysis
        - In the process, fructose-6-phosphate and GAP are formed.
        - They go through the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway in reverse order.
        - End product: Ribose-5-phosphate
    - Scenario 3: The cell requires both NADPH+H+ and pentoses.
        - Glucose-6-phosphate is increasingly broken down via the pentose phosphate pathway.
        - This ends with ribose-5-phosphate
    - Scenario 4: The cell requires NADPH+H+ and ATP
        - Glucose-6-phosphate is initially broken down in the pentose phosphate pathway.
        - End products GAP and fructose-6-phosphate are then introduced into glycolysis.

## Gluconeogenesis

- Definition: Formation of glucose from two molecules of pyruvate
- Meaning: Under normal metabolic conditions, the glucose from food and glycogen breakdown is sufficient to supply the tissues that exclusively meet their energy needs through glucose (brain, anaerobically working skeletal muscle, erythrocytes, and renal medulla). Only during periods of prolonged food deprivation (>24 h) must glucose be synthesized by the body.
- Location: In liver cells (and to a lesser extent in kidney cells) in three cellular compartments (the first steps take place in mitochondria, the majority of the reactions occur in the cytosol, and the final step occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum)
- Starting materials
    - Lactate: Constantly available substrate for gluconeogenesis, it is directly converted to pyruvate.
    - Glucogenic amino acids (e.g. alanine): They originate from the breakdown of dietary proteins or (during periods of hunger) proteins from skeletal muscle, and are converted into oxaloacetate or pyruvate.
    - Glycerin: Comes from the breakdown of triacylglycerols through lipolysis. Glycerin is converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and then supplied to gluconeogenesis or glycolysis via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
    - Propionyl-CoA: From the breakdown of odd-chain fatty acids and some amino acids (methionine, valine, threonine, isoleucine)
        - Propionyl-CoA is first converted into Methylmalonyl-CoA, then into Succinyl-CoA, which is introduced into the citric acid cycle and converted into Oxaloacetate.
- Principle: Inverted glycolysis, except for the reactions of the three key enzymes of glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase 1, hexokinase), which must be replaced by gluconeogenesis-specific enzymes.
- Sequence: Pyruvate → Oxaloacetate → Phosphoenolpyruvate → 2-Phosphoglycerate → 3-Phosphoglycerate → 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate → Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate → Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate → Fructose-6-phosphate → Glucose-6-phosphate → Glucose

> [!NOTE]
> The gluconeogenesis is not simply the reversal of glycolysis. The reactions of the key enzymes of glycolysis are irreversible for thermodynamic reasons and must be replaced by gluconeogenesis-specific reactions! The other reactions are catalyzed by the same enzymes in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, with the direction of the reaction being determined by the concentration ratios of the metabolites.

### Gluconeogenesis-specific reactions

#### 1. Bypassing Pyruvate Kinase

1. Pyruvate carboxylase reaction: Conversion of pyruvate into oxaloacetate
    - Reaction consumes one molecule of ATP
    - Coenzyme: Biotin
2. Transport into the cytosol
    - The mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to oxaloacetate.
    - Transport occurs via the malate-aspartate shuttle.
3. Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase: Conversion of oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate
    - Rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis
    - Consumes one molecule of GTP and releases one molecule of CO2 (decarboxylation)

#### 2. Bypassing Phosphofructokinase 1

- Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase: Hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate
    - Thus, exactly the energy that was invested in the form of ATP during the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase 1 of glycolysis is lost again.
    - Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency can lead to lactic acidosis, among other things.

#### 3. Bypassing of Hexokinase

- Glucose-6-Phosphatase: Integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum of kidney and liver cells that hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose and Pi.
    - Here, exactly the energy that was invested in the glycolysis by the hexokinase in the form of ATP is lost again.
    - Free glucose can leave the cell via facilitated diffusion through GLUTs.

> [!NOTE]
> Phosphorylated glucose cannot leave the cell, so the glucose-6-phosphatase reaction is essential for organs involved in regulating blood sugar levels (liver and kidneys)!

> [!NOTE] Gierke's disease
> A defect in glucose-6-phosphatase leads to the inability of glucose-6-phosphate, formed in gluconeogenesis (or released from glycogen in glycogenolysis), to be dephosphorylated and consequently prevents it from leaving the cell. The resulting clinical picture is referred to as von Gierke's disease and belongs to the group of glycogenoses ("glycogen storage diseases"). It manifests in infants with life-threatening hypoglycemias and resulting epileptic seizures as well as acidoses.

### Energy Balance of Gluconeogenesis

- In gluconeogenesis, a total of six molecules of energy-rich compounds (four molecules of ATP and two molecules of GTP) are consumed.
    - Two molecules of pyruvate are required per glucose molecule.
    - During the conversion of pyruvate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, a total of two molecules of ATP and one molecule of GTP are consumed.
- If the glucose produced in this way is broken down in the target organ (e.g., brain), only two molecules of ATP are produced.
- In total, gluconeogenesis "costs" two molecules of ATP and two molecules of GTP.

> [!NOTE]
> Gluconeogenesis is not driven by a lack of energy, but by a lack of glucose, meaning an insufficient blood sugar level!

### Regulation of Gluconeogenesis

Similar to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis is regulated both allosterically and hormonally through its key enzymes pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.

- Allosteric Regulation
    1. Pyruvate carboxylase
        - Inhibition by ADP
        - Activation by Acetyl-CoA
    2. Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase
        - Inhibition by ADP
    3. Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphatase
        - Inhibition by Fructose-2,6-Bisphosphate
        - Inhibition by AMP
        - Activation by citrate
- Hormonal Regulation
    - Insulin: Inhibits gluconeogenesis (especially by inhibiting the expression of its key enzymes)
    - Glucagon: Activates gluconeogenesis (primarily through increased expression of the gluconeogenesis enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase)

## Review Questions on the Chapter Breakdown and Synthesis of Glucose
### Glycolysis

Describe the first steps of glycolysis up to the formation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate!
- In the first step of glycolysis, glucose is initially converted by hexokinase into glucose-6-phosphate, after which it can no longer leave the cell. Glucose-6-phosphate is then isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate. The phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase 1 and represents the rate-limiting reaction of glycolysis.

Which is the first energy-producing reaction of glycolysis and what type of reaction is it? Does the reaction also occur in reverse?
- During the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BIP) to 3-phosphoglycerate by phosphoglycerate kinase, one molecule of ATP is formed. This is the first of two energy-producing reactions in glycolysis. The phosphate group at the C1 atom of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is transferred onto ADP via substrate-level phosphorylation. This reaction is reversible and occurs in reverse during gluconeogenesis.

The product formed by the phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) is 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and it is an example of a phosphorylation reaction.
- During the phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) by GAP dehydrogenase, the important intermediate 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) is formed. It is a redox reaction in which NAD+ is reduced to NADH+H+.

How does the liver-specific isoform of hexokinase differ from that of skeletal muscle?
- The hexokinase of the liver (= glucokinase) has a significantly lower affinity for glucose than that of skeletal muscle. Thus, the liver only stores glucose in the form of glycogen at high blood sugar levels, ensuring that at lower concentrations, the supply of extrahepatic tissues is prioritized.

Through which mechanisms is glycolysis inhibited in the liver at low blood sugar levels?
- At low blood sugar levels, glucagon is released, which binds to G-protein-coupled receptors of hepatocytes. The resulting increase in intracellular cAMP levels activates protein kinase A, which in turn deactivates the kinase domain of the enzyme PFKFB (phosphofructokinase 2 / fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase) and activates its bisphosphatase domain. PFKFB catalyzes the synthesis and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which acts as an allosteric activator of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, phosphofructokinase 1. In this case, the activated bisphosphatase domain of PFKFB promotes the breakdown of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate – glycolysis is inhibited.

How and where is the end product of glycolysis metabolized further under aerobic conditions? What type of reaction is involved?
- The pyruvate formed in glycolysis is converted under aerobic conditions, i.e., in the presence of oxygen, in the mitochondrial matrix by the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction into acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can then enter the citric acid cycle. The pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is an irreversible reaction of the type oxidative decarboxylation.

Describe the reaction steps of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction (PDH reaction) and name the involved cofactors!
- As the first step of the PDH reaction, pyruvate is decarboxylated and the resulting hydroxyethyl residue is transferred onto the cofactor thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), forming hydroxyethyl-TPP. The hydroxyethyl residue is then oxidized to an acetyl group and transferred to lipoic acid. The formed acetyl-lipoylamide reacts with coenzyme A to form acetyl-CoA, the end product of the PDH reaction. In an additional step, lipoic acid is regenerated with the consumption of FAD and NAD+. The three enzymes of the PDH complex thus require a total of five cofactors.

Describe the further metabolism of pyruvate under anaerobic conditions! Name the location, involved enzymes, and purpose of the reactions!
- The anaerobic further metabolism of pyruvate (anaerobic glycolysis) takes place, like glycolysis, in the cytosol. Here, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. This mainly serves to regenerate NAD+ (pyruvate + NADH+H+ ⇄ lactate + NAD+).

### Hexose Monophosphate Pathway

What is the purpose of the hexose monophosphate pathway (= pentose phosphate pathway), in which organs does it primarily occur, and what is its key enzyme?
- The hexose monophosphate pathway is an alternative glucose degradation pathway branching off from glycolysis, which serves the production of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH+H+ as well as pentoses. The latter are required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, ATP, NADH, and FAD. In theory, it can occur in the cytosol of almost all cells but is especially active in the adrenal gland and liver. The key enzyme is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.

In what phases can the hexose monophosphate pathway be divided? Describe them briefly!
- The hexose monophosphate pathway can be divided into two phases: an oxidative and a non-oxidative phase. In the oxidative phase, glucose-6-phosphate is converted in three steps to ribulose-5-phosphate, with the formation of two molecules of NADPH+H+. Depending on the cell’s needs, the non-oxidative phase can follow, in which ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into other carbohydrates with three to seven carbon atoms. The end products are fructose-6-phosphate and GAP, which can be fed into glycolysis.

In which steps of the oxidative phase of the hexose monophosphate pathway is NADPH+H+ produced?
- In the first, rate-limiting reaction step of the oxidative phase of the hexose monophosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconolactone. In the last step, 6-phosphogluconate is decarboxylated to ribulose-5-phosphate. In both cases, one molecule of NADPH+H+ is generated.

What cofactor is required by transketolase in the non-oxidative phase of the hexose monophosphate pathway?
- In the second reaction step of the non-oxidative phase of the hexose monophosphate pathway, transketolase transfers a C2 unit from xylulose-5-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate, resulting in GAP and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate. The coenzyme for this reaction is thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP).

### Gluconeogenesis

Which substances serve as starting materials for the formation of glucose in gluconeogenesis?
- In gluconeogenesis, glucose can be newly formed from various precursors: from lactate obtained during anaerobic glycolysis, from glucogenic amino acids from the diet or, during starvation phases, from proteins of the skeletal muscle, from glycerol released in the lipolysis of TAGs, and from propionyl-CoA formed during the breakdown of odd-chain fatty acids and some amino acids.

Gluconeogenesis is not simply the reversal of glycolysis. Which reactions of glycolysis are irreversible and therefore must be bypassed in gluconeogenesis?
- The reactions catalyzed by key enzymes of glycolysis (pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase 1, hexokinase) are irreversible due to thermodynamic reasons and must be replaced by energy-consuming, gluconeogenesis-specific reactions.

Describe the reaction steps that are necessary in gluconeogenesis to bypass the pyruvate kinase reaction of glycolysis!
- Pyruvate kinase converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate in the last step of glycolysis. The reverse reaction accordingly represents the first step of gluconeogenesis. For this purpose, pyruvate is first converted by pyruvate carboxylase into oxaloacetate with the consumption of one molecule of ATP. This reaction takes place in the mitochondrion and requires biotin as a coenzyme. Subsequently, via the malate-aspartate shuttle, transport into the cytosol occurs where the rate-limiting reaction of gluconeogenesis takes place: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase converts oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, consuming one molecule of GTP.

What is the purpose of the reaction catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase and where does it take place (organ and cellular compartment)?
- In the last step of gluconeogenesis, glucose-6-phosphate must be dephosphorylated to glucose since only free glucose can exit the cell via glucose transporters (GLUT). This reaction takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase, an integral ER membrane protein found exclusively in liver and kidney cells.

Present the energy balance of gluconeogenesis!
- In gluconeogenesis, two molecules of pyruvate are needed per newly formed glucose molecule. For each molecule of pyruvate, two molecules of ATP and one molecule of GTP are consumed, thus a total of four ATP and two GTP per glucose molecule. Since the resulting glucose can later be catabolized in the target organ to gain two ATP molecules again, gluconeogenesis has an overall negative energy balance of two molecules each of ATP and GTP.
