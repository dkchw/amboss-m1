# Skin and Skin Appendages
## Summary

The skin is the largest organ of the human body and has several important functions: On one hand, it protects the integrity of the body from harmful environmental influences and pathogens. On the other hand, it allows for the controlled exchange with its environment regarding temperature regulation, UV-dependent vitamin D synthesis, and the transmission of sensory impressions.
The skin appendages can be classified into the highly specialized keratin products of the epidermis (hair and nails) and the dermal glands (sebaceous, sweat, and mammary glands). By the way, you can also find a Histo-Trainer episode on skin and skin appendages in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the skin.
## Structure of the Skin

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Skin

Macroscopically, the skin can be subdivided into

- Skin appendages: Here you will find all skin appendages including (sweat, scent, and sebaceous glands as well as hair)
- Glabrous skin
    - It is found only on the palmar sides of the hands as well as the plantar sides of the feet
    - In contrast to glabrous skin, thick skin only contains eccrine sweat glands (hair, sebaceous glands, and scent glands are absent!)

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Skin

The layers of the skin can be divided based on their histological structure (from superficial to deep) into the epidermis and subcutis. The epidermis can further be divided into the epidermis and dermis. The main cell type within the epidermis is the keratinocyte, which makes up about 90% of the epidermal cells. The remaining 10% consists of three additional cell types: melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells.

- Skin
    - Epidermis: The layers of the epidermis are determined by the degree of differentiation of the keratinocytes (see below)
    - Dermis
        - Papillary layer
            - Consists of loose connective tissue
            - Includes neural cells (Meissner's corpuscles, free nerve endings), immune cells (mast cells, macrophages) and at the boundary between the papillary and reticular dermis the superficial vascular plexus (plexus superficialis)
        - Reticular layer
            - Consists of dense connective tissue
            - Contains connective tissue cells, immune cells, hair follicles, receptors (Ruffini corpuscles), glands, blood and lymphatic vessels
            - Includes at the boundary between Dermis and Subcutis the deep vascular plexus (plexus profundus)
- Dermal-epidermal junction zone
    - Anchoring of the stratum basale with the papillary dermis via the basement membrane
    - Molecular compound through a variety of protein complexes
- Subcutis

#### Structure of the epidermis (= stratified keratinized squamous epithelium)

The epithelial cells that produce keratin in the skin are called keratinocytes. Depending on the degree of differentiation and appearance of the keratinocytes, five layers are distinguished within the epidermis.

- Development: See Development of the Epidermis
- Appearance
    - Stratum basale (Basal Cell Layer)
        - Iso- bis high-prismatic cell body
        - Individual nuclei show mitotic figures
    - Stratum spinosum (spiny cell layer)
        - Polygonal Cell Body
        - Desmosome contacts between the cells are clearly visible → Cell membrane appears "spiky"
    - Stratum granulosum (skin) (granular cell layer)
        - Spindle-shaped cell body
        - In the cytoplasm, there are many granule-like keratohyalin granules.
        - Keratohyalin: Large protein complexes consisting of keratin precursor protein and profilaggrin (large protein that facilitates the cross-linking of keratin filaments via disulfide bridges)
        - Tight Junctions for the maintenance of the epithelial barrier
    - Stratum lucidum (Clear layer)
        - Visible manifestation only in the groin skin
        - Homogeneous eosinophilic layer
        - Remnants of the cell nucleus may still be present.
    - Stratum corneum (horny layer): Completely keratinized, avital cells without a nucleus or organelles (they are referred to as corneocytes or horny cells )
        - Narrow manifestation in the Felderhaut
        - Broad expression in the stratum corneum
- Function
    - Melanin deposition
    - Horny layer made of keratin (stratum corneum)
        - "Brick Mortar" Model
            - Interlocking of cells via Tight Junctions
            - Sealing of the intercellular space via ceramides (polar lipids)
    - Regeneration of the epidermis

#### Melanocytes

- Development: Ectoderm germ layer → Neural crest → Melanocytes
- Appearance
    - Heller Cell Body
    - May contain brown pigment
- Localization: Stratum basale
- Function: Melanin biosynthesis (UV protection of the skin; see: Melanin)

#### Merkel Cells

- Development: Ectoderm germ layer → Epidermal stem cells → Merkel cells
- Appearance: See: Touch and Feel
- Localization: Stratum basale
- Function: Pressure receptors of the skin (see: Touch and Feel)

#### Langerhans cells

- Development: Mesoderm germ layer → Hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow → Monocytes → Langerhans cells
- Appearance: Bright, heavily branched cell body
- Localization: Stratum spinosum
- Function: Dendritic Cell of the Epidermis (Antigen-presenting cell)
## Functions of the Skin

As an intermediary between the body's environment and the surroundings, the skin fulfills multiple functions: it protects body cells from mutagenic UV radiation through pigment synthesis (melanin) and plays a central role in regulating body temperature through perspiration (which is sweating). Additionally, it enables us to interact with the outside world through its mechanosensors. The biosynthesis and function of melanin will be presented in more detail in this section due to its special significance.

### Functions at a Glance

- Protective barrier against environmental influences
    - Melanin biosynthesis
- Transmission of sensory stimuli
    - Sense of taste
    - Thermoception (see: temperature sense)
    - Noziception (see: Nociceptive System)
- Vitamin-D-Biosynthesis (see Calciferol)
- Thermoregulation (see: Metabolism of the Skin)

> [!NOTE] Burning of the Skin
> Burns are thermal tissue injuries that impair the protective, sensory, and thermoregulation functions of the skin. Due to the loss of barrier function and tissue damage, significant fluid loss and infection may occur. Depending on the tissue depth of the burn, four grades are distinguished. The extent of the affected body surface in adults can be estimated using the Rule of Nines by Wallace. According to this rule, the body is divided into 11 regions, each accounting for approximately 9% of the body surface area (head, arms, upper/lower anterior trunk, upper/lower back, thighs, lower legs), and one region (the genital area), which is calculated at 1% (11 × 9% + 1% = 100%). Depending on the extent, surgical treatment or care in a burn center may be necessary.

### Melanin

In this section, melanins are presented in more detail due to their special significance for skin protection: Melanins are a group of pigments that occur within many living beings. They serve to protect against potentially mutagenic UV radiation from the sun and are responsible for the coloration of skin and hair. In humans, only two forms play a role: brown-black eumelanin and yellow-red pheomelanin.

#### Definition

- Melanin: Group of dyes (pigments) in living beings that serve to protect against mutagenic solar radiation (especially UV-B)
    - Eumelanin
        - Brown-black pigment
        - Dominates in dark skin-/hair tones
    - Pheomelanin
        - Yellowish-red pigment ("freckle pigment")
        - Dominates in light skin-/hair colors (blonde, redhead)

#### Biosynthesis (Melanogenesis)

The melanogenesis simply describes a polymerization of derivatives of the amino acid tyrosine.

- Localization: Melanosomes
    - Definition: Special membrane-bound cell organelles of the melanocytes, in which melanins are produced and stored.
    - Origin: From vesicles of the Golgi apparatus, which is why they are most closely related to lysosomes.
- Process of synthesis
    - Eumelanin: Tyrosine → Dopa → Dopachrome → Dihydroxyindole → Eumelanin
    - Pheomelanin: Tyrosine → Dopa → Dopachrome → Cysteinyldopa → Pheomelanin
- Key enzyme: Tyrosinase
    - Catalyzes the first two reactions of both synthesis pathways (up to the intermediate product dopachrome)
- Pigment transfer to keratinocytes
    - The resulting melanins accumulate in the melanosomes.
    - Melanosomes are transported into the dendrites of the melanocytes
    - The dendrites release the melanosomes to neighboring keratinocytes (so-called pigment transfer), which take them up for their own protection.
- Regulation of melanogenesis
    - Genetic: The basal melanogenesis of a person is genetically determined.
        - Quantitative influence: The melanosomes and enzyme composition of the melanocytes varies.
        - Qualitative impact: Depending on the preferred synthesis pathway (eumelanin or pheomelanin), the resulting hue varies.
    - Sunlight: UV radiation stimulates melanogenesis through two mechanisms.
        - Enzyme activation: Key enzyme of melanogenesis (tyrosinase) is activated.
        - Melanocyte growth: The number of melanosomes and dendrites is increased.
    - Hormonal
        - MSH-RH from the hypothalamus stimulates the production of MSH
        - Melanocyte-inhibiting hormone inhibits the release of MSH
        - MSH (Melanocyte-stimulating hormone) stimulates melanocyte growth (as described above)
            - Is formed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus as well as in the adenohypophysis as a split product of POMC

> [!NOTE] Albinism due to tyrosinase deficiency
> The most common cause of albinism in Europe is a mutation in the TYR-gene, which encodes for tyrosinase. As a result, the synthesis of melanin is only limited or does not occur at all. Affected individuals have light skin, white hair, and light blue eyes. Since melanin is also required for the development of the eye, affected individuals almost always have very low visual acuity, frequently squint, and exhibit uncontrolled eye movements (nystagmus).

> [!NOTE] Hyperpigmentation in Addison's disease
> An adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) leads to low cortisol concentrations in the blood with symptoms such as weakness and weight loss. Therefore, in the pituitary gland, more ACTH is produced, which is supposed to stimulate the production of cortisol. Since ACTH is formed from the cleavage of proopiomelanocortin, a byproduct, the melanin-stimulating hormone (MSH) is produced. The melanocytes present in the skin are thus stimulated to increase melanin production. Patients with Addison's disease therefore additionally have an unusually brown skin tone.

#### Function of Melanin

The role of melanin is to convert mutagenic radiation energy (UV-B) into harmless thermal energy.

- Principle: So-called "ultrafast internal transformation" of melanin
    1. The ultraviolet radiation of sunlight increases the energy level of the electrons in the melanin molecule (so-called excited state)
    2. The excited state causes the molecule to vibrate (so-called vibrational state)
    3. The vibration state releases harmless thermal energy.
- Differences: This UV filter function is highly pronounced in eumelanin and low in pheomelanin (especially lower UV protection in light-skinned/red-haired individuals)

#### Formation of skin and hair colors

- Principle: Every person possesses both eumelanin and pheomelanin pigments, only the mixing ratio of these dyes determines a person's hair color and skin tone (Skin Type).
    - Dark shades: Eumelanin > Pheomelanin
    - Light colors: Eumelanin < Pheomelanin

> [!NOTE]
> The skin type is determined solely by the amount and the mixing ratio of the melanins, and not by the number of melanocytes!

> [!NOTE]
> Do not confuse: Melanin = pigment produced from tyrosine in skin and hair for UV protection! Melatonin = hormone produced from serotonin in the pineal gland for regulating the sleep-wake cycle!

## Appendages: Hair and Nails

With the term “appendages of the skin”, we refer to body structures that have originated from cells of the epidermis (epidermis) and still have a direct connection to the skin. A total of five forms are distinguished. Among them are two structures composed of horn (keratin) that are visible to the naked eye: hair and the fingernails or toenails. In addition, there are three types of skin glands: namely the sebaceous, sweat, and mammary glands (glandula mammaria). In this section, due to their similarities in structure, the two keratin products in the form of hair and nails will be discussed first.

### The basic substance of hair and nails

To understand the special mechanical properties of hair and nails, one must get acquainted with their structure made up of the special protein molecule keratin. The keratin accumulates in the keratinocytes of the hair and nail roots, which subsequently keratinize. Once these cells have reached their maximum content of keratin, their cellular metabolism ceases, and they form the hair shaft or the nail plate as dead horn cells.

#### Keratin: The Structural Protein

Keratin is a structural protein that forms part of the cytoskeleton in all epithelia. Furthermore, keratin is the molecular building block of hair, nails, and the so-called stratum corneum (Stratum corneum) of the epidermis.

- Definition: Group of fiber-forming structural proteins that provide mechanical stability due to their ability to form intermediate filaments
- Structure: There are about 20 different types of keratin, which, however, share common characteristics.
    - Common features
        - Contain a lot of Cysteine, which provides stability through disulfide bridges.
        - Ultrastructure: α-Helix → Intermediate filament → Macrofibril
- Function
    - General
        - As intermediate filaments involved in the cytoskeleton of all epithelial cells
        - Anchoring of cells via desmosomes/hemidesmosomes
    - Hair/Nails: As a macrofibril, it forms the molecular basic substance of hair and nails.
        - Use of special "hard" keratins, which contain particularly high levels of cysteine (up to 20% of all amino acids in the keratin molecule)

#### The Process of Keratinization

Keratinization (Cornification) is the transformation of keratinocytes into dead, nucleated horn cells. These have neither a nucleus nor organelles, instead containing only keratin.

- Occurrence of keratinization in the body
    - Skin: The stratum corneum is formed by keratinization of the epidermis and serves as a protective barrier.
    - Epidermal appendages: The length growth of hair and nails occurs through keratinization
- Process
    1. Cell division of the keratinocytes for a permanent supply of cells during the keratinization process
    2. Keratin synthesis from the keratogenic zone
    3. Migration of the cells distally, during which their keratin content increases.
    4. Cell death

### Hair

Hair is a keratin product formed by epidermal cells in hair follicles. The structure of hair changes over the course of life, allowing for the distinction of various types of hair.

#### Function of Hair

- Skin protection: Against moisture, UV radiation (see: Function of melanin)
- Thermal insulation
- Social Function

#### Structure of the hair follicles and the hair

Each hair forms a functional unit together with a sebaceous gland and a small smooth muscle (M. arrector pili), which is located in an indentation of the epidermis (hair follicle). A single hair consists of three zones in cross-section.

- Hair follicle: An invagination of the epidermis in which a functional unit consisting of the following three structures is located.

    1. Hair: Attachment in the follicle
    2. Salivary gland
    3. M. arrector pili: Arrector Pili Muscle
        - Origin: Upper Dermis
        - Ansatz: Connective tissue hair follicle sheath
        - Function: Raising the hair for cold protection (commonly known as goosebumps)
        - Innervation: Noradrenergic Sympathetic

    - Structure: Epithelial root sheaths encase the hair root and hair shaft.
        - Inner epithelial root sheath, consisting of three layers (from innermost to outermost):
            - Vaginal cuticle
            - Huxley layer
            - Henle layer
        - Outer epithelial root sheath
            - Goes into the epidermis in the hair funnel

#### The Hair Types

In humans, there are three types of hair: lanugo, vellus, and terminal hair. They differ in age-dependent growth and their structure.

> [!NOTE] Hair as maturity signs of the newborn
> In a full-term newborn, the lanugo hair should be completely or at least partially absent. Starting from the sixth month of life, it is then replaced by vellus hair. The more lanugo hair that is still present on the newborn, the lower the maturity level of the child must be assessed.

> [!NOTE] Lanugobehaarung as a symptom of Anorexia nervosa (Anorexia)
> Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that occurs frequently in women during adolescence, with its main cause being a distorted self-perception and an exaggerated fear of weight gain (so-called body image disturbance). As a result, due to low food intake and other weight reduction measures (induced vomiting, laxatives, excessive exercise), life-threatening underweight (cachexia) can occur. A symptom or warning sign of this disease is the reappearance of fine lanugo body hair, which is physiologically only visible in fetuses or newborns. It is believed that this lanugo hair is a reaction of the body to compensate for the lack of cold protection due to the severely reduced subcutaneous fat tissue.

#### Hair Growth Cycle

Hair growth follows a continuous cycle that consists of three phases: Anagen, Catagen, and Telogen. The hair follicle re-enters the first phase after completing the third.

> [!NOTE] Alopecia androgenetica
> In the case of androgenetic alopecia, it is a hereditary hair loss that occurs in about 60-80% of men and therefore is not actually a pathology, but rather a normal variant. It usually occurs from early adulthood. The hair follicles atrophy and the anagen phase shortens. Androgens likely play a role; however, the process is not yet fully understood. As a result, the terminal hair transforms back into short fine vellus hair, and the scalp hair thins out.

### Fingernails and Toenails

Just like the hair, the nails are also a specialized keratin product of the epidermis. However, their growth does not occur in growth cycles, but continuously.

> [!NOTE] Ingrown toenail  
> Certain factors can cause painful lateral ingrowth of the nail into the nail fold. These include tight, pressing footwear, overly wide cutting of the nail corners, as well as strongly curved nail plates (so-called "spoon nails"). The ingrown nail is usually found on the lateral big toe. Due to chronic trauma to the nail fold and subsequent bacterial infection, severe chronic pain may occur. Therapeutically, the so-called Emmert procedure is often applied: The affected lateral third of the nail, along with the associated matrix portion, is excised in a wedge shape.

> [!NOTE] Nail Changes
> The nails can also be altered in a variety of skin diseases or systemic conditions and should always be examined during the physical examination. For example, characteristic spots can indicate psoriasis. The nails may be enlarged and rounded due to chronic hypoxia (clubbed nails).

## Appendages: Glands

There are three types of skin-associated glandular tissue: the sebaceous glands, the sweat glands, and the mammary gland, which is remodeled into the lactating mammary gland during a pregnancy in women.

### Talg- and sweat glands

The sebaceous and sweat glands are located in the dermis (dermis). They are either connected to the hair follicles or open freely onto the epidermis. There are two types of secretion in sweat glands.

| |   |Salivary Gland|Eccrine Sweat Gland|Apocrine Sweat Gland|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Synonyms|   |- Sebaceous gland|- Sweat gland, small, Eccrine sweat gland|- Sweat gland, large, Apocrine gland|
|Occurrence|Skin layer|- Upper Dermis|- Deep Dermis (Stratum reticulare) and upper Subcutis|- Deep Dermis|
|Body Areas|- Ubiquitous in the field skin<br>    - Highest density: face & back|- Ubiquitous in the skin<br>    - Highest density: groin skin and forehead|- Skin of the axilla, nipples, perigenital and perianal region|
|Mouth|   |- Majority: In hair follicles<br>- Remainder: On the epidermis (free sebaceous glands)|- On the epidermis|- In hair follicles|
|Function|   |- Sebum film for Hair/Skin: Contribution to the waterproof barrier of the Skin|- Perspiration: Thermoregulation<br>- Hydration of the Stratum corneum: Protection against drying out|- Not conclusively clarified|
|Regulation|   |- Stimulation: Androgens<br>- Inhibition<br>    - Retinoids<br>    - Hunger<br>    - Wound healing|- Stimulation<br>    - Body temperature↑<br>    - Sympathetic nervous system via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors|- Activity only starts from puberty<br>- Stimulation: Not conclusively clarified|
|Secretion Type|   |- Holocrine|- Eccrine (merocrine)|- Apocrine|
|Microscopic Structure|   |- Acini<br>    - Spherical arrangement of epithelial cells with lipid droplets<br>        - Peripherally located basal cells provide cell replacement<br>        - Increasing accumulation of lipid droplets and nuclear pyknosis towards the excretory duct<br>        - Near the excretory duct, cell decay (→ Holocrine secretion)<br>- Excretory Duct<br>    - Epidermal stratified squamous epithelium<br>    - Opening into hair follicles or freely onto epidermis|- Commonalities in structure<br>    - Acini<br>        - Luminal: Simple, cubic to high columnar epithelium<br>        - Basal: Myoepithelial cells<br>    - Excretory duct: Two-layered, cubic epithelium|   |
|- End pieces: Small bundle with size-constant lumen |- End pieces: Large bundle with size-variable lumens |
|Special Forms|   |- Eyelid<br>    - Zeis glands: Opening into hair follicles of the eyelashes<br>    - Meibomian glands: Opening freely at the posterior edge of the eyelid (maintenance of the tear film)|–|- Eyelid: Moll glands<br>- External auditory canal: Ceruminous glands|

> [!NOTE]
> The sympathetic nervous system activates the eccrine sweat glands with the postganglionic neurotransmitter acetylcholine. For all other target organs, the sympathetic nervous system uses the postganglionic neurotransmitter norepinephrine!

> [!NOTE] Acne vulgaris
> Acne vulgaris ("common acne") refers to a bacterial inflammation of sebaceous glands and associated hair follicles, which occurs more frequently during puberty. Several triggering factors play a role in this: Initially, elevated androgen levels during puberty lead to hypertrophy of the sebaceous glands with increased sebum production. At the same time, affected individuals often have increased keratin production in the follicular epidermis, leading to the formation of a comedone plug (commonly known as "blackheads") from sebum and keratin. Below the comedo, physiologically occurring Corynebacteria find optimal growth conditions in the follicle. They feed on the accumulated sebum and break down the contained triglycerides into free fatty acids, which have pro-inflammatory effects and attract leukocytes through chemotaxis. As a result, the typical acne-related pus-filled inflamed follicles develop (commonly referred to as "pimples").

> [!NOTE] Chalazion (Hordeolum) and Hordeolum (Hordeolum)
> A chalazion is an inflammation of the Meibomian gland, often caused by a blockage of the ducts – it presents as a painless swelling in the eyelid. This distinguishes it from a stye – an acute bacterial inflammation of the Meibomian gland or a Moll or Zeis gland. The stye is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus, is painful, swollen, and reddened. It can be effectively treated locally with gentamicin, whereas with a chalazion, one usually waits and, if necessary, surgically removes it.

### Breast gland (Mammary gland)

Formally, the mammary gland is also classified as one of the skin-associated glands and thus belongs to the appendages of the skin. However, due to its unique physiology, it is discussed in the chapter on female sexuality.

### Development

This section provides an overview of the embryonic origin of skin and skin appendages. Due to low exam relevance, detailed developmental steps will not be further discussed. Only the development of the epidermis will be elaborated on at this point.

### Overview of the involved Germ Layers

- Skin: It develops from two of the three germ layers
    - Ectoderm → Epidermis (Outer skin)
    - Mesoderm → Dermis (Leather skin) and Subcutis (subcutaneous fat tissue)
- Epidermal appendages: Hair, nails, and all skin glands (Sebaceous, sweat-, mammary glands originate from the ectoderm.

### Development of the Epidermis

- Starting point: The body surface of the embryo is completely covered by the surface ectoderm (single-layered, isoprismatic epithelium)
- Development
    - 7th week: Surface ectoderm becomes high-prismatic and divides into two layers.
        - Basal layer (bottom): Single-layered, tall columnar epithelium
        - Periderm (above): Single-layered squamous epithelium
    - 11th week
        - Basal layer: Is the mitotically active stratum germinativum
            - From the stratum germinativum, a so-called intermediate layer arises.
                - The intermediate layer contains precursor cells of the later keratinocytes
        - Periderm: Cells begin to keratinize (see: process of keratinization)
    - 21st week
        - Basal layer: Forms the stratum basale
        - Periderm: Is completely shed
        - Intermediate layer: From it arise the three upper layers of the epidermis (stratum spinosum, granulosum, corneum)
## Review Questions for the Chapter on Skin and Skin Appendages
### Structure of the Skin

What are the differences between field skin and groin skin?
- Macroscopically, the skin can be distinguished into field skin and glabrous skin. Field skin covers 95% of the body surface and can carry all skin appendages (sweat, sebaceous, scent glands, and hairs). Glabrous skin is found only on the palmar sides of the hands and the plantar sides of the feet and, except for small sweat glands, shows no other skin appendages. In addition, the horny cell layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) is significantly thicker in the glabrous skin.

In which layer of the skin is the stratum papillare located, and what cells can be found there?
- The stratum papillare forms the upper layer of the dermis (and thus of the cutis) and is separated from the epidermis by the basal membrane. It consists of loose connective tissue, which contains Meissner's corpuscles and numerous defense cells (mast cells and macrophages).

Name the layers of the epidermis! Which cell type predominates?
- The main cell type within the epidermis is the keratinocyte (about 90% of all cells). Based on the progressive degree of differentiation (= keratinization) of the keratinocytes, five layers are distinguished from "inside to outside": stratum basale, spinosum, granulosum, lucidum, and corneum.

What function does the protein profilaggrin have in the epidermis?
- Profilaggrin is a large protein produced by keratinocytes in the stratum granulosum (granular layer) of the epidermis and is located in their keratohyalin granules. It crosslinks the keratin filaments there via disulfide bridges.

In which layer of the epidermis can both Merkel cells and melanocytes be found? What functions do the two cell types have?
- Merkel cells and melanocytes are located in the stratum basale of the epidermis. Merkel cells are important as pressure receptors for the sense of touch. Melanocytes produce melanin and thus protect the skin from harmful UV radiation.

### Functions of the Skin

What are melanosomes? Do you know of a related cell organelle?
- Melanosomes are special membrane-bound cell organelles of the melanocyte in which melanins are produced and stored. They originate from vesicles of the Golgi apparatus and possess some lysosomal proteins, which is why they are most closely related to lysosomes.

### Skin Appendages: Glands

What types of sweat glands do you know, and where do they each occur? Name the similarities and differences in their microscopic structure!
- Sweat glands can be distinguished by their secretion mechanism into apocrine and eccrine sweat glands. Eccrine sweat glands occur everywhere on the skin, while apocrine sweat glands are only found on the skin of the axilla, nipples, perigenital, and perianal regions. The ducts of both gland types consist of two-layered cuboidal epithelium; their convoluted secretory portions consist of single-layered cuboidal to tall columnar epithelium, with myoepithelial cells found at the base. The secretory portions can be distinguished by their lumen. Eccrine sweat glands have a rather small lumen, whereas apocrine sweat glands have a larger, variable lumen.

The ducts of the skin-associated glands either open freely onto the epidermis or are connected to hair follicles. Which types of glands correspond to each case?
- Skin-associated glands can be distinguished among other things by the opening of their ducts. The eccrine sweat glands always open freely on the stratum corneum of the epidermis, while apocrine sweat glands release their secretion into hair follicles. The majority of sebaceous glands are connected to hair follicles, but a small part opens directly on the epidermis.

How are the end pieces of the sebaceous glands microscopically structured and by what mechanism do they release their secretion?
- The secretory portions of the sebaceous glands consist of ball-shaped arranged epithelial cells whose cytoplasm contains numerous lipid vacuoles. They release their secretion by holocrine secretion, in which the entire gland cell becomes part of the secretion through apoptosis by breaking down into many small fragments.
