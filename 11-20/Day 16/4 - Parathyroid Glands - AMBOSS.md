# Parathyroid Glands
## Summary

The parathyroid glands (glandulae parathyreoideae) are small lens-shaped organs located dorsal to the thyroid gland. Despite their close spatial relationship, they should be considered functionally separate from the thyroid gland. They produce parathyroid hormone, which, along with calcitriol (vitamin D3), is central to calcium and phosphate metabolism. By the way, you can also find a histo trainer episode on the parathyroid glands as part of the episode on the endocrine organs in the section on microscopic anatomy of the parathyroid glands.
## Anatomy

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Parathyroid Glands

#### Profile

- Location: Dorsal of the thyroid gland between the two leaves of the thyroid capsule
- Number: Usually four (one upper and one lower parathyroid gland on each side)
- Shape: Lenticular
- Vascular supply and innervation of the parathyroid gland: see anatomy of the thyroid gland
- Size: 5x4x2mm
- Function: Formation of parathyroid hormone

#### Structure and Location

The parathyroid glands are located between the two layers of the thyroid capsule. They consist of closely packed epithelial and fat cells.

- Superior parathyroid glands: Upper (left and right) parathyroid glands
    - Location: Located in the dorsal part of the cranial third of the thyroid parenchyma, approximately at the level of the cricoid cartilage.
- Parathyroid glands inferior: Lower (left and right) parathyroid glands
    - Location: Usually at the level of the caudal sections of the dorsal thyroid lobe, but can extend into the thorax.

> [!NOTE]
> The number and location of the parathyroid glands vary; in particular, the location of the inferior parathyroid glands varies: for example, they can also be located intrathoracically!

> [!NOTE] Iatrogenic Hypoparathyroidism
> Due to their variable location and inconspicuous appearance, the parathyroid glands are particularly at risk during surgeries. If they are mistakenly removed, postoperative hypofunction with hypocalcemia occurs.

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Parathyroid Glands

The parathyroid glands are also called epithelial bodies, as they primarily consist of densely packed epithelial cells. Characteristic are the small hormone-producing chief cells. Histologically, three different cell types can be distinguished.

|Cell types of the parathyroid gland|   |
|---|---|
|Chief Cells (Parathyroid Gland)|- Appearance: Small polygonal cells with round nuclei<br>    - Light chief cells: Rich in glycogen<br>    - Dark chief cells: Low in glycogen<br>- Function: Production of parathyroid hormone|
|Oxyphilic Cells|- Appearance: Larger, acidophilic cells with a small nucleus<br>- Function: Still unknown|
|Univacuolar adipocytes| - They penetrate the epithelium of the parathyroid glands and can make up to 50% of the tissue|

### Origin

- Time: 5th-6th week after fertilization
- Development
    - Superior parathyroid glands: From the 4th pharyngeal pouch
    - Lower parathyroid glands: From the 3rd pharyngeal pouch
## Function: Calcium and Phosphate Balance

The function of the parathyroid glands is closely related to calcium and phosphate balance. Its hormone, parathyroid hormone, is alongside calcitriol the most important hormone for regulating calcium levels.

### Calcium and Phosphate Balance

The calcium and phosphate balance is a complex system with many influencing factors. The intake of calcium and phosphate through the intestine, renal excretion, as well as the incorporation and removal in the bone matrix are hormonally regulated by parathyroid hormone and calcitriol (vitamin D3). In addition to parathyroid hormone and calcitriol, there is also the thyroid hormone calcitonin, which, however, seems to play only a minor role in humans.

#### Overview: Regulation of Calcium and Phosphate Balance

- Parathyroid hormone
    - Task: Maintain constant calcium levels in the blood
- Calcitriol
    - Task: Homeostasis of calcium and phosphate levels; promotion of bone mineralization
- Calcitonin
    - Task: Physiological role unclear, rather no significance in humans.
    - Usable as a medication to lower calcium levels

> [!NOTE]
> Both parathyroid hormone and calcitriol increase calcium levels; however, parathyroid hormone does so at the expense of bones and vitamin D in their favor!

> [!NOTE]
> Calcitriol (Vitamin D) increases the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the blood. Parathyroid hormone provides calcium and lowers the phosphate level!

> [!NOTE] FGF23-related hypophosphatemia
> The Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) plays an important role in phosphate metabolism. It is classified as an endocrine FGF and inhibits renal phosphate reabsorption as well as calcitriol synthesis. If FGF23 is overproduced, for example, by a tumor, low serum levels of phosphate and calcitriol are the result; bone pain, fractures, and muscle weakness may occur.

#### Parathyroid Hormone (= PTH, Parathyrin)

Parath hormone increases the calcium level and lowers the phosphate level in the blood. It releases calcium from the bone by activating osteoclasts. At the same time, it promotes the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney; however, PTH does not have a direct effect on the intestine. Phosphate is also released from the bone under the influence of parath hormone, but it is also increasingly excreted through the kidney, resulting in an overall reduction of the serum phosphate level. This is sensible, as simultaneously high levels of calcium and phosphate promote the precipitation of calcium phosphate complexes in the blood.

- Properties
    - Peptide hormone
    - Hydrophilic
- Synthesis
    - Synthesis site: Chief cells of the parathyroid glands
    - Synthesis steps: Pre-Pro-PTH → Pro-PTH → PTH
- Storage: Secretory granules
- Secretion: Exocytosis
- Regulation: Distribution depending on the Ca2+ level
    - High extracellular calcium → Activation of calcium-sensitive receptors → Inhibition of PTH secretion
    - Low extracellular calcium → Inhibition of calcium-sensitive receptors → Increase in PTH secretion
- Effect
    - Target organs: Primarily bones, additionally kidneys and (indirectly through increased calcitriol synthesis) intestines
    - Effects:
        - Increase in calcium levels in the blood
        - Reduction of phosphate levels in the blood
    - Molecular mode of action
        - Osteoclasts do not have PTH receptors.
        - Effect is mediated through the RANK-RANKL system.
            1. Binding to the PTH receptor on osteoblasts
            2. Osteoblast expresses RANK ligand (RANKL)
            3. RANKL interacts with RANK, a membrane receptor of osteoclasts, and activates them.
        - Increase in calcitriol biosynthesis

> [!NOTE] Hyperparathyroidism
> There can be primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism, resulting in hypercalcemia, occurs due to an autonomous adenoma that leads to overactivity of the parathyroid glands and consequently an increased level of parathyroid hormone. In secondary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hormone is produced in greater amounts in response to a chronically low calcium level. The rarer tertiary variant describes hypercalcemia occurring in long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism due to inadequately high parathyroid hormone release. When hyperparathyroidism is accompanied by an elevated calcium level, a typical symptomatology of kidney stones, bone pain, and stomach ulcers occurs ("stone, bone, and stomach pain").

> [!NOTE] Hypoparathyroidism
> A subfunction of the parathyroid gland can arise, for example, if the epithelial bodies were accidentally removed during a thyroid operation. The consequence is hypocalcemia (i.e., the calcium in the blood is decreased) with possible muscle twitches, cramps, and tetany.

## Review Questions on the Chapter on Parathyroid Glands
### Function: Calcium and Phosphate Balance

What function do the parathyroid glands serve?
- The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and thereby play an important role in the calcium and phosphate metabolism.

How does parathyroid hormone affect calcium and phosphate levels?
- Parathyroid hormone increases the calcium level and decreases the phosphate level.

What are the three target organs of parathyroid hormone and how does it act on them?
- The three target organs of parathyroid hormone are bone, kidney, and intestine. In the bone, parathyroid hormone activates osteoclasts, which releases calcium and phosphate from the bone. In the kidney, parathyroid hormone induces increased reabsorption of calcium, while phosphate reabsorption is inhibited and phosphate as well as bicarbonate excretion is promoted. Moreover, parathyroid hormone stimulates the synthesis of calcitriol (vitamin D hormone) in the kidney. This occurs by increasing the activity of 1α-hydroxylase, an enzyme expressed in the renal tubules which catalyzes the conversion of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. Since calcitriol raises calcium levels, among other things, through increased enteral absorption, parathyroid hormone thus also has an (indirect) effect on the intestine.

How is the secretion of parathyroid hormone regulated?
- Parathyroid hormone secretion is regulated depending on the calcium level. At a low calcium level, such as with vitamin D deficiency, parathyroid hormone secretion increases to compensate for hypocalcemia. Conversely, with a high calcium level, parathyroid hormone secretion decreases.

Which hormone, also referred to as the antagonist of parathyroid hormone, causes a decrease in osteoclast activity?
- Calcitonin, synthesized in the thyroid gland, causes a reduction in the calcium level through various mechanisms (including by decreasing osteoclast activity), thus having an effect opposite to parathyroid hormone. However, on phosphate levels, both hormones act similarly – under the influence of calcitonin, enhanced phosphate excretion through the kidney leads to a decrease in phosphate level.

What is meant by primary hyperparathyroidism and what symptoms occur?
- Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an overfunction of the parathyroid glands (e.g., due to an adenoma of the parathyroid glands) resulting in elevated parathyroid hormone levels. The typical symptoms mainly affect the kidney, the bones, and the gastrointestinal tract. The resulting hypercalcemia can cause, among other things, kidney stones and gastric ulcers. Activation of osteoclasts leads to breakdown of bone substance, which can be accompanied by bone pain ("stone, bone, and stomach pain").
