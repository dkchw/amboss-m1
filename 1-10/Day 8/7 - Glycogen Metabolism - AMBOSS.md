# Glycogen Metabolism
## Summary

Glycogen is a highly branched polymer made of glucose molecules; it serves as the primary storage carbohydrate of the human organism. Although glycogen is found in all cells (except for erythrocytes), the largest glycogen stores are located in the liver and skeletal muscle. The glycogen stores in skeletal muscle are used for the muscle's own supply, while the liver is primarily responsible for maintaining blood sugar levels. Full glycogen stores can provide the organism with energy for about 12–48 hours without food intake. The synthesis and breakdown of glycogen are subject to strict regulation, mainly mediated by the hormones insulin, glucagon, and adrenaline.

## General

- Definition/Meaning: Glycogen is the most important storage carbohydrate in the human organism.
- Occurrence (Glycogen storage): In the cytoplasm (more precisely: cytosol) of all cells, except for erythrocytes (the largest storage is in skeletal muscle, followed by the liver)
- Structure: Highly branched polymer made of glucose molecules that are linked together by α-1,4-glycosidic and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds.

> [!NOTE]
> The glycogen stores in skeletal muscle serve self-supply, while the liver is primarily responsible for maintaining blood sugar levels!

## Glycogen Synthesis

1. Activation of glucose to Uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose)
    - Glucose-Phosphate Mutase: Isomerizes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate
    - Glucose-1-phosphate UTP-Transferase: Synthesis of UDP-Glucose from Glucose-1-phosphate and Uridine triphosphate with the release of Pyrophosphate
2. Extension of unbranched chains
    - Glycogen synthase: α-1,4-glycosidic linkage of UDP-glucose with the hydroxyl group at the free C4-end of the glycogen chain with the release of UDP
3. Inserting branching points
    - Branching Enzyme: Cleaves α-1,4-glycosidic bonds of the unbranched chain and transfers a small chain of 6-7 glucose units to the C6 atom of another glucose molecule in the glycogen chain.
4. Formation of a glycogen molecule
    - Glycogenin: Cytosolic protein made up of two identical subunits that serves as a starter glycogen and possesses glycosyltransferase activity.
        - The first step of glycogen synthesis is the autoglycosylation of glycogenin: Each of the two subunits of the protein catalyzes the attachment of a chain of eight glucose units to a tyrosyl residue of the other subunit.
        - Substrate: UDP-Glucose (activated glucose)
        - When the oligosaccharide chain is eight molecules long, glycogen synthase begins its work and extends the glycogen molecule.

> [!NOTE]
> Glycogenin is not cleaved – it is present inside every glycogen molecule!

> [!NOTE]
> Process of glycogen synthesis starting from glucose: Glc → Glc-6-P → Glc-1-P → UDP-Glc → glycogen

## Glycogen Breakdown

- Cleavage of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds
    - Glycogen phosphorylase (Coenzyme: Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP))
        - Splits terminal glucose molecules by the addition of an inorganic phosphate group.
        - Product: Glucose-1-phosphate
        - Cleavage stops four glucose monomers before a branching point.
- Cleavage of α-1,6-glycosidic bonds: Two-step degradation using the debranching enzyme
    - 1. Enzyme activity: α-1,4-α-1,4-Glucantransferase
        - Transfers a trisaccharide unit from the branch comprising four glucose monomers to another chain in glycogen.
    - 2. Enzyme activity: Amylo-α-1,6-Glucosidase
        - Hydrolytic cleavage of the α-1,6-glycosidic bond at the exposed branching point.
        - Product: Free Glucose

> [!NOTE]
> The glycogenolysis occurs largely not hydrolytically, but phosphorolytically. The product is not free glucose, but glucose-1-phosphate. Only at the branching points does a hydrolytic cleavage occur, where free glucose is then produced!

> [!NOTE] Glycogenoses
> In cases of disturbances in glycogen breakdown, there is an accumulation of normally or pathologically structured glycogen in the cells. These glycogen storage diseases are referred to as glycogenoses. There are 7 different types known, which differ in their causes. Primarily affected are muscles and the liver, which contain the largest glycogen stores.

### Regulation of Glycogen Metabolism

The glycogen metabolism is primarily regulated hormonally. It is based on the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Since glycogen has different functions in the liver and skeletal muscle, its metabolism is also regulated independently in both organ systems. For example, in skeletal muscle, there is allosteric regulation by ATP, AMP, glucose-6-phosphate, and calcium ions, whereas in the liver, it is regulated by glucose.

- Principle
    - cAMP↑ → Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) → Phosphorylation of various enzymes → Activation of glycogen phosphorylase and deactivation of glycogen synthase → Increased glycogen breakdown and decreased glycogen synthesis
    - cAMP↓ → Activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) → Dephosphorylation of various enzymes → Deactivation of glycogen phosphorylase and activation of glycogen synthase → Decrease in glycogen breakdown and increase in glycogen synthesis

### Hormonal Regulation

- Involved hormones
    - Glucagon and adrenaline: Bind to G-protein coupled receptors that are coupled with adenylate cyclase → cAMP↑ → glycogen synthesis↓ and glycogen breakdown↑
    - Insulin: Lowers the cAMP level in the cell → Glycogen synthesis↑ and glycogen breakdown↓
- Process
    - Glycogen↓ through cAMP↑
        - Activation of protein kinase A (PKA)
        - PKA now phosphorylates glycogen synthase, phosphorylase kinase, and protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor while consuming ATP.
            - Phosphorylated glycogen synthase is inactive
            - Phosphorylated phosphorylase kinase is itself an active protein kinase that now phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase.
                - Phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase is active
            - The phosphorylated protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor binds to and inactivates protein phosphatase 1, which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase, phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase.
    - Glycogen↑ through cAMP↓
        - Inactivation of protein kinase A (PKA) → Glycogen synthesis↑ and glycogen breakdown↓
        - Activation of Protein Kinase B (PKB) → PKB phosphorylates and inactivates Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) → Glycogen synthase remains dephosphorylated and thus active → Glycogen synthesis↑
        - Activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)
        - PP1 dephosphorylates glycogen synthase, phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase.
            - Dephosphorylated glycogen synthase is active
            - Dephosphorylated phosphorylase kinase is inactive → No phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase
            - Dephosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase is inactive.

> [!NOTE]
> The effector cAMP stimulates glycogen breakdown and prevents glycogen synthesis!

> [!NOTE]
> The increased presence of phosphate in the cells is a hunger signal: All enzymes that raise blood sugar levels are active in their phosphorylated form!

### Allosteric Regulation

The allosteric regulation of the enzymes directly involved in glycogen metabolism, as well as their regulatory kinases and phosphatases, differs between skeletal muscle and liver. Important allosteric regulatory mechanisms in skeletal muscle are listed as examples here.

- Activation of glycogen phosphorylase (glycogen breakdown↑)
    - AMP
    - Indirectly through calcium ions: Ca2+ binds to the calmodulin subunits of phosphorylase kinase and activates them independently of phosphorylation.
- Deactivation of glycogen phosphorylase (glycogen breakdown↓)
    - Glucose-6-Phosphate
    - ATP

## Review Questions on the Chapter Glycogen Metabolism
### General

Where is glycogen stored in the cells?
- Glycogen is stored in the cytoplasm (more precisely: cytosol) of the cells.

How is glycogen structured?
- Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose molecules that are connected by α-1,4-glycosidic and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds.

### Glycogen Synthesis

Through which intermediate stages is glucose converted to ultimately be incorporated into a glycogen molecule?
- The sequence of intermediates in glycogen synthesis starting from glucose is: glucose → glucose-6-phosphate → glucose-1-phosphate → UDP-glucose → glycogen.

What type of reaction is involved in the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate?
- The conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose-1-phosphate is an isomerization reaction – the molecular formula stays the same, only the structure changes.

How is UDP-glucose produced for glycogen synthesis?
- UDP-glucose is formed during glycogen synthesis from glucose-1-phosphate and uridine triphosphate with the release of pyrophosphate. The reaction is catalyzed by glucose-1-phosphate-UTP transferase.

What is the function of glycogen synthase and what prerequisite does it need in order to work?
- Glycogen synthase links the OH group at the free C4 end of a glycogen chain with UDP-glucose, forming an α-1,4-glycosidic bond. Glycogen synthase can only add glucose residues to already existing glycogen molecules.

Which protein is required for the formation of glycogen and what is its function?
- If glycogen has to be newly formed (e.g. after prolonged fasting), the protein glycogenin is required as a "starter molecule." It has glycosyltransferase activity and can glycosylate itself using UDP-glucose on a tyrosyl residue. Only when the oligosaccharide chain consists of eight glucose residues does glycogen synthase take over.

Which molecule serves as the substrate for glycosyltransferases?
- UDP-glucose serves as the substrate for glycosyltransferases.
### Glycogen Breakdown

With which reaction does glycogen breakdown typically begin at the terminal (non-reducing) end of the glycogen molecule?
- Glycogen breakdown usually begins with the cleavage of the α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. The responsible enzyme is glycogen phosphorylase – it cleaves the terminal glucose molecules by attaching an inorganic phosphate group (so-called phosphorolysis).
### Regulation of Glycogen Metabolism

What effect does the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase have and which hormones stimulate the phosphorylation?
- Glycogen phosphorylase is activated by phosphorylation. This phosphorylation is stimulated by adrenaline and glucagon.

Which enzyme phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase and how is it activated?
- Glycogen phosphorylase is phosphorylated (and thereby activated) by phosphorylase kinase. However, phosphorylase kinase must first be phosphorylated itself by PKA.

What does the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase do?
- Glycogen synthase is inactivated by phosphorylation, which leads to decreased glycogen synthesis.

Through which three mechanisms is glycogen synthesis increased with reduced cAMP levels?
- A low cAMP level leads to increased glycogen synthesis and reduced breakdown by inactivating protein kinase A (PKA). On the other hand, protein kinase B (PKB) is activated. PKB phosphorylates (inactivates) glycogen synthase kinase 3, so glycogen synthase remains dephosphorylated (activated). The third mechanism occurs via activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1): This dephosphorylates glycogen synthase (activated), phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase (both inactivated).
