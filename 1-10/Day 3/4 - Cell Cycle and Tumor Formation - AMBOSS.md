# Cell Cycle and Tumor Formation
## Summary

The cell cycle consists of a periodic sequence of events between two cell divisions. It regulates and coordinates cell reproduction and is composed of two phases: the interphase and the M-phase. During the interphase, the cell prepares for division, while in the M-phase, the division of the cell nucleus (mitosis) and the cell (cytokinesis) occurs. From one mother cell, two identical daughter cells are formed.

## Cell Cycle

- Definition: Periodic sequence of events from the end of one cell division to the end of the next.
- Division: Can be divided into two sections: Interphase and Mitosis
    - Interphase: The cell prepares for division.
        - Their duration is very variable.
        - Resting phase (G0 phase): Cells that do not continue to divide, but differentiate, enter the G0 stage and no longer proceed through the cell cycle.
    - Mitosis (Duration: approx. 1 h)
        - Definition: Process of cell division (from the division of genetic material to the pinching off of the cell body), in which two identical daughter cells are formed.
        - Mitosis index: Indicates the number of mitoses within a cell population (e.g., per 1000 cells or per testing area in the specimen)

### Interphase

- G1-Phase (Duration: Hours to Months): Synthesis of proteins and cell organelles
    - For each chromosome, there is one chromatid present.
    - G0-Phase
        - In the G1 phase, it often occurs after the synthesis of all components that there is a "terminal differentiation": The cell does not continue through the cell cycle but enters a resting phase.
- S-Phase (Duration: approx. 8 h)
    - DNA replication (there are two sister chromatids present per chromosome)
    - Synthesis of proteins required for the packaging of DNA (especially histone proteins)
- G2 phase (Duration: approx. 2–5 h): Repair of replication errors

> [!note]
> Most cells in a mature tissue are not in the cell cycle but in a resting state (G0 phase). They are differentiated and each fulfills specific functions. Mitoses are rarely found in mature tissue!

> [!note] Deducing the differentiation of malignant tumors
> Malignant tumors are defined, among other things, by the fact that tumor cells dedifferentiate, meaning they revert to less differentiated cells with a high mitotic rate. If a pathologist sees many "mitotic figures" in a tissue section under the microscope, this can be an indication of a malignant process.

### Mitosis

- Prophase
    - Chromosome condensation
    - Separation of the centrosomes
        - Centrosome
            - Starting point of the spindle apparatus
            - Consists of two centrioles and surrounding matrix, from which additional microtubules can originate.
    - Formation of the mitotic spindle
- Prometaphase
    - Disintegration of the nuclear membrane into small vesicles and intracellular storage of the vesicles
    - Completion of the mitotic spindle
- Metaphase
    - Chromosomes maximally condensed are located in the equatorial plane.
- Anaphase
    - Separation of sister chromatids due to the dissolution of the last bond at the centromere by the enzyme separase
    - Cell takes on an elongated appearance.
        - Kinetochore microtubules shorten (through depolymerization) → Sister chromatids are pulled apart.
        - Polar microtubules elongate (through polymerization) → Polar microtubules exert pushing force on the poles → Cell becomes elongated
- Telophase
    - Decondensation of the chromosomes
    - Spindle apparatus dissolves
    - A new core membrane is formed.
    - Cleavage of the cell body by an actin- and myosin-rich contractile ring
    - Cell body divides in the equatorial plane
    - Start of rRNA synthesis

> [!note] Spider venoms
> The flawless function of the spindle apparatus is a prerequisite for chromosome transport. If these processes are inhibited by so-called spindle poisons, mitosis is arrested at this point; cell division cannot be completed. This can be clinically utilized in the treatment of tumors, which usually exhibit a high mitotic rate. The tissues particularly affected by side effects are those that physiologically have a high proliferation rate, such as bone marrow. Famous representatives of spindle poisons include colchicine, which inhibits the polymerization of microtubules, as well as vinca alkaloids and taxanes.

## Regulation of the Cell Cycle

### Fundamental Principle of Cell Cycle Regulation

- In the G1 phase, it often occurs after the synthesis of all components that a "terminal differentiation" takes place.
- Certain growth factors, however, stimulate the cell to enter the S phase.
    - Once this is initiated, the cell cycle must be completed through the next mitosis.
- At various points in the cell cycle, there are defined control and transition points.
    - In the event of an error in the DNA, the cell cycle can be stopped at this point to make repairs. If this is unsuccessful, apoptosis is initiated.
- At the control and transition points sit the so-called cyclin-dependent protein kinases (Cdks), which are activated by cyclins.
    - Definition: Cdks phosphorylate specific signaling proteins that initiate the transition from one phase of the cell cycle to the next.
    - Activation: Through cyclins and subsequently further regulation by reversible phosphorylation
    - Inhibition
        - Cdks can be inhibited by so-called inhibitor proteins (Cdk inhibitors) when errors in the genetic material are detected → Inhibitor proteins are also referred to as tumor suppressors because their role is to prevent uncontrolled growth of cells with defective genetic material.

### Important Control and Transition Points

The p53 protein prevents cells with genetic errors from entering the S phase of the cell cycle. It is therefore classified as a tumor suppressor!

- G1-S transition (G1 checkpoint): Is regulated by the Cdk4/Cyclin D complex as well as the p53 protein.
    - Goal: Control of the cell for correct nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, sufficient nutrient content, and DNA damage
        - Cdk4/Cyclin-D complex
            1. Cdk4/Cyclin-D complex phosphorylates the protein pRb (Retinoblastoma protein)
            2. pRb releases the previously bound transcription factor E2F
            3. E2F initiates the transcription of many genes that are necessary for DNA replication.
        - Tumor suppressor protein p53
            - Coding gene: TP53
            - Function: "Guardian of the Genome"
                - Can prevent entry into the S-phase if DNA damage is present (so-called tumor suppressor)
                - If the damage is not repaired, p53 initiates apoptosis.
            - Mechanism of action
                - p53 is present in every cell, but it is continuously ubiquitinated and degraded.
                - DNA damage leads to the activation of various protein kinases; these phosphorylate p53
                - Phosphorylated p53 can no longer be ubiquitinated and degraded; it acts as a transcription factor and stimulates the expression of various genes, e.g.
                    - Cdk inhibitor p21 (inhibits entry into the S phase by blocking the phosphorylation of pRb)
                    - Pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bad
- G2-M transition (G2 checkpoint): Is regulated by the Mitosis Promoting Factor (MPF)
    - This initiates mitosis through the phosphorylation of various proteins (e.g., histones)
    - MPF consists of Cdk1 and Cyclin B
    - Activation of MPF among others by the cleavage of inhibitory phosphate residues from Cdk1
    - Goal: Control of correct DNA replication
- Metaphase checkpoint (M checkpoint): Between metaphase and anaphase
    - Goal: Control of the correct alignment of chromosomes in the equatorial plane, so that the separation of sister chromatids can occur.

> [!note] Human Papillomavirus
> Infections with human papillomaviruses are sexually transmitted diseases responsible for genital warts and carcinomas of the anal and genital regions as well as of the mouth, throat, and larynx. A viral oncogene is responsible for the carcinogenicity of the virus, which stimulates the ubiquitination and thus the degradation of p53. As a result, one of the most important tumor suppressor proteins in the cell is inactivated.

> [!note] Development of retinoblastoma
> In a mutation in the gene of the retinoblastoma protein, there are misregulations of the cell cycle, leading to unchecked growth of tumor cells in the retina, known as retinoblastoma. It is not yet clear why a tumor specifically occurs in the eye when pRb no longer functions correctly - after all, it is important for the regulation of the cell cycle in all body cells.

## Tumor Development (Carcinogenesis)

- Definition: Carcinogenesis describes the emergence of malignant tumors.
- Multi-step hypothesis
    1. Initiation: Damage to DNA
    2. Promotion: The defect is passed on
    3. Latency: Time between promotion and progression
    4. Progression: The neoplastic cell line proliferates with the acquired DNA damage, leading to malignant transformation.

### DNA Damage

- Changes in DNA
    - Mutation
        - Types of mutations
            - Duplication mutation: One or more bases are duplicated.
            - Insertionsmutation: One or more bases are additionally inserted.
            - Deletionsmutation: One or more bases are lost
            - Point mutation: One base is exchanged for another.
        - Follow
            - Silent Mutation: Altered codon that codes for the same amino acid (especially possible in point mutations)
            - Nonsense mutation: Formation of a stop codon that can lead to altered splicing processes and premature translation termination.
            - Missense mutation: Altered codon encoding a different amino acid
            - Somatic Mutation: Does not occur in the germline and therefore only affects one allele.
    - Translocation: Gene move to another chromosome
        - Example: Translocation t(9;22) in CML
            - A longer chromosome 9 (9q+) and a shortened chromosome 22, also known as the Philadelphia chromosome (22q‑), is created.
    - Amplification: Multiple gene expression
        - Example: The HER2 gene is overexpressed in some forms of breast cancer.

### Key Genes of Carcinogenesis

- (Proto-)oncogene
    - Proto-oncogenes encode proteins that are important for physiological cell division and differentiation.
    - Irreversible damage to proto-oncogenes → formation of oncogenes
        - Lead to a constant proliferation stimulus and tumor growth due to the lack of inactivation of various signaling proteins and growth factors, as well as the overexpression of growth factors.
    - Examples of gene products from proto-oncogenes
        - Growth factors and cytokines
        - Tyrosine kinase receptors
        - GTP-binding Proteins
            1. Receptor-coupled G-proteins
            2. Small G-proteins, such as Ras (the oncogene of Ras is called C-Ras)
        - Ligand-controlled transcription factors (intracellular hormone receptors)
        - Tumor suppressors
        - Protein kinases, e.g. protein kinase B (PKB, AKT)
            - PI3K/AKT signaling pathway: PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase) phosphorylates PIP2 (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) to PIP3 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) → PIP3 activates PKB → PKB activates and inhibits various substrates and thus inhibits apoptosis, activates translation, and indirectly promotes cell division.
- Tumor suppressor gene
    - "Anti"-oncogenes that regulate physiological cell growth
        - Inhibit the proliferation
        - E.g. generation of the retinoblastoma protein
            - Retinoblastoma Protein (Rb-Protein): Binds E2F transcription factors and thereby inhibits the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase.
    - Often named after the location of the first researched malfunction
        - For example, p53 gene
- Apoptosis-regulating genes
    - Loss of regulatory genes (e.g., Bax) leads to immortality of the cell and increased proliferation.
    - There is no physiological elimination through apoptosis, so the risk of malignant cell transformation increases.
- Factors that influence the key genes of carcinogenesis
    - Risk exposure
    - Geographical Location
    - Nutrition

> [!note] Familial adenomatous polyposis coli
> In familial adenomatous polyposis coli, which leads to a 100% lifetime risk of colorectal carcinoma, there is a mutation of the tumor suppressor gene APC (acronym for "adenomatous polyposis coli" in English). Normally, the APC protein binds, among other things, the cell adhesion molecule β-Catenin, leading to its degradation. However, through the so-called Wnt signaling pathway, this degradation can be prevented, resulting in the accumulation of β-Catenin, which triggers the transcription of certain cell cycle-related genes (e.g., c-myc) in the cell nucleus. However, the APC mutation causes β-Catenin to be bound less effectively and promotes transcription independent of the Wnt signaling pathway.

## Apoptosis

### Overview

- Short description: Programmed cell death of the cell
- Characteristics
    - Genetically determined, among other things, certain structures are initially established during embryonic development and later removed (e.g., the interdigital webs)
    - Usually affects individual cells and not a cell association (in contrast to necrosis)
    - No inflammatory reaction or cell swelling (unlike necrosis)
- Signaling Cascade: Apoptosis can be initiated through two pathways, the extrinsic pathway (through extracellular stimuli) and the intrinsic pathway (through intracellular stimuli).
    - General process: Intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli lead through initiator and effector caspases to the apoptotic decay process of the cell.
        1. Intrinsic or extrinsic factors activate initiator caspases.
        2. Initiator caspases activate effector caspases
        3. Effector caspases initiate apoptosis.
    - Caspases: Enzymes of the group "Cysteine-Aspartate-specific Proteases" that hydrolytically cleave proteins and peptides, ultimately attacking cell membranes, cell nuclei, and cytoplasm.

### Extrinsic Pathway of Apoptosis

- Principle: Extracellular factors activate the initiator caspases.
    - Receptor-ligand complex: Extracellular ligands (e.g., TNF-α, TRAIL, or Fas ligands) bind to the "death receptor" on the cell surface (the so-called death receptors, such as the Fas receptor and the TNF receptor, belong to the TNF superfamily)
        1. Death receptor is activated by ligand binding.
        2. Receptor-ligand complex activates initiator caspases (particularly initiator caspase 8)
    - Perforin/Granzyme B Pathway: Natural killer cells or cytotoxic T cells release perforin and granzyme B.
        1. Natural killer cell or cytotoxic T cell recognizes target cell and releases perforin and granzyme B.
        2. Perforin enables the entry of Granzyme B into the target cell.
        3. Granzym B activates initiator caspases (especially initiator caspase 10)

### Intrinsic/Mitochondrial Pathway of Apoptosis

- Principle: Intracellular pro-apoptotic proteins activate the initiator caspases.
    1. Increase in pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bak, or Bad)
    2. The pro-apoptotic proteins increase the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane, for example, through the channel formation of the heterodimer Bax/Bak through the membrane.
    3. Cytochrome c enters the cytosol from the mitochondrion through the membrane.
    4. In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to APAF-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor-1)
    5. The complex of cytochrome c and APAF-1 binds to procaspase 9, thereby forming the active form of caspase 9 (initiator caspase 9).
- Increase of pro-apoptotic proteins in the cytosol through
    - DNA damage
        1. DNA-damaging stimuli (e.g., chemical toxins, radiation) activate the protein p53.
        2. p53 leads to an intracellular increase in pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bax, Bak, or Bad from the Bcl-2 family)
    - Absence of signal at the survival receptor
        1. No binding of a regulating survival factor (such as IL-2) to the survival receptor.
        2. Inhibition of the apoptotic signaling cascade by the survival receptor is lifted.

### Connection and Shared Path

- Connection: Caspase 8 is not only part of the extrinsic pathway, but it also stimulates the intrinsic pathway by altering the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
- Common pathway: All initiator caspases activate the effector caspases (caspases 3, 6, and 7)

### Effects of Apoptosis

- Shrinkage of the cell nucleus due to condensation of the chromatin
- Cell communication (including via gap junctions) remains intact in the early stages of apoptosis.
    - This allows apoptosis signals to be transmitted from one cell to another.
    - Ca2+ can prevent transmission by closing the gap junctions.
- The cell detaches from its connections with other cells or the extracellular matrix.
- Fragmentation of the cell nucleus
- Disintegration of the cell into apoptotic particles (so-called blebbing)
- Phagocytosis by macrophages and non-professional phagocytes such as epithelial cells

> [!note]
> The proteins of the Bcl-2 family can have opposing effects; for example, Bad, Bak, and Bax act pro-apoptotically, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL act anti-apoptotically!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Cell Cycle and Tumorigenesis
### Cell Cycle

What is the so-called "mitosis index"?
- The mitosis index indicates the number of mitoses within a defined cell population (e.g., per test area in the specimen).

What intracellular processes occur during the individual phases of interphase? When are the chromosomes duplicated?
- During the G1 phase, the cell organelles and proteins are synthesized. Each chromosome initially has one chromatid because DNA replication and synthesis of histone proteins only take place in the subsequent S phase. At the end of the S phase, therefore, each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. This is followed by the G2 phase, in which any replication errors are repaired before mitosis begins. However, most cells of mature tissues are in the G0 phase, a resting state that can follow the G1 phase. During the G0 phase, cells no longer go through the cell cycle, are differentiated, and fulfill their specific function in the tissue.

In what sections is mitosis divided? Describe what happens in each phase!
- Mitosis begins with prophase, during which the chromosomes condense. The centrosomes separate and form the mitotic spindle at opposite poles. The spindle apparatus itself consists of microtubules and is completed during prometaphase. During prometaphase, the nuclear membrane also breaks down. This is followed by metaphase, during which the maximally condensed chromosomes align at the equatorial plane. During anaphase, the sister chromatids are separated. For this, their last connection at the centromere is cleaved by separase. At the same time, the cell acquires an elongated shape due to a length change in the microtubules. During telophase, the chromosomes decondense. The spindle apparatus disassembles and new nuclear membranes form. The cell body divides at the equatorial plane and rRNA synthesis begins.

How do spindle poisons work? Name an exemplary example of a spindle poison!
- Spindle poisons inhibit the transport of chromosomes along the spindle apparatus. This arrests mitosis at this point and cell division cannot be completed. Famous representatives of spindle poisons are colchicine and vinca alkaloids (which inhibit microtubule polymerization) as well as taxanes (which stabilize microtubules).

### Regulation of the Cell Cycle

Through which central enzymes is the transition of a cell from one phase of the cell cycle to the next regulated? How are these regulated?
- In the cell cycle, there are several defined checkpoints and transition points regulated by so-called "cyclin-dependent protein kinases" (Cdks). These are only activated by binding to cyclins and then phosphorylate specific signaling proteins that initiate the transition to the next phase of the cell cycle. If errors in the genetic material are detected, the Cdks can be inhibited by so-called "inhibitor proteins" (Cdk inhibitors). These inhibitor proteins belong to the tumor suppressors.

Describe the mechanism of action of p53!
- The p53 protein belongs to the tumor suppressors and is also called the guardian of the genome. It prevents cells with DNA damage from entering the S phase of the cell cycle. The DNA damage leads to activation of various protein kinases. These phosphorylate p53 so that it can no longer be degraded. Thus, it unfolds its function as a transcription factor and stimulates the expression of various genes, including the Cdk inhibitor p21.

What is meant by the M control point?
- The metaphase checkpoint lies between metaphase and anaphase of mitosis. At this checkpoint, the correct alignment of chromosomes at the equatorial plane is checked before the separation of sister chromatids can take place.

### Tumor Development (Carcinogenesis)

What is referred to as a missense mutation?
- A missense mutation arises from DNA damage that produces an altered codon (triplet of bases), which codes for an amino acid different from the original one.

What genetic mutation is commonly present in CML (chronic myeloid leukemia)?
- In over 90% of patients with CML (chronic myeloid leukemia), there is a translocation t(9;22). This results in an elongated chromosome 9 (9q+) and a shortened chromosome 22 (22q-). The latter is called the Philadelphia chromosome. In fact, numerous malignancies can be associated with a Philadelphia translocation, but it is especially typical for CML.

In which two groups can the key genes of carcinogenesis be classified?
- In carcinogenesis, two groups of genes play a central role: On the one hand, proto-oncogenes, which encode proteins important for cell division and differentiation. Certain mutations in proto-oncogenes lead to the formation of oncogenes. Their counterparts are tumor suppressor genes, which regulate physiological cell growth and inhibit excessive proliferation. Loss of function of these genes promotes tumor formation.

What effect does protein kinase B (PKB) have on tumor formation and how is it regulated?
- Protein kinase B (PKB) belongs to the proto-oncogenes. It activates and inhibits various substrates through phosphorylation, for example, it inhibits apoptosis, activates translation, and thus indirectly promotes cell division. PKB itself is activated by PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase).

How does the retinoblastoma protein function as a tumor suppressor gene?
- The retinoblastoma protein (Rb protein) binds E2F transcription factors and thereby inhibits the transition from the G1 to the S phase.

### Apoptosis

How does the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis proceed?
- The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis begins with extracellular ligands (e.g., TNF-α, TRAIL, or Fas ligands) binding to the "death receptor" on the cell surface and thereby activating it. The receptor-ligand complex then activates initiator caspases, e.g., caspase 8. Caspase 8, in turn, activates effector caspases, e.g., caspase 3. Caspases cleave proteins and peptides and thus attack cell membranes, nuclei, and cytoplasm, ultimately causing the cell to break down into apoptotic particles that are phagocytosed by macrophages.

How does the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis proceed?
- The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is activated by intracellular ligands. DNA damage, for example caused by chemical noxae or radiation, leads to activation of p53, which as a transcription factor increases the expression of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax, Bad). These proteins increase the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane, allowing cytochrome c to pass from the mitochondrion into the cytosol and bind there to APAF-1 (apoptotic protease activating factor 1). The complex of cytochrome c and APAF-1 converts procaspase 9 into active caspase 9, which activates effector caspases such as caspase 3. Caspases cleave proteins and peptides and thus attack cell membranes, nuclei, and cytoplasm, ultimately leading the cell to disintegrate into apoptotic particles that are phagocytosed by macrophages.
