# Spleen
## Summary

The spleen (Splen, Lien) is an organ located intraperitoneally in the upper left abdomen. Histologically, it can be divided into red and white pulp, in which different organ functions take place. During the embryonic phase, the spleen is temporarily involved in blood formation. Postnatally, however, only the sorting of old erythrocytes and thrombocytes occurs here – the so-called blood cell shedding. The blood is supplied to the network ("reticulum") of pulp strands in the red pulp for this purpose. The network can only be traversed by young, well-deformable erythrocytes and thrombocytes.

As a secondary lymphatic organ, the spleen also has an immunological function. The lymphatic tissue is located in the white pulp. This is visited by some lymphocytes after maturation in the primary lymphatic organs in anticipation of their activation. Clinically, the examination of the spleen is particularly important after trauma or in hematological-oncological diseases.

### Profile

- Function
    - Immunological monitoring of the blood
    - Breakdown of old erythrocytes
    - Embryonal phase: Blood formation
- Location: Intraperitoneal in the left upper abdomen

### Structure and Topography

The coffee bean-shaped spleen is located in the upper left abdomen in the so-called splenic niche. With a size of 4 cm x 7 cm x 11 cm, it lies with its longitudinal axis parallel to the 10th rib; however, there is a pronounced mobility depending on breathing and the filling state of the neighboring organs. 10-20% of all people have one or even several smaller accessory spleens, which are usually located near the main spleen.

> [!NOTE]
> "Kölnisch-Wasser" or "4711" rule: Thickness (4 cm) x Width (7 cm) x Length (11 cm) of the spleen!

> [!NOTE] Splenomegaly
> Due to its location beneath the rib cage, the spleen is not palpable during a physical examination in normal configuration. Splenomegaly can occur, for example, in the context of hematological diseases such as certain forms of leukemia when the spleen resumes its blood-forming function or increases the breakdown of blood cells. A spleen enlargement is also not uncommon in liver cirrhosis associated with portal hypertension due to impaired venous blood outflow. In the worst case, massive enlargement can even lead to a splenic rupture resulting in life-threatening intra-abdominal bleeding.

#### Areas of the Spleen

The spleen has various poles, edges, and surfaces that can be used to describe its location or its topographical relationships.

- Pole
    - Anterior extremity: Pole directed forward and downward
    - Posterior extremity: Pole directed upward and backward
- Edges
    - Margo superior: Upper margin
    - Marginal inferior: Lower edge
- Areas
    - Diaphragmatic surface: Convex surface of the spleen that is located directly beneath the diaphragm dome and is oriented toward the ribs.
    - Visceral surface
        - Central to the visceral surface is the entry and exit portal for the vessels and nerves, referred to as the splenic hilum.
        - Due to its position relative to the neighboring organs, the visceralis surface can be further subdivided.
            - Gastric facies: Borders the stomach
            - Colic facies: Borders the left colonic flexure
            - Renal facies: Borders the left kidney

#### Peritoneal Relationships and Ligaments of the Spleen

Aside from the hilum, the spleen is completely intraperitoneal in the so-called splenic niche. This is formed by ligaments (peritoneal duplications) and is bordered posteriorly and laterally by the diaphragm.

- Gastrosplenic ligament (Gastrolienal ligament)
    - Connects the splenic hilum with the greater curvature of the stomach
    - Contains the short gastric arteries (Aa. gastricae breves) as well as the left gastroepiploic artery (A. gastroomentalis sinistra)
- Splenorenal ligament (Lienorenal ligament, Phrenicosplenic ligament)
    - Creates a connection between the spleen, tail of the pancreas, diaphragm, and dorsal abdominal wall
    - Carries the splenic artery and vein with it.
- Phrenicocolic ligament
    - Connects the left colic flexure with the diaphragm
    - Forms the base of the splenic niche
- Splenic recess (Lienal recess) of the omental bursa
    - Lies between the gastro-splenic ligament and the splenorenal ligament at the hilum of the spleen.
    - Forms the lateral boundary of the omental bursa

> [!NOTE]
> Except for the hilum, the spleen is completely intraperitoneal in the splenic niche. The floor of the splenic niche is formed by the lig. phrenicocolicum!

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

In the case of the spleen, due to its monitoring function and its role as an organ of "blood cell maturation," it is a highly vascularized organ that takes up 3-5% of the cardiac output. The innervation of the spleen mainly occurs for the regulation of vascular diameter. Through vasoconstriction, blood can be pushed into the systemic circulation, whereas vasodilation increases blood cell maturation.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. splenica (A. lienalis) from the celiac trunk<br>    - Course: Cranial to the pancreas in the splenorenal ligament to the hilum of the spleen → Usually divides into smaller branches before entering the spleen|
|Venous|- Splenic vein (V. lienalis) into the hepatic portal vein<br>    - Course: Dorsal to the pancreas in the splenorenal ligament → Union with the superior mesenteric vein to form the portal vein|
|Innervation|   |
|Sympathetic|- Nn. splanchnic major and partly minor from Ggll. celiac|
|Parasympathetic|- Vagus nerve|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Splenic lymph nodes in intestinal trunks|

> [!NOTE]
> Due to its close anatomical relationship with the pancreas, the splenic vein is often used as a guiding structure for locating the pancreas in sonography!

## Microscopic Anatomy

The basic structure of the spleen consists, like that of other secondary lymphatic organs, of reticular fibers and fibroblastic reticular cells. The spleen is surrounded by a delicate organ capsule, whose extensions protrude into the parenchyma and incompletely divide it into segments. The parenchyma itself is made up of 75% red pulp, where blood cell maturation occurs. The white pulp represents the lymphatic tissue. By the way, you'll find a learning video on microscopic anatomy at the end of this section ("Histo-Trainer Spleen").

### Red Pulp

The red splenic pulp consists of pulp strands and the intervening venous sinusoids. This area is where blood cell recycling (breakdown of old erythrocytes and platelets) occurs.

- Red pulp: Makes up 75% of the parenchyma.
    - Pulp strands
        - Wide-meshed network of reticular cells and reticular fibers with interspersed plasma cells and macrophages
        - Some capillaries open here (see below).
    - Sine wave
        - Widespread blood vessels with incomplete basement membrane and discontinuous endothelium
        - The endothelium has wide slits that are held back by ring fibers.

#### Blood flow through the red pulp

In order for erythrocyte maturation to occur, a special vessel system in the spleen is necessary. In addition to the open circulation, through which the sorting of old erythrocytes takes place, there is also a closed system that allows blood to be directly directed to the venous outflow.

- Arterial pathway: Splenic artery → Trabecular/ or beam arteries (running in the splenic trabeculae) → Central artery (after leaving the splenic trabeculae) → Brush arterioles (after they are no longer surrounded by the PALS) → Capillaries and sheathed capillaries (capillaries with Schweigger-Seidel sheath)
    - Open circulation: Free opening of the capillary into the reticular network of the pulp strands → primarily young, well-deformable erythrocytes can pass through the slits in the discontinuous endothelium into the sinusoids → recognition and phagocytosis of old erythrocytes by macrophages
    - Closed circuit: Direct outlet into venous sinusoids
- Venous circulation: Venous sinusoids → Pulp veins → Trabecular veins → Splenic vein

### White Pulp

The white pulp of the spleen makes up 25% of the splenic parenchyma. It represents the lymphatic tissue of the spleen. After maturing in the primary lymphatic organs, lymphocytes migrate into the spleen (as a secondary lymphatic organ) and await their activation. After differentiating into effector cells, the activated B and T lymphocytes return to the bloodstream via the red pulp and can thus reach inflamed tissue.

- White pulp: Makes up 25% of the parenchyma.
    - Periarterial lymphocyte sheath (PALS): Thin cuff (mainly T-lymphocytes) that lies along a central artery.
    - Lymph follicle: Main component of the white pulp
        - Are closely connected to the PALS
        - Part of the B zone (mainly B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells)
        - Depending on antigen exposure, the lymph follicles exhibit a germinal center and a mantle zone.
    - Marginal zone: Lies around the follicles and mainly contains B- lymphocytes, but also T- lymphocytes.
    - Perifollicular Zone
        - Histological component of the red pulp, but functionally relevant for the white pulp
        - Through the open-ended arterioles, lymphocytes pass from the bloodstream into the tissue and migrate into the white pulp.
## Function

The spleen essentially has two tasks that take place in different compartments.

- Function as a secondary lymphatic organ (white pulp): As the largest lymphatic organ, the spleen acts as a filtration station for the blood for immunological surveillance.
    - Activation of T and B lymphocytes (For more details see: Specific Immune System)
- Blood cell recycling (red pulp): Breakdown of old erythrocytes and platelets
- Blood formation: Prenatally, the spleen is one of the organs involved in blood formation.

> [!NOTE] Spleen rupture
> Especially in the context of a blunt abdominal trauma, a rupture of the spleen (splenic rupture) can occur. Since this can lead to massive intra-abdominal bleeding, it must always be treated as an emergency. In addition to the acute splenic rupture, which is usually accompanied by a hemorrhagic shock, the possibility of a delayed rupture must also be considered. Here, a rupture of the capsule with intra-abdominal bleeding can occur days later after a symptom-free interval due to an injury to the splenic parenchyma while the splenic capsule is still intact. Conservative therapy is only feasible in rare cases. In surgical management, efforts are made to preserve the spleen – if possible – either completely or partially.

> [!NOTE] Asplenia
> Asplenia refers to the dysfunction of the spleen. This can occur due to the removal of the spleen (splenectomy) or as functional asplenia in the context of hematological diseases such as sickle cell anemia. For a long time, the possible complications associated with a lack of spleen function were underestimated, as the spleen is not considered a vital organ. Its immunological function can be taken over by other lymphatic organs and the turnover of blood cells can be managed by the liver. Nevertheless, approximately 1-3% of patients may develop severe sepsis (OPSI: Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection) following spleen removal, which is associated with high mortality. Among other mechanisms, the loss of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is particularly immunologically relevant, as encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococci, meningococci, or Haemophilus influenzae are normally phagocytized here. Therefore, vaccination against these pathogens is essential in the context of a splenectomy.

## Development

The development of the spleen begins early; however, its prenatal function is different from that later in the postnatal organism: Prenatally, the spleen is primarily involved in blood formation.

- 5th week: The spleen develops from the mesenchyme and the serosa of the dorsal mesogastrium.
- Shifting of the spleen due to gastric rotation (from the 5th week of development) into the left upper abdomen
    - The portion of the mesogastrium dorsale located dorsal to the spleen becomes the lig. splenorenale and connects the spleen to the dorsal abdominal wall.
    - The part of the dorsal mesogastrium located ventrally to the spleen becomes the gastrosplenic ligament and connects the hilum of the spleen with the greater curvature of the stomach.
- 4th month: Lymphocytic colonization of the spleen
- 6th month: The typical lymph follicles are recognizable.

> [!NOTE]
> Prenatal, the spleen is involved in blood formation! Postnatally, extramedullary blood formation in the spleen would not be physiological, but rather an indication of a hematological-oncological disease (e.g. bone marrow involvement in leukemias or lymphomas)!

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Spleen
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Describe the location of the spleen in the abdominal cavity! What band structures fix it in place?
- The spleen lies intraperitoneally except for the hilus, in the so-called splenic fossa in the left upper abdomen. The floor of the splenic fossa is formed by the ligamentum phrenicocolicum, which stretches between the diaphragm and the left colic flexure. Posteriorly and laterally, it is bounded by the diaphragm. Further fixation of the spleen is provided by the ligaments gastrosplenicum and splenorenale.
Which vessels run in the splenorenal ligament?
- The ligamentum splenorenale contains the splenic artery and vein.
Which ligament of the omentum majus connects the spleen to the stomach and what vessels does it contain?
- The ligamentum gastrosplenicum runs as part of the omentum majus from the splenic hilus to the greater curvature of the stomach. It contains the short gastric arteries and veins and the left gastro-omental artery.
### Microscopic Anatomy

From which vessels do the central arteries of the spleen arise, and what structure surrounds them?
- The central arteries arise from the trabecular arteries running in the splenic trabeculae (which in turn arise from the splenic artery) and are surrounded all around by the periarteriolar lymphoid sheath (PALS).
All secondary lymphatic organs have a similar basic structure. Which areas of the white pulp correspond to the T-zone and which to the B-zone of a lymph node? What structure exists only in the spleen?
- The spleen shows the typical structure of a secondary lymphatic organ with T- and B-zones. The periarteriolar lymphocyte sheath (PALS) forms the T-zone of the spleen; it consists of a thin layer of T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting interdigitating dendritic cells (IDCs) surrounding a central artery. The PALS represents a histological special feature found only in the spleen. The lymph follicles mainly contain B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells and thus belong to the B-zone. They are closely adjacent to the PALS and form the main component of the white pulp.
Through which route do erythrocytes that are not to be degraded in the spleen return to the splenic vein?
- In the spleen, erythrocytes first enter the reticular network of the pulp cords. If the erythrocytes are still young and deformable, they can pass through the slits in the discontinuous endothelium into the venous sinusoids. From there, the blood first flows on via pulp veins, followed by larger trabecular veins, which finally drain into the splenic vein.
### Development

From which embryonic structure does the spleen develop?
- The spleen develops in the 5th embryonic week from the mesenchyme and serosa of the dorsal mesogastrium.
