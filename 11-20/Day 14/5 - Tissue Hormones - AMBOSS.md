# Tissue Hormones
## Summary

In the context of an inflammation, numerous metabolites and inflammatory mediators are released. Particularly, the tissue hormones that are usually secreted in a paracrine manner are predominant here. In addition to the biogenic amine histamine, kinins, eicosanoids, and cytokines play an important regulatory role. Histamine is particularly relevant in allergic reactions and causes bronchoconstriction as well as vasodilation with edema formation. Kinins are released during an inflammatory reaction and facilitate leukocyte migration by increasing vascular permeability and vasodilation. Eicosanoids refer to the arachidonic acid derivatives thromboxane, prostaglandin, and leukotriene, which act as local mediators in inflammation in very different ways. They are produced in various cell types, particularly in immune cells. While the cytokines of the interleukin and interferon families primarily serve immune regulation, the growth factors that also belong to the cytokines play an important role in differentiation and growth processes. For clinical practice, tissue hormones and cytokines are relevant not only in terms of the treatment of inflammation but also for understanding adverse drug reactions. Some of these substances can already be therapeutically used for the treatment of a variety of diseases.
## Overview

Tissue hormones (mediators) are produced by cells in various tissues and are inconsistently categorized in the literature. They are partially classified as aglandular hormones, but are also sometimes listed as a separate hormone group. This is because, unlike most other hormones, they are secreted in a paracrine manner rather than an endocrine manner, and thus primarily exert their effects locally. For this reason, they occupy a special position among hormones. The classification of cytokines as tissue hormones is also disputed, as they are sometimes regarded as independent aglandular hormones. The group of tissue hormones includes, among others, the following signaling substances of different substance classes that are important for the inflammatory response:

- Biogenic Amines: For example, Histamine, Serotonin
- Eicosanoids (Arachidonic acid derivatives): e.g. Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Thromboxane A2
- Polypeptide
    - Kinins: For example, Bradykinin, Kallidin
    - Zytokine
        - Cytokines of the immune system: e.g. interleukins, interferons, chemokines, TNF superfamily
        - Cytokines as growth factors: e.g. general growth factors, hematopoietic growth factors
## Histamine - a biogenic amine

INPUT:
Histamine is the biogenic amine of the amino acid histidine. The synthesis occurs through the conversion of the amino acid histidine with the help of the enzyme histidine decarboxylase and the cofactor PALP (pyridoxal phosphate). Various cells in the body can produce histamine and store it in granules. It affects the stomach, central nervous system, and vascular tone as well as vascular permeability, and plays a clinical role particularly in the context of allergic immediate reactions and in the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers.

> [!NOTE] Gastroduodenal ulcer disease (gastrointestinal ulcers)
> This condition is a tissue defect that exceeds the lamina muscularis mucosae and also affects deeper wall layers. Ulcers occur especially in the mucosa of the stomach or duodenum. They are usually accompanied by epigastric pain but can also remain asymptomatic. In ulcer therapy, H2-receptor blockers were commonly used to reduce gastric acid secretion. Nowadays, however, they are only a second-line treatment, as they have been replaced by more effective proton pump inhibitors in standard therapy. These inhibit the release of gastric acid directly by blocking the H+/K+-ATPase.

> [!NOTE] Allergic immediate reaction and anaphylactic shock
> An allergic reaction of the immediate type is characterized by several steps: First, an allergen triggers the excessive production of IgE antibodies upon initial contact, which can bind to the surface of mast cells via the Fc receptor. These are now sensitized to the allergen. Upon a second contact with the antigen, it binds to the IgE receptors on the mast cell surface, leading to cross-linking of the IgE molecules. This acts as the stimulus for degranulation. The released histamine and other inflammatory mediators cause peripheral vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and airway obstruction. Clinically, this manifests depending on the severity of the allergic reaction as erythema, edema, itching, a drop in blood pressure, and difficulty breathing. In its most severe form, it can lead to circulatory failure. This is referred to as anaphylactic shock, which represents a life-threatening situation. Depending on the severity of the allergic reaction, a stepwise scheme is employed that includes both H1 receptor blockers and H2 receptor blockers.

> [!NOTE] Antihistamines
> In antihistamines, a distinction is made between H2 receptor blockers, which primarily reduce stomach acid production, and H1 receptor blockers. The latter are mainly used as antihistamines in cases of itching or anaphylactic shock. Some H1 antihistamines are well-penetrating to the CNS due to their lipophilicity. By blocking the H1 receptors in the hypothalamus, they have a strong sedative effect and are actually only used when sedation is desired.

## Eicosanoid (Prostaglandin, Thromboxane A2, Leukotriene)

Eicosanoids refer to prostaglandins, thromboxane A2, and leukotrienes. All eicosanoids are derived from the polyunsaturated C20 fatty acid arachidonic acid. While lipoxygenase is essential for the synthesis of leukotrienes, the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 is catalyzed by cyclooxygenase. Clinically, this has significant relevance, as prostaglandins act on a variety of tissues. Their inhibition by COX inhibitors can therefore lead to potentially serious side effects. Additionally, prostaglandins are used therapeutically in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (pAVK) and in gynecology for labor induction.

|Metabolism|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Structure|- Arachidonic acid derivatives|   |
|Synthesis of Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes|- Location<br>    - Prostaglandins: A variety of different cell types, e.g., macrophages, endothelial cells, renal epithelium, parietal cells of the stomach<br>    - Thromboxane A2: Platelets<br>    - Leukotrienes: Various cell types of the immune defense, e.g., macrophages, granulocytes, and mast cells<br>- Starting substance: Fourfold unsaturated C20 fatty acid arachidonic acid, which is derived from the essential fatty acid linoleic acid<br>    - Arachidonic acid is released from the phospholipids of the cell membrane as needed via phospholipase A2<br>- Reaction process: Various eicosanoids can arise from arachidonic acid through two different reaction pathways:<br>    - Prostaglandins and Thromboxane A2<br>        - First cyclic intermediate: Under the incorporation of two oxygen molecules (2 O2), cyclooxygenase (COX; PGH synthase) catalyzes the formation of the cyclic prostaglandin H2 (PGH2)<br>        - Then conversion of PGH2 into the various prostaglandins (D, E, F, and I) and thromboxane A2<br>    - Leukotrienes<br>        - Lipoxygenase catalyzes the synthesis of leukotriene A4 also through the incorporation of molecular oxygen (O2)<br>        - Through further reaction steps, leukotriene A4 is converted into leukotrienes B4, C4 (through the addition of glutathione), D4, and E4|   |
|Release|- Activators of Phospholipase A2<br>    - Proinflammatory cytokines and bradykinin in the context of the inflammatory response<br>    - Growth factors (e.g., EGF)<br>    - Angiotensin II|   |

> [!NOTE]
> Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the first synthesis step of prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. In leukotriene synthesis, this is carried out by lipoxygenase!

> [!NOTE]
> PGI2 (Prostacyclin) inhibits platelet aggregation, Thromboxane A2 promotes it!

> [!NOTE] COX inhibitors and glucocorticoids
> The cyclooxygenase has a high clinical relevance, as COX inhibitors (non-opioid analgesics) are often used therapeutically. They act analgesically (pain-relieving), antipyretically (fever-reducing), and partly anti-inflammatory (inflammation-reducing). Most commonly, non-selective or preferential COX1 inhibitors (NSAIDs such as aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen) or COX inhibitors with additional functions like metamizole or paracetamol are used. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase occurs reversibly by blocking the binding site for arachidonic acid. This leads to a reduction in prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Since leukotriene synthesis is not affected, there are now more bronchoconstrictor leukotrienes present compared to the bronchodilatory prostaglandins, which can result in a so-called analgesic asthma as a side effect. Furthermore, the absence of renally produced prostaglandins leads to reduced renal blood flow, which can especially cause acute kidney damage in cases of pre-existing poor kidney function.
> The simultaneous intake of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs can still lead to a gastroduodenal ulcer: Due to the NSAID-induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, there is a reduction in protective mucus and bicarbonate production as well as an increased secretion of gastric acid. The glucocorticoids lead to an inhibition of phospholipase A2, which further reduces eicosanoid synthesis and promotes ulcer formation. Among the non-selective COX inhibitors, selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) must be distinguished, which are primarily used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or for postoperative pain management and produce fewer gastrointestinal side effects.

> [!NOTE] Prostaglandins in Pharmacotherapy
> Prostaglandins can be used in the treatment of various diseases. For example, Prostaglandin E1 (Alprostadil) is used for vasodilation in the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD Stage 3–4). Furthermore, prostaglandins are used in obstetrics. Prostaglandin E2 is used in the form of vaginal tablets or vaginal gel for cervical ripening and induction of labor.

> [!NOTE] Tissue injury / acute local inflammatory reaction
> Clinically, there are 5 cardinal signs of acute inflammation: redness (Rubor), heat (Calor), swelling/edema (Tumor), pain (Dolor), and a reduced function (Functio laesa). Following tissue damage, there is initially a brief ischemic phase during which the affected tissue is underperfused. Within minutes, phospholipase A2 is activated, resulting in an increase in prostaglandin synthesis. This, in turn, can lead to the sensitization of peripheral pain sensors, an increase in central pain perception (pain), as well as the induction of fever. Following the short ischemic phase, there is an acute decrease in the vascular tone of the arterioles and a constriction of the venules, resulting in consecutive hyperemia (redness and heat). Due to the resulting increase in intravascular pressure, there is also an escape of blood plasma into the tissue (swelling/edema). The slowing of blood flow and the activation of endothelial cells facilitate the passage of leukocytes through the cell wall. Within hours, cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL1) and chemokines are released due to the involvement of the innate immune system, and COX2 synthesis is increased. This maintains the inflammatory response and directs additional leukocytes to the site of inflammation. Overall, this usually results in a reduced function of the affected body part.

## Kinine (Bradykinin, Kallidin)

As kinins, the two peptide hormones bradykinin and kallidin are referred to. The inactive precursors (kininogens) produced by the liver must first be activated in the blood by serine proteases (kallikreins). These also exist as inactive protease precursors until activated by coagulation factor XII. Kinins are continuously released in small amounts from kininogen and can be upregulated in the context of inflammatory reactions or injuries. In addition to their role in the inflammatory response, kinins also play a role in the coagulation balance to prevent thrombosis. Due to their very short half-life, kinins act primarily quickly and in the short term.

|Metabolism|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Structure|- Bradykinin: Nonapeptide<br>- Kallidin: Decapeptide|   |
|Synthesis|- Precursors: The kinin precursors (kininogens) circulate as a complex with the inactive protease precursor (prekallikrein) in the blood until activation occurs.<br>    - Kininogens: Precursors of kinins<br>        - Produced in the liver and secreted into the blood<br>    - Prekallikrein: Precursor of kallikreins (serine proteases)<br>        - Predominantly synthesized in the liver<br>        - Inactive, but can be proteolytically activated as needed<br>- Activation of the protease: Prekallikrein is activated to<br>    - Plasma kallikrein through coagulation factor XII<br>    - Tissue kallikrein<br>- Reaction process: Kinins are cleaved from the kininogens by the activated serine proteases<br>    - Bradykinin: Released by plasma kallikrein<br>    - Kallidin: Released by tissue kallikrein|   |
|Release|- The release of kinins from kininogen occurs continuously to a small extent but can be intensified by inflammatory events or injuries|   |
|Breakdown|- Within seconds (half-life <1 min) by kinases (peptidases)|   |
|Effect|   |   |
|Molecular Mechanism of Action|- Currently, no difference in the effects of Bradykinin and Kallidin is known.<br>- Via G-protein-coupled receptors (B1 and B2 receptors) mainly on endothelial cells<br>    - Activation of NO synthase and cytosolic phospholipase A2<br>        - Release of arachidonic acid → Eicosanoid synthesis↑<br>        - Formation of NO and prostacyclin (PGI2)|   |
|Effect on Target Organ|- Vasodilation<br>- Increase in vascular permeability with enhanced leukocyte migration<br>- Pain stimulus through kinin receptors at nerve endings<br>- Antithrombotic effect on intact vascular endothelium<br>- Promoting coagulation on damaged endothelium|   |
## Zytokine

As cytokines, various mediators are grouped together, all of which belong to the polypeptides. Cytokines are synthesized in a variety of different cells and are usually secreted paracrine or autocrine, and rarely also endocrine. Therefore, they hold a special position among the mediators and are either assigned in the literature to the aglandular tissue hormones or presented as a separate class of hormone-like proteins. Functionally, the following substance groups are distinguished:

- Cytokine of the immune system
    - Interleukin
    - Interferon
    - Chemokine
    - TNF Superfamily
- Cytokines as growth factors
    - General growth factors
    - Hematopoietic growth factors

### Cytokine of the Immune System

Interleukins, interferons, chemokines, and the TNF superfamily can be summarized as cytokines of the immune system. Interleukins and interferons primarily serve as signaling molecules for intercellular communication. They essentially regulate the proliferation, differentiation, and function of the cells of the specific and nonspecific immune system. Chemokines act as signaling molecules for the attraction of immune cells to inflammatory tissue. Furthermore, they regulate the migration of leukocytes from the blood into the periphery or into the secondary lymphatic organs.

#### Interleukin

The family of interleukins is named after their function (from Latin inter = "between" and Greek leukos = "white") – the communication between white blood cells (leukocytes). With currently over 15 different subtypes, it is a very heterogeneous group of mediators, all of which have different functions and are secreted by different cells. With the exception of IL1 and IL8, they exert their effects through tyrosine kinase-associated receptors.

|Interleukin|Producing Cell|Target Cell/Tissue|Main Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|Interleukin 1 (IL1)|- Macrophages<br>- Monocytes<br>- Endothelial cells|- T-lymphocytes<br>- Endothelial cells<br>- Hypothalamus<br>- Liver|- Proinflammatory cytokine: Initiation of an inflammatory response<br>    - Stimulates the production of further proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL6) and prostaglandins<br>    - Activation of T-lymphocytes<br>    - Expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells → Facilitated leukocyte migration<br>    - Induction of acute-phase protein synthesis in the liver<br>    - Fever induction through action as an endogenous pyrogen on the hypothalamus together with IL6 and TNF-α|
|Interleukin 2 (IL2)|- T-Lymphocytes|- T-Lymphocytes<br>- B-Lymphocytes<br>- NK Cells|- Activation of lymphocytes and NK cells<br>- Proliferation stimulus for target cells|
|Interleukin 4 (IL4)|- TH2 cells<br>- Mast cells|- B lymphocytes<br>- T lymphocytes<br>- Monocytes<br>- Mast cells|- Proliferation stimulus for target cells:<br>    - Produced by TH2 cells → Positive feedback with enhanced differentiation of naive CD4-positive T lymphocytes into additional TH2 cells<br>- Inhibition of macrophage activation<br>- Stimulation of class switching to IgE|
|Interleukin 6 (IL6)|- Macrophages<br>- Monocytes<br>- Endothelial cells|- Immature T-lymphocytes (thymocytes)<br>- Mature B-cells<br>- Hypothalamus<br>- Liver|- Pro-inflammatory cytokine: Initiation of an inflammatory response<br>    - Stimulation of T and B lymphocytes<br>    - Induction of acute-phase protein synthesis in the liver<br>    - Fever induction in the hypothalamus together with IL1 and TNF-α|
|Interleukin 8 (IL8)|- Endothelial cells<br>- Monocytes<br>- Epithelial cells<br>- Fibroblasts|- Neutrophil granulocytes|- Pro-inflammatory cytokine: Initiation of an inflammatory reaction<br>    - Chemotaxis: Attraction of neutrophils and stimulation for degranulation<br>- Angiogenesis|
|Interleukin 10 (IL10)|- TH2 cells|- Macrophages|- Anti-inflammatory cytokine: Inhibits activated macrophages|
|The table shows only an excerpt of some important interleukins.|   |   |   |

#### Interferon

Interferons also serve the intercellular communication of immune cells. In total, they support the immune defense and are classified into 2 types according to their main function.

- Type I Interferons: IFN-α and IFN-β with primarily antiviral effects (e.g., by inducing the synthesis of antiviral proteins to block viral protein synthesis)
- Type II Interferon: IFN-γ as an important mediator of the general inflammatory response

|Interferon|   |Producing Cell|Target Cell/Target Tissue|Main Effect|Therapeutic Application|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Type-I-Interferons|Interferon-α (IFN-α)|- Macrophages<br>- Monocytes<br>- Virus-infected cells|- All cells|- Antiviral effect<br>    - Enhancement of MHC-I expression on body cells for improved antigen presentation, thus allowing better differentiation between infected and healthy cells by CD8+ cells → Stimulation of lysis of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes<br>    - Activation of NK cells by IFN-β<br>    - Induction of the synthesis of virostatic proteins for RNA degradation or blocking viral protein synthesis|- Interferon-α is used, among others, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and as an adjuvant therapy in malignant melanoma|
|Interferon-β (IFN-β)|- Fibroblasts<br>- Virus-infected cells|- NK cells|- Interferon-β is used as a standard therapy for Multiple Sclerosis|
|Type II Interferons|Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)|- T-lymphocytes (activated TH1 cells)|- Macrophages<br>- Monocytes<br>- Endothelial cells|- Important mediator of the inflammatory response<br>    - Stimulation and activation of target cells<br>    - Enhancement of antigen presentation through upregulation of MHC-I and MHC-II molecules<br>    - Shift of CD4+ cell differentiation towards pro-inflammatory TH1 cells|- Studies are investigating interferon-γ for the treatment of osteoporosis|

#### Chemokine

Chemokines are signaling molecules from different chemokine families that are responsible for directing leukocytes to the site of inflammation and facilitating leukocyte migration from the blood. Furthermore, they also support the migration of lymphocytes into secondary lymphatic organs. They thus provide the starting signal for the initiation of an inflammatory reaction. In addition to the members of the different chemokine families (CC or CXC families), other substances also have chemotactic functions. Typical representatives not belonging to a specific chemokine family include, for example, some complement factors (C3a, C4a, C5a). Interleukin 8 (CXCL8), on the other hand, is classified as part of the interleukin family and simultaneously belongs to the CXC chemokines.

#### TNF Superfamily

The TNF superfamily includes proteins that transmit their signals through the TNF receptor. They have a regulatory function on the survival or death of cells and the immune response. Likewise, they regulate the development and homeostasis of certain types of tissues, such as lymphatic, neural, or ectodermal tissues. Since TNF-α is particularly relevant clinically, the following will only address this representative of the TNF family.

|TNF superfamily|Producing cell|Target cell/target tissue|Main effect|Therapeutic application|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)|- Macrophages<br>- Monocytes<br>- T Lymphocytes|- Variety of cells|- Proinflammatory cytokine: Initiation of an inflammatory response<br>    - Activation of monocytes, neutrophils, and endothelial cells → Facilitated leukocyte migration through increased vascular permeability and upregulation of adhesion molecules<br>    - Stimulation of platelets with increased tendency for coagulation to contain an infection<br>    - Induction of acute-phase protein synthesis in the liver<br>    - Fever induction by acting as an endogenous pyrogen on the hypothalamus together with IL1 and IL6|- TNF-α blockers (!) such as Infliximab are used in therapy-refractory chronic inflammatory systemic diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease)|
|The table is merely an excerpt and does not claim to be complete.|   |   |   |   |

> [!NOTE]
> As the most important pro-inflammatory cytokines for inducing fever and the synthesis of acute-phase proteins, IL1, IL6, and TNF-α can be summarized!

> [!NOTE] SIRS/Sepsis
> As SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), it refers to a systemic inflammatory reaction of the body to various causes. "Sepsis" is a SIRS due to an infection, which is either confirmed by a positive pathogen detection or is clinically highly probable (e.g., in the presence of clear signs of pneumonia). Pathophysiologically, this involves the activation of local inflammatory mediators (complement system, mast cells, and macrophages), leading to vasodilation and the release of further pro-inflammatory cytokines (especially TNF-α, IL-1). This results in endothelial activation with increased vascular permeability and the associated generalized edema (with the escape of intravascular volume and albumin into the tissues). The fluid loss in the vascular system usually leads to a drop in blood pressure and septic shock. Together with the massive activation of coagulation by TNF-α, it can, in the worst case, lead to multiple organ failure. It is thus a life-threatening disease that poses a significant clinical challenge.

### Cytokines as Growth Factors

Cytokines not only play a crucial role in the immune system, but they also have an essential part in the regulation of embryonic and adult developmental processes as growth factors. In addition to general growth factors, hematopoietic growth factors are also classified as cytokines.

#### General Growth Factors

Growth factors are crucial both during embryonic development and in the adult organism. Important representatives include, for example, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), and Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGF-1 and 2). The following functions are attributed to the general growth factors:

- During embryonic development
    - Regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation as well as cell growth: Morphogenesis, organogenesis, and the formation of body axes
    - Regulation of cell survival and apoptosis
    - Specification of the growth direction for capillaries and axons (especially FGF and VEGF)
- In the adult organism
    - Control of cell proliferation and differentiation in renewable tissues
    - Regeneration processes after tissue damage
    - Regulation of cell survival and apoptosis

|Growth Factor|Function|
|---|---|
|Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)|- Promotes<br>    - Cell division<br>    - Differentiation of mesenchymal, neuroectodermal, and epithelial cells<br>- Involved in<br>    - Embryonic organ development<br>    - Wound healing|
|Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)|- Promotes<br>    - Epithelial cell division<br>    - Epithelial maturation in embryonic development<br>- Involved in<br>    - Wound healing|
|Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)|- Promotes<br>    - Capillary sprouting towards the secretion source<br>    - Endothelial proliferation|
|Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)|- Promotes<br>    - Growth and differentiation of nerve cells<br>    - Growth of axons towards the secretion source<br>- Regulation of neuropeptides<br>- Apoptosis inhibition|
|Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGF-1, IGF-2)|- Promotes<br>    - Cell division<br>    - Pre- and postnatal growth in bone length|
|Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) Family|- Essential for embryonic organ development<br>- Prevention of excessive immune response<br>- Stimulation and inhibition of cell division<br>- Biosynthesis of the extracellular matrix<br>- Wound healing<br>- Regulation of mesenchymal proliferation and differentiation|
|The table shows only an excerpt of some important general growth factors.|   |

#### Hematopoietic Growth Factors

Hematopoietic growth factors refer to cytokines that are involved in the regulation of blood formation. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and derive from a common multipotent stem cell. From this, the different blood cell lines then develop – depending on the cytokine profile and other interactions. The cytokines particularly influence the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of blood or blood precursor cells.

|Growth Factor|Effect|
|---|---|
|Stem Cell Factor (SCF)|- Proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells↑|
|Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)|- Proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic, monocytic precursor cells into neutrophilic granulocytes↑<br>- Therapeutic use: Improvement of neutropenias in chemotherapy|
|Erythropoietin (EPO)|- Proliferation and differentiation of myeloid stem cells and erythroid progenitor cells into erythrocytes↑ → Erythropoiesis↑<br>- Therapeutic use: EPO deficiency in renal anemia|
|Thrombopoietin (THPO)|- Proliferation and differentiation of myeloid stem cells into megakaryocytes↑ → Thrombopoiesis↑|
|The table only shows an excerpt of some important hematopoietic growth factors.|   |
## Review Questions on the Chapter on Tissue Hormones
### Histamine

How is histamine synthesized?
- Histamine is synthesized by decarboxylation from the amino acid histidine. This reaction is catalyzed by histidine decarboxylase with the help of the cofactor PALP (pyridoxal phosphate).
What stimulates the release of histamine?
- The release of histamine can be stimulated by many substances. For example, substance P or bradykinin can cause the release of histamine from mast cells and basophilic granulocytes. Likewise, gastrin leads to the release of histamine from ECL cells.
What effect does histamine have on blood vessels?
- Histamine can act vasoconstrictively or vasodilatively on vessels via H1 receptors. In arterioles and venules, it mainly causes vasodilation through receptors on endothelial cells, resulting in decreased vascular resistance and a drop in blood pressure. It also increases vascular permeability, leading to volume shift and edema formation. In large vessels, histamine acts rather vasoconstrictively via receptors on the smooth vascular muscle.

### Eicosanoid

How and from which substances do eicosanoids arise?
- Arachidonic acid, a fourfold unsaturated C20 fatty acid, is required for the synthesis of eicosanoids. It is formed from the essential fatty acid linoleic acid and, when needed, is released by phospholipase A2 from the phospholipid layer of cell membranes.
Explain the reaction process for the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2!
- From arachidonic acid, the cyclic prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) is formed by incorporation of 2 oxygen molecules. This reaction is catalyzed by cyclooxygenases 1 and 2 (COX1, 2). The precursor prostaglandin PGH2 is then converted into prostaglandins D2, E2, F2 and I2 (prostacyclin) or into thromboxane A2.
How are leukotrienes formed?
- Leukotriene A4 is formed from arachidonic acid by incorporation of oxygen molecules, catalyzed by lipoxygenase. From this precursor molecule, leukotrienes B4, C4, D4 and E4 are formed in further reaction steps.
Which leukotriene is formed by the addition of glutathione?
- Leukotriene C4 is formed by the addition of glutathione to leukotriene A4.
What effects of Prostaglandin E2 do you know?
- Prostaglandin E2 causes relaxation (thus vasodilation) in smooth muscle and reduces lipolysis. In the stomach, it acts protectively by reducing gastric juice secretion and increasing mucin and bicarbonate secretion. Additionally, it increases pain sensitivity and amplifies inflammatory reactions. It also raises core body temperature (fever).
Where is Prostaglandin I2 produced and what does it do?
- Prostaglandin I2 is produced by the endothelium from arachidonic acid and causes vasodilation as well as decreased platelet aggregation.
Who can be understood as an antagonist of prostaglandin I2 and how can its inhibition be therapeutically utilized (e.g., in cardiology)?
- Thromboxane A2 is the antagonist to prostaglandin I2. It acts vasoconstrictively and promotes platelet aggregation. Inhibition of its synthesis, for example by irreversible inhibition of COX1 by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), results in inhibition of platelet aggregation, which is used for reinfarction prophylaxis after myocardial infarction.
How do non-opioid analgesics interfere with the synthesis of eicosanoids?
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are unselective COX inhibitors but preferentially inhibit COX1. This leads to decreased synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which is why they have analgesic (pain-relieving), antipyretic (fever-reducing), and partially anti-inflammatory effects. Leukotriene synthesis is not affected.
What effect do quinines have?
- Kinins are increasingly released during inflammatory reactions, act as vasodilators, and increase vascular permeability. On intact vascular endothelium, they have antithrombotic effects, but on injured endothelium, they promote coagulation. They also mediate pain signals.

### Cytokine

What effects of Interleukin 8 do you know?
- Interleukin 8 (IL8) is a proinflammatory cytokine. Its secretion initiates an inflammatory reaction by attracting neutrophils (chemotaxis) and stimulating their degranulation.
