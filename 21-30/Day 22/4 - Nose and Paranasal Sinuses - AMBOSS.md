# Nose and Paranasal Sinuses
## Summary

With every breath, air first flows through the nose and then passes through the airways to the alveoli in the lungs, where gas exchange takes place. The nose consists of an external part located in the center of the face and a part within the skull. While the external nose is made up of a centrally located nasal septum and two nasal wings, the part located in the skull is composed of the continuation of the septum, bony walls to the right and left, above and below, as well as the cavities (nasal cavity in the stricter sense) bordered by these structures. From the lateral walls, bony structures called nasal turbinates protrude into the nasal cavity, each of which in turn defines a nasal passage. At the back opening, the nasal cavity transitions into the upper part of the throat (nasopharynx). Additionally, connected to this system are the four paired so-called paranasal sinuses, which serve as resonance spaces.

As the first anatomical region through which inhaled air passes, the nose plays an important role. It acts like a guardian: during inhalation, the sense of smell checks the incoming air for its quality, while the mucous membranes "prepare" the air by warming, moistening, and cleaning it.
## External Nose and Nasal Cavity (= Cavitas Nasi)

### Macroscopic Anatomy

#### Profile

- Function: Humidification, heating, cleaning, and control of the breathing air
- Location: Center of the face (outer nose) up to the pharynx (= nasal cavity)
- Form
    - External nose: septum, two wings
    - Nasal cavity: septum, three turbinates and three nasal passages on each side

#### Structure

The entrance to the paired nasal cavities is formed by the external nose with the nostrils. In front of the actual nasal cavity (= Cavitas nasi) lies the nasal vestibule (= Vestibulum nasi). The nasal cavities are separated by the so-called nasal septum (= Septum nasi). On the lateral nasal wall, there are three nasal conchae (= Conchae nasales), beneath which runs a nasal meatus (= Meatus nasi). The posterior openings of the nasal cavities (= Choanae) lead to the nasopharynx. Additionally, the nasal cavity is connected to the paranasal sinuses (= Sinus paranasales). The nasal skeleton consists of three different tissues from cranial to caudal-distal: bone, connective tissue, and cartilage.

        - Lateral crus (= lateral limb)
    - Minor alar cartilages (lit. "smaller nasal wing cartilages")
- Cartilage of the nasal septum (= Septum nasi)
    - Cartilage of the nasal septum

##### Nasal Turbinates

The nasal turbinates are bony, spiral projections of the lateral nasal wall covered with mucous membrane. They are slightly offset from one another.

- Superior nasal concha (= Concha nasalis superior)
- Middle nasal concha (= Concha nasalis media)
- Inferior nasal concha (= Concha nasalis inferior)

##### Nasal passages

The nasal passages are located beneath the corresponding nasal concha.

- Superior nasal meatus (= Meatus nasi superior)
    - Mouth of
        - Posterior ethmoid cells (= Cellulae ethmoidales posteriores)
        - Sphenoid sinus (= Keilbeinhöhle)
- Middle nasal meatus (= Meatus nasi medius)
    - Mouth of
        - Anterior and middle ethmoid air cells (= Cellulae ethmoidales anteriores und mediales)
        - Frontal sinus
        - Maxillary sinus
- Lower nasal passage (= Meatus nasi inferior)
    - Opening of the nasolacrimal duct

##### Access to the nasal cavity

- Nostrils (= Nares): The outer front openings to the nose
- Nasal vestibule (= Vestibulum nasi): Between the outside world and the nasal cavity
- Limen nasi: Boundary line between the nostril vestibule and cavity
- Piriform aperture (lit. "pear-shaped opening"): Anterior nasal opening of the skull bone
- Choanen (= Choanae): The paired choanae form the posterior opening of the nasal cavity.

|Cranial|- Anterior cranial fossa<br>- Frontal sinus|
|Caudal|- Maxilla|
|Dorsal|- Nasopharynx<br>- Sphenoid sinus|
|Ventral|- Nasal vestibule|
|Lateral|- Maxillary sinus|

> [!NOTE] Spread of infections
> Due to the many physiological connections of the facial area to other structures of the skull, pathogens from infection foci in the facial area can be transferred to preformed cranial cavities, blood vessels, or the CNS, potentially causing thrombosis or brain abscesses. One such connection exists, among others, between the pterygoid plexus and the meninges via the middle meningeal veins. Particularly in the middle facial region, there are several anastomoses (connections) between superficial facial veins and the venous system of the cranial cavity, which is why no mechanical manipulation should be performed in the presence of abscesses.

## Nasal sinuses (= Sinus paranasales)

### Macroscopic Anatomy

The four paired paranasal sinuses (= sinus paranasales) are located in different skull bones, but they are all directly connected to the nasal cavity. For example, infections can spread quite rapidly between the individual spaces.

#### Topography
| |Location|Neighboring Structures|Mouth|Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Frontal sinus (= frontal cavity)|- In the frontal bone|- Cranial and dorsal<br>    - Anterior cranial fossa<br>- Caudal<br>    - Orbit|- Middle nasal passage|- Separated from the frontal sinus of the opposite side by the interfrontal septum|

> [!NOTE] Skull fracture
> In the context of skull fractures, particularly thin bony walls are easily damaged. The nasal sinuses are often affected in skull traumas, as many of their bony boundaries are quite thin. Depending on the type of force applied, for example, the septum between the left and right frontal sinuses may break, or also the orbital floor, which is located between the orbit and the maxillary sinus. In the latter case, it is referred to as a "blow-out fracture."

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Frontal sinus and ethmoidal sinus<br>    - Ethmoidal arteries from ophthalmic artery from internal carotid artery<br>- Maxillary sinus<br>    - Ethmoidal arteries from ophthalmic artery from internal carotid artery<br>    - Infraorbital artery and posterior superior alveolar artery from maxillary artery|
|Venous|- V. facialis into V. jugularis interna<br>- Ethmoidal veins into superior ophthalmic vein<br>- Pterygoid plexus into V. jugularis interna|

|Lymph drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Submandibular lymph nodes<br>- Retropharyngeal lymph nodes<br>- Deep cervical lymph nodes|

> [!NOTE] Sinusitis
> Sinusitis refers to an inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. The origin of the disease is usually an inflammation of the ethmoid cells (Cellulae ethmoidales), which then swell and block the secretion flow from the frontal and maxillary sinuses into the ostiomeatal complex. The resulting secretion congestion causes germs to remain in the other paranasal sinuses, leading to inflammation there as well. In chronically affected patients, efforts are made to clear this anatomical narrowing to facilitate the unobstructed drainage of secretions.

## Microscopic Anatomy

According to their epithelial composition and functionality, the nasal cavity is divided into a respiratory region (= respiratory nasal mucosa), which is primarily located in the inferior and middle nasal concha, and an olfactory region (= olfactory mucosa), which mainly involves the superior nasal concha, the nasal roof, and the upper nasal septum. Additionally, a smaller cutaneous region can be delineated, which is located in the area of the nasal vestibule and transitions into the outer skin.

- Classification (by epithelium type and functionality):
    - Cutaneous region (= Skin region)
    - Respiratory region (= respiratory nasal mucosa)
    - Olfactory region (= olfactory mucosa)

### Skin region

The nasal vestibule is lined with an epidermis and is thus histologically similar in structure to the outer wing of the nose. For this reason, this region is also referred to as the cutaneous region (= skin region).

- Epidermis: Transition between the keratinized stratified epithelium of the external nose and the mucous membrane of the internal nose.
    - Hair (Vibrissae)
    - Sebaceous glands
    - Apocrine sweat glands
- Dermis
- Hyaline cartilage plate
- Cavernous plexus of the turbinates (= Kiesselbach's area)

> [!NOTE] Nosebleed
> Epistaxis (from Greek epistaxo = "to drip") is the technical term for nosebleeds. A common starting point is the vessels of the venous plexus "Locus Kiesselbachi" that run along the nasal septum. While in anterior bleeds the blood comes from the nose, in posterior bleeds it can also run down the throat. The bleeding usually stops spontaneously; helpful initial measures include sitting the person upright, applying a cold compress to the neck, and pinching the nostrils together.

> [!NOTE]
> The Kiesselbach's area is supplied by the drainage regions of the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery! Nosebleeds can therefore potentially be stopped at different locations of the arterial system!

### Respiratory region

The respiratory region encompasses the largest part of the nasal cavity: It has components in the septum, side walls, and nasal turbinates.

- Mucous membrane (mucosa)
    - Respiratory epithelium (pseudostratified columnar epithelium with cilia)
        - Ciliated cells: The cilia of the ciliated cells transport, with their beat, e.g., dust or secretions towards the throat to keep the airways clear; beat frequency of 10 to 20/s
        - Goblet cells: Mucus secretion
        - Basal cells: Stem cells
        - Intraepithelial Leukocytes: Immune Defense
        - Basal membrane
- Lamina propria
    - Nasal glands (= Nasal glands)
    - Immune cells: In particular, plasma cells, mast cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes
    - Connective tissue
    - Vascular system
        - Arteries: Branching into a highly fenestrated capillary network
        - Veins: Wide venous plexus (see "Cavernous plexus of conchae")
            - Function
                - Warming of the inhaled air
                - Corpus cavernosum
        - Arteriovenous Anastomoses
    - Nerves

> [!NOTE] Rhinitis
> In the case of a cold (medical term: rhinitis, meaning nasal inflammation), an increased amount of mucus is released from the epithelial lining of the nose. Additionally, the significantly dilated blood vessels due to the inflammation can cause considerable swelling of the mucous membrane, leading to obstructed nasal breathing and a sensation of "congestion" in the nose. The nasal drops commonly prescribed for rhinitis act as agonists at α1-receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, causing vasoconstriction (i.e., narrowing of blood vessels) and thereby reducing swelling of the mucous membrane and facilitating nasal breathing. Due to the relief effect that many patients find pleasant, these preparations are often used well beyond the duration of rhinitis. However, this is strongly discouraged, as it can damage the mucous membrane and easily lead to a tolerance effect. Consequently, this can result in a reactive increased swelling of the mucous membrane upon later discontinuation of the medication.

### Olfactory region (= olfactory mucosa)

The olfactory region is responsible for the perception of smell. It covers the upper nasal concha, the nasal dome, and the upper part of the nasal septum.

- Epithelium of the olfactory region: Pseudostratified columnar epithelium
    - Olfactory sensory cells: Primary sensory cells
    - Basal cells: Stem cells
    - Support cells
    - Microvilli cells: Function unclear
- Lamina propria
    - Bowman glands (= olfactory glands)

### Mucosa of the Paranasal Sinuses

The paranasal sinuses are part of the respiratory region and thus also possess respiratory ciliated epithelium. Only the cell height and the density of goblet cells in the respiratory region of the paranasal sinuses are lower than in the nasal cavity.
## Function

During its passage through the nasal cavity, the inhaled air is not only warmed and humidified, but also freed from larger particles, pollutants, and bacteria before being taken into the lungs, and its quality is checked through the sense of smell to protect the organism from harmful influences.

- Function of the nasal cavity: To trap larger particles through vibrissae (= bristle-like hairs)
- Functions of mucosa, immune cells, and vascular plexus
    - Humidification of the inhaled air
    - Warming of the inhaled air
    - Binding of pollutants and bacteria
- Functions of the olfactory mucosa
    - Smell
    - Chemical control of the breathing air
    - Perception of fragrances
- Functions of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses
    - Language education
        - Formation of nasal sounds (e.g. "m" and "n") when speaking
        - Resonance chambers when speaking and singing
        - Reduction of total skull weight

## Review Questions on the Chapter Nose and Paranasal Sinuses
### External Nose and Nasal Cavity (= Cavitas Nasi)

Which structures are involved in the formation of the lateral nasal wall?
- The lateral nasal wall consists of the frontal process of the maxilla, the lacrimal bone, the ethmoid bone, the inferior nasal concha, and the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone.
Which structures drain into the three nasal passages?
- The three paired nasal passages primarily drain the paranasal sinuses: The posterior ethmoidal air cells and the sphenoidal sinus open into the superior nasal meatus, while the anterior and middle ethmoidal air cells as well as the frontal and maxillary sinuses drain into the middle nasal meatus. The nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior nasal meatus.
How is the nasal cavity supplied with arteries?
- In the arterial supply of the nasal cavity, a distinction is made between its anterior and posterior parts. The anterior portion of the nasal cavity is supplied by the ethmoidal arteries from the ophthalmic artery. The posterior part is supplied by the posterior lateral and septal arteries from the sphenopalatine artery as well as by the posterior ethmoidal artery from the ophthalmic artery.
### Nasal sinuses (= Paranasal sinuses)

Which sinus is located directly below the orbit?
- The maxillary sinus lies directly below the orbit and is separated from it only by a thin bony wall, the orbital floor.
How are the mucous membranes of the sinuses sensitively innervated?
- The three paranasal sinuses are sensitively innervated by branches of the maxillary and ophthalmic nerves. The maxillary nerve supplies the maxillary sinus via the infraorbital nerve and the alveolar nerves. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves arising from the ophthalmic nerve innervate the anterior ethmoidal air cells and the frontal sinus, as well as the posterior ethmoidal air cells and the sphenoidal sinus, respectively.
### Microscopic Anatomy

What belongs to the so-called respiratory region and which type of epithelium is present here?
- The respiratory region includes the part of the nasal mucosa involved in breathing (parts of the septum, the lateral walls, and the nasal conchae) as well as the mucosa of the paranasal sinuses. The respiratory region is characteristically lined by pseudostratified ciliated epithelium.
