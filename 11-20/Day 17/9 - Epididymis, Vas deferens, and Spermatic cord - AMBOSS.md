# Epididymis, Vas deferens, and Spermatic cord
## Summary

The epididymis is located dorsal to the testis. Its functions include the further differentiation and storage of spermatozoa as well as their transport into the vas deferens. The epididymis is connected to the testis by several efferent ductules. They drain into the epididymal duct, which runs through the epididymis in many twists along its entire length. From the epididymis, the mature spermatozoa are transported through the vas deferens via the inguinal canal and along the bladder until they exit into the urethra at the level of the seminal hillock. During emission, the transport is actively supported by the well-developed smooth muscle layer of the vas deferens, propelling the spermatozoa in peristaltic waves toward the urethra and penis.

The spermatic cord (funiculus spermaticus) includes the vas deferens and all important blood vessels of the testis and epididymis from the internal inguinal ring to the upper pole of the testis. This special supply structure arises from embryonic development, as the testis is formed in the abdominal cavity but descends into the scrotum during development. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on the epididymis, spermatic cord, and testis in the respective chapter sections.
## Epididymis (Epididymis)

### Macroscopic Anatomy

#### Profile

- Function: Final maturation and transport of sperm
- Location: Located dorsal to the testicle in the scrotum, surrounded by testicular coverings.
- Shape: Bell-shaped
- Size: 5 cm long

The epididymis is slightly palpable as a soft structure at the upper pole of the turgid testis!

#### Structure

- Structure: Mainly consists of the tightly coiled epididymal duct (Ductus epididymidis)
    - Length (ductus epididymidis): Coiled total length of 5–6 m, tightly packed to about 5–6 cm
- Sections
    1. Caput epididymidis (= epididymis head): Opening for about 10 efferent ductules from the testis
    2. Corpus epididymidis (= epididymal body): Main part of the epididymis, which consists solely of the ductus epididymidis.
    3. Tail of the epididymis (= cauda epididymidis): Transition into the vas deferens
- Bands: Superior and inferior epididymal ligaments: Fixation of the epididymis to the testis

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation

The vascular supply and innervation of the epididymis corresponds to that of the testis (see: vascular supply and innervation of the testis and epididymis).

> [!NOTE] Epididymitis (= Epididymitis)
> The inflammation of the epididymis is common and is accompanied by pain and increasing swelling in the scrotum. The triggers are usually urinary tract infections (especially in older men) or sexually transmitted diseases. If the epithelium of the epididymal duct becomes adhesively affected by the inflammation (especially at the narrow point where the body of the epididymis transitions to the tail), it can, in the worst case, lead to infertility.

## Seminal Duct (Ductus deferens)

The paired vas deferens (= ductus deferentes) form the connection between the two epididymides and the urethra and serve to transport sperm.

### Macroscopic Anatomy

#### Profile

- Function: Sperm transport
- Form: Tubular with a star-shaped lumen and thick muscular wall
- Length: approx. 40 cm
- Diameter: 3 mm

#### Structure and Topography

The vas deferens runs from the epididymis into the small pelvis and opens into the urethra. It is divided along its course into six sections.

|Sections of the Vas Deferens|Course|
|---|---|
|Epididymal part of the ductus deferens|1. Departure from the epididymis|
|Path of the spermatic cord vas deferens|2. Course within the spermatic cord (Funiculus spermaticus)|
|Inguinal part of the ductus deferens|
|3. Passage through the inguinal canal|
|4. Crossing of the external iliac artery and vein|
|Pelvic portion of the ductus deferens|5. Entry into the small pelvis|
|6. Crossing of the ureter|
|Ampulla ductus deferentis|7. Union with the excretory duct of the seminal vesicle|
|Ejaculatory duct|8. Entry into the tissue of the prostate from dorsal|
|9. Opening into the posterior wall of the urethra|

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. ductus deferentis from A. umbilicalis|
|Venous|- Pampiniform plexus in the testicular vein  <br>    Venous plexus of the bladder in the vesical veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Sympathetic|- Lumbar splanchnic nerves<br>- Inferior hypogastric plexus|
|Parasympathetic|- Pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2–4)|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes| - Lumbar lymph nodes|

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Ductus Deferens

The sperm duct has a three-layered structure. Its characteristic histological feature is the strongly developed muscular wall with a narrow, folded central lumen in cross-section.

- Mucous membrane
    - Double-layered, cylindrical epithelium with stereocilia and partly with mucosal folds
    - Features in the course:
        - Ampulla of the vas deferens
            - High mucosal folds
            - Dilation of the lumen with secretory activity
        - Ejaculatory duct: Columnar epithelium
- Tunica muscularis: Thick three-layered smooth muscle
    - Stratum longitudinale internum: Inner longitudinal layer
    - Stratum circulare: Circular layer (flat screw-like turns), thickest part
    - Stratum longitudinale externum: Outer longitudinal layer
- Tunica adventitia: Connective tissue sheath

### Function of the Vas Deferens

- Sperm transport: During ejaculation, the smooth muscle wall of the vas deferens contracts rapidly and propels mature sperm into the urethra in several peristaltic waves.
- The ampulla of the ductus deferens also serves to store and nourish sperm cells.

### Spermatic Cord (Funiculus spermaticus)

The spermatic cord bundles important conduits of the testes. As a result of the embryonic descent of the testes, the spermatic cord physiologically passes through the inguinal canal. It is surrounded by the coverings of the testes, which originate from the layers of the abdominal wall (see: coverings of the testes).

- Course: Deep inguinal ring → Inguinal canal → Superficial inguinal ring → Upper extremity of the testis
- Length: approx. 20 cm

## Review Questions on the Chapter Epididymis, Vas Deferens, and Spermatic Cord
### Epididymis (Epididymis)

How do immature sperm reach maturity in the epididymis?
- Functionally immature spermatozoa are produced in the testis, which then develop into mature sperm in the epididymis. The transport of the still immotile spermatozoa within the ductuli efferentes occurs with the help of peristaltic movements of peritubular myofibroblasts and is supported by coordinated movements of the cilia on the epithelium.

### Seminal Duct (Ductus deferens)

Through which autonomic nerves is the ductus deferens innervated? What is the purpose of this innervation?
- During ejaculation, the smooth muscle wall of the ductus deferens contracts and propels mature sperm in several peristaltic waves into the urethra. The sympathetic innervation of the muscle cells is provided by the lumbar splanchnic nerves (Nn. splanchnici lumbales) and fibers from the inferior hypogastric plexus, while the parasympathetic innervation is provided by the pelvic splanchnic nerves (Nn. splanchnici pelvici).
