# Tactile System
## Summary

Through touch and feeling, humans receive information about their environment and their own body. In this context, they can differentiate between the perception of the external world (e.g., through the sense of touch) and the perception of the body's interior (e.g., through proprioception). The senses are conveyed through various types of sensors that are distributed throughout the body. The sense of touch includes the three qualities of pressure, touch, and vibration. The temperature sense perceives changes in skin temperature and differentiates between warmth and cold sensations. Proprioception informs the brain about the position and movement of the body. The transmission of stimuli occurs via the sensory pathway, particularly to the sensory cortex, where the perception and awareness of the respective stimulus take place.
## Taste and Touch Overview

In the sense of touch and proprioception, a distinction is made between the perception of the external world (exteroception) and the perception of the body's interior (interoception). The exteroception consists of the sense of touch and temperature, while interoception consists of deep sensitivity (proprioception) and visceral sensitivity (enterception). Together, these components are referred to as modalities.

| |Modality|Sensory Qualities (Submodalities)|
|---|---|---|
|Exteroception (perception of the external world)|Sense of touch|- Pressure<br>- Touch<br>- Vibration|
|Temperature Sense|- Heat<br>- Cold|
|Interoception (perception of the body's interior)|Proprioception (deep sensitivity)|- Position<br>- Movement<br>- sense of force|
|Interoception/Visceroception|Sensory impressions of the internal organs (visceral sensitivity)|

> [!NOTE]
> The coarse sense of pressure and touch, as well as temperature and pain sensation, is sometimes summarized in the literature as "protopathic sensitivity." However, since this definition is very vague, it is no longer recommended. The same applies to the term "epicritic sensitivity," which summarizes the fine touch sensations!

## Sense of Taste

The sense of touch consists of the three sensory qualities of pressure, touch, and vibration. Each of these qualities is conveyed through so-called mechanoreceptors. There are three different groups of mechanoreceptors, each of which responds to either pressure (pressure sensors), speed (touch sensors), or acceleration (vibration sensors). The mechanoreceptors are unevenly distributed throughout the body and are primarily found in the fingertips, on the tongue, and in the oral cavity. Depending on their respective adaptation behavior, proportional and differential sensors are distinguished.

### Mechanosensors

Mechanosensors are corpuscular endings (specialized sensor bodies) of Aβ fibers. For the different sensory qualities, there are different mechanosensors.

|Sensory Quality|Mechanosensors|
|---|---|
|Pressure|- Merkel cells<br>- Ruffini corpuscles|
|Touch|- Meissner corpuscles<br>- Hair follicle sensors|
|Vibration|- Pacinian Corpuscles|

#### Pressure Sensors

Drucksensoren are proportional sensors and react to the deformation of the skin due to pressure.

| |Merkel Cells|Ruffini Corpuscles|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|- Specialized sensory cells that are connected to its axon through a synaptic contact (Merkel cell-axon complex)|- Cylinder-shaped complex consisting of a branched axon, associated collagen fibers, and surrounding perineural capsule|
|Occurrences|- Hairless skin: Merkel cells<br>- Hairy skin: Merkel discs|- Hairless and hairy skin|
|Location|- Merkel cells: Stratum basale of the epidermis<br>- Merkel discs: Stratum papillare of the dermis|- Deep layers of the dermis|
|Activation|- By applying pressure perpendicular to the skin surface (sensitivity optimum at approximately 5–15 Hz)<br>- Activation of the mechanically regulated Piezo2 ion channels|- By stretching the tissue (shear forces)|
|Phase quality of the axon|- Aβ fibers|- Aβ fibers|
|Sensor Type|- Proportional-Differential Sensors (SA-I Sensors)|- Proportional Sensors (SA-II Sensors)|

> [!NOTE]
> Merkel cells together with the axon terminal form the Merkel cell-axon complex (synapse-like connection)!

> [!NOTE]
> Merkel cells have the highest spatial resolution of all mechanosensors and respond particularly sensitively to moving objects! This allows for better detection of the shape of an object (e.g., the dots of Braille) when one slowly sweeps a finger over it rather than just placing the finger on the object. In addition to the Merkel cells, the Meissner corpuscles are important for reading Braille!

#### Touch Sensors

Touch sensors are differential sensors and register the speed at which the skin is deformed or a hair is moved.

| |Meissner corpuscles|Hair follicle sensors|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|- A bulbous complex consisting of an axon, 5–10 layer-stacked Schwann cells, a perineural capsule, and collagen fibers, which are connected to the basal lamina of the epidermis| Various sensors that surround the hair follicles (e.g., free nerve endings, Merkel cell-axon complexes)|
|Occurrences|- Hairless Skin|- Hairy Skin|
|Location|- Papillary layer of the Dermis|- Dermis|
|Activation|- Deformation of the skin (sensitivity optimum at about 20–50 Hz)|- Displacement velocity of the hair follicles|
|Phase quality of the axon|- Aβ fibers|- Aβ fibers|
|Sensor type|- Differential sensors (RA sensors)|- Differential sensors (RA sensors)|

#### Vibration Sensors

Vibration sensors are differential sensors and respond to the acceleration of a skin deformation.

| |Pacinian corpuscles|
|---|---|
|Definition|- Complex made up of an axon, onion-skin-like Schwann cells, and a perineural capsule|
|Occurrences|- Hairless and hairy skin|
|Location|- Subcutaneous Connective tissue|
|Activation|- Vibrations of the skin (sensitivity optimum at about 100–400 Hz)|
|Phase quality of the axon|- Aβ fibers|
|Sensor Type|- Differential Sensors (PC Sensors)|

> [!NOTE]
> Merkel is always under political pressure. Meissen porcelain may only be handled with care. Father Pacini is an opera singer with a prominent vibrato in his voice. Only Ruffini remains: But he "doesn't care" about how to best remember his function.

### Distribution of Mechanosensors (Touch Points)

The mechanosensors of the skin convey tactile stimuli (pressure, touch, vibration) and are unevenly distributed across the skin. The areas of the skin where mechanosensors are located and that are thus sensitive to touch are referred to as touch points.

- Definition: Skin areas that possess mechanosensors and are therefore sensitive to touch.
- Distribution density
    - Touch-sensitive areas contain many touch points (e.g. hand: About 20 touch points per cm2 skin)
    - Touch insensitive areas contain few touch points (e.g., back: about 1 touch point per cm2 skin)

### Threshold

- Definition
    - The minimum distance that two mechanical skin stimuli must have from each other in order to still be perceived as separate.
    - The more touch points an area of skin has, the lower the threshold of space is.
- Types
    1. Simultaneous Spatial Threshold (Two-Point Discrimination)
        - Meaning: Distance at which two simultaneously triggered stimuli can still be recognized as spatially separate.
        - Examples: Tip of the tongue (1 mm), Fingerpad (2 mm), Back (54 mm)
    2. Successive Spatial Threshold (dynamic Two-Point Discrimination)
        - Meaning: Distance at which two sequentially presented stimuli can still be recognized as spatially separate
        - Smaller than the simultaneous space threshold (approximately ¼ of the simultaneous space threshold)

> [!NOTE]
> A touch point does not consist of a single mechanosensor. There are significantly more mechanosensors than touch points!

### Temperature Sense

Thermosensors are free nerve endings that enable the skin to sense warmth and cold. Similar to tactile points, there are cold and warm points distributed on the skin - however, there are significantly fewer cold and warm points than tactile points. Only at these locations can temperature stimuli be perceived. Most thermosensors are found on the face or on the lips. The sensations of "warm" and "cold" are conveyed by two different sensors, known as cold and warm sensors.

### Thermosensors

| |Cold Sensors|Warm Sensors|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|- Free nerve endings with cold- or heat-activated channels|   |
|Occurrences|- Face > Upper body > Abdomen > Extremities<br>- There are more cold sensors than warm sensors (ratio about 10:1)|   |
|Location|- Directly under the epidermis|- Dermis|
|Temperature limits|- Indifference temperature: Approximately 31–35°C|   |
|- Perception range: 8–38°C<br>- Maximum effect: 20–30°C<br>- Below 15°C additional excitation of pain fibers (cold pain)|- Perception range: 29–45°C<br>- Maximum effect: 38–43°C<br>- Above 45°C additional excitation of pain fibers (heat pain)|
|Activation|- Under- or exceeding the indifference temperature|   |
|Activation mechanism|- Temperature-sensitive ion channels from the TRP channel family (transient receptor potential channels)|   |
|- Cold-activated channel: TRPM8 or CMR1 (Cold and Menthol Receptor)<br>- In response to a painful cold stimulus, TRPA1 channels (Nociception) are activated|- Heat-activated channel: TRPV1 or VR1 (Vanilloid receptor or Capsaicin receptor)<br>- Painful heat stimuli are perceived through the TRPV1 channel (Nociception), while mild warming is sensed via the TRPV3 or TRPV4 channel|
|Phase quality of the Axons|- Many Aδ fibers<br>- Few C fibers|- Few Aδ fibers<br>- Many C fibers|
|Sensor Type|- Proportional-Differential Sensor (PD Sensor)|   |

> [!NOTE]
> A part of the cold sensors has, in addition to the CMR1 channels, some VR1 channels as well. Therefore, cold sensors start sending out action potentials again above 45°C (paradoxical cold sensation). This phenomenon is known from everyday life when you briefly hold your hand under water that is too hot and it seems to you as if the water is cold!

#### Adaptation

Thermosensors are proportional-differential sensors that do not register absolute temperature but only the changes in body temperature as well as the rate of change. Thus, with a change in temperature, there is initially a strong increase in the impulse rate. However, if the temperature is then maintained, the sensory response decreases again. The thermosensors thus exhibit a slow but very pronounced adaptation to constant stimuli.

- Testing of Adaptation: Two-Shell Experiment according to Weber
    1. One hand is held in warm water (38°C) and the other in cold water (26°C)
    2. After a short time, the perceived temperature difference decreases (Adaptation of the thermosensors)
    3. Now both hands are held together in 33°C warm water.
    4. The water feels cold to the previously warmed hand and warm to the previously cooled hand (registration of temperature differences)
## Depth Sensitivity (Proprioception)

The deep sensitivity (proprioception) consists of positional, movement, and force sense and provides information about the position and movement of the body in space. This information reaches, on one hand, the sensory cortex, where it is consciously perceived, and on the other hand, the cerebellum, where unconscious movement coordination occurs. The sensors for deep sensitivity are located in the muscles, tendons, and joints.

1. Sense of position (syn. sense of orientation): Provides information about the initial position of the joints
2. Sense of movement: Provides information about the speed and direction of a positional change.
3. Kraft sense: Provides information about the applied force of the musculature

| |Sensors of proprioception|   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Muscle spindles|Golgi tendon organ|Joint sensors|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|- Spindle-shaped complex made up of about 10 so-called intrafusal muscle fibers, some spirally wrapped nerve fibers, and an surrounding perineural capsule|- Spindle-shaped complex of collagen fiber bundles with interspersed, branched nerve fibers and an enclosing perineural capsule|- Various structures for measuring joint capsule stretch (e.g., free nociceptive nerve endings and Ruffini endings)|
|Location|- Parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers|- Transition from muscles to tendons (in series with the extrafusal musculature)|- Joint capsule|
|Activation|- Change in muscle length: γ-motoneurons innervate the intrafusal muscle fibers and regulate the sensitivity of the muscle spindles|- Stretching and contraction of the muscle (muscle tension): Ib-afferents of the Golgi tendon organs transmit information about muscle tension to the spinal cord<br>    - Excitation of inhibitory interneurons → Inhibition of the α-motoneurons of the muscle, through which the Golgi tendon organs provided the signal → Termination of contraction, among other things, as protection against overstretching (Golgi tendon reflex)<br>    - Excitation of excitatory interneurons → Excitation of antagonistic α-motoneurons → Contraction of the antagonistic muscles|- Stretching of the joint capsule|
|Phase quality of the Axon|- Aα fibers|- Aα fibers|- Aβ fibers<br>- Aδ fibers<br>- C fibers|
|Sensortyp|- Proportional-Differential Sensor (PD Sensor)|- Proportional-Differential Sensor (PD Sensor)|- Proportional-Differential Sensor (PD Sensor)|

> [!NOTE]
> The deep sensitivity is mediated by the joint perception of specific sensors in the muscles (muscle spindles), tendons (Golgi tendon organ) and joints (joint sensors). In addition, stretch-sensitive mechanosensors also contribute to deep sensitivity. This is especially true for Ruffini corpuscles, as they run parallel to the lines of tension in the skin!

## The Sensitive Train

The sensors of temperature and touch as well as proprioception are primary sensory cells. The cell bodies of the sensors are located in the spinal ganglia. The further course of the axons of the thermosensors differs slightly from the course of the axons of the proprioceptors and mechanosensors. The axons of the afferent neurons of the temperature sensors enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root and synapse onto the 2nd neuron in the dorsal horn. The fibers of the neurons of touch and deep sensitivity also enter the spinal cord, but then travel directly without synapsing through the dorsal columns into the brainstem and are only then synapsed onto the 2nd neuron. The common destination is the somatosensory cortex, which is located on the postcentral gyrus and consists of the Brodmann areas 1, 2, and 3.

### Sensory Transmission to the Brain

| |1. Neuron|2. Neuron|3. Neuron|Target Structure|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Mechanosensors, Muscle Spindles, Golgi Tendon Organ and Joint Sensors|- Spinal Ganglion|- Medulla Oblongata: Dorsal Column Nuclei<br>    - Nucleus Gracilis: Impulses from trunk and lower extremity<br>    - Nucleus Cuneatus: Impulses from Hand, arm and neck in the Medulla Oblongata<br>        - Axon of the 2nd Neuron crosses in the Medulla Oblongata|- Thalamus: The relay to the 3rd Neuron occurs in the Ventral Posterolateral Nucleus (VPL)|- Somatosensory Cortex|
|Thermosensors|- Hinterhorn<br>    - Axon of the 2nd neuron crosses segmentally in the anterior white commissure|

### Detailed Course of the Sensitive Track

#### Mechanosensors, Muscle Spindles, Golgi Tendon Organs and Joint Sensors

1. Entry into the Hinterhorn of the spinal cord
2. Course as background strands to the brainstem
    - Fasciculus gracilis (Fibers of the lower extremity)
    - Cuneate fasciculus (fibers of the upper extremity)
3. Switching to the 2nd neuron
4. Crossing to the other side
5. Course as medial lemniscus to the thalamus
6. Switchover to the 3rd neuron in the thalamus
7. Course from the thalamus through the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the somatosensory cortex

#### Thermosensors

2. Switching to the 2nd neuron in the dorsal horn
3. Segmental crossing in the anterior white commissure
4. Course as anterior front strand to the contralateral thalamus
5. Switchover to the 3rd neuron in the thalamus
6. Course from the thalamus through the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the somatosensory cortex

> [!NOTE] Friedreich's Ataxia  
> Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that usually occurs before the age of 25 and leads to a progressive degeneration of the dorsal columns. Clinically, it presents with reduced vibration sense and decreased two-point discrimination. Since proprioception is also affected, there is a disturbed recognition of executed movements and gait instability (gait ataxia). There is no causal therapy available, and the disease progresses continuously. Patients often become wheelchair-bound and frequently die prematurely from the consequences of comorbidities.

### Objective Measurement of Sensitive Sensations

With the help of somatosensory evoked potentials, the function of the entire somatosensory system from peripheral nerves to the somatosensory cortex can be assessed. This is an objective test of sensitivity that plays a role, for example, in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. To differentiate dysfunctions of the central sensory pathways from disorders of peripheral sensory nerves, recordings from multiple body sites are necessary. The interpretation is done with the help of a representation of the electrical excitation at the measurement electrodes.

- Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEP): Recording of the electrical summed action potentials of the nerve tissue along the sensory pathway after stimulation of a peripheral nerve.
    - Application: Examination of the sensitive pathway (e.g., in case of suspicion of Multiple Sclerosis)
    - Interpretation of the results
        - Latency delay: Demarcation of the nerves and thus reduced conduction speed
        - Reduced amplitude: Reduction in the number of nerve fibers (with intact myelin sheath)
    - Implementation using the example of N. tibialis
        - Electrical stimulation of the mechanosensors using an electrode at the level of the ankle joint
        - Transmission of the stimulus via the N. tibialis
        - Measurement of the sum action potentials on multiple levels (popliteal fossa, LWK 5, HWK 2)
        - Excitation of the primary somatosensory cortex
        - Derivation of the electric potential of the somatosensory cortex using EEG

> [!NOTE] Somatosensory Evoked Potentials in Multiple Sclerosis  
> In multiple sclerosis, there is demyelination of the nerve fibers in the central nervous system. As a result, electrical signals are transmitted more slowly (or not at all) through the affected and demyelinated nerve fibers. When an externally applied electrical stimulus is used to test the sensory pathway of a demyelinated nerve fiber, it transmits the electrical signal more slowly to the somatosensory cortex (compared to a "healthy" nerve). Therefore, in the somatosensory cortex, a somatosensory potential is triggered only after a corresponding delay (known as latency).

## Central Processing of Sensitive Information

### Somatosensory Cortex

The sensitive information of the body is transmitted via the thalamus to specific areas of the cortex (cerebral cortex. The information first reaches the primary somatosensory cortex, which registers the stimuli from peripheral sensors and assigns them, among other things, to body regions. Subsequently, the stimuli are forwarded to the secondary somatosensory cortex, which is responsible for their interpretation, among other things. The primary and secondary somatosensory cortex are located directly next to each other on the postcentral gyrus.

#### Primary Somatosensory Cortex

- Functions
    - Differentiation of the strength and type of stimulus
    - Assignment of stimulus localization
- Location: Postcentral gyrus (parietal cortex)
- Composition: Brodmann-Areas 1, 2, 3a and 3b
- Outline: Somatotopy (Sensory Homunculus)
    - Principle of Representation: The density of sensors in the periphery determines the size of the area of the somatosensory cortex responsible for a body part → The greater the sensor density, the larger the representation of the body part in the homunculus.
        - Important representation sites (from medial basal to lateral basal)
            - Mantle edge : Lower extremity, torso, neck, head
            - Apical Region: Upper Extremity
            - Basal area: Face, Jaw, Tongue, Throat, Abdominal organs
- Afferents from
    - Area 1: In particular, mechanosensors and information from areas 3a, 3b
    - Area 2: Proprioceptive information (especially joint sensors) and information from areas 1, 3a, and 3b
    - Area 3a: Proprioceptive information (especially muscle spindles)
    - Area 3b: In particular, afferents from pain and temperature sensors
- Differences to
    - Areas 1, 2, 3a, and 3b → Secondary somatosensory cortex

#### Secondary Somatosensory Cortex

- Functions
    - Interpretation of stimuli
    - Recognition of stimuli
- Location: Basal of the Postcentral gyrus
- Outline: Somatotopy
- Afferents from:
    - In particular, the primary somatosensory cortex
    - Thalamic fibers (significantly less than from the primary somatosensory cortex)
- Differences related to: Limbic structures (Amygdala, Hippocampus)
    - Amygdala: For emotional evaluation
    - Hippocampus: For tactile learning and tactile memory

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the secondary somatosensory cortex, there are other areas of the brain that are involved in the detection and interpretation of sensory information, such as the posterior parietal cortex!

> [!NOTE] Mantle edge syndrome
> Both hemispheres of the brain are rounded on their outer sides and bend vertically in the area of the interhemispheric fissure (longitudinal fissure of the cerebrum). This "edge" is referred to as the mantle edge, over which the sensory and motor area for the lower extremity extends. The arterial supply is provided by the A. cerebri anterior. If this artery is completely or partially occluded, sensory disturbances and loss of strength in the lower extremity as well as bladder dysfunction and fecal incontinence may occur. When all these symptoms occur together, it is referred to as a mantle edge syndrome.

> [!NOTE] Tactile Agnosia
> In the event of a failure of the secondary somatosensory cortex, conscious perception of touch and feeling is still possible through the primary somatosensory cortex, however, interpretation and association with memories no longer occur. What is felt is no longer recognized. This clinical picture is called tactile agnosia (tactile blindness) and can occur, for example, after a stroke in the parietal region of the brain.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Tactile System
### Taste and Touch Overview

Which modalities and sensory qualities of interoception do you know?
- In the perception of the body's interior, we distinguish between enterception and proprioception. Proprioception, also called deep sensitivity, includes information about the position of the body in space. Enteroception, also called visceroception, describes the perception of the internal organs.
### Sense of Taste

Explain the term Merkel cell axon complex!
- The afferent endings of the Merkel cells are also referred to as the Merkel cell-axon complex, because basally, a Merkel cell is often attached to an axon, with which it forms a synapse-like connection.
Which cells are particularly important for reading Braille? Why?
- When reading Braille, the form of the object must be identified above all. For this, a high spatial resolution as well as a very sensitive response to any deformation of the skin is necessary. These are both qualities of Merkel cells – Meissner corpuscles are activated by deformations.
What are Pacinian corpuscles? When are they activated?
- Vater-Pacini corpuscles surround the axon ending in an onion-like fashion with Schwann cells and a perineural capsule. They respond to vibration stimuli and have their activity maximum at 100–400 Hz.
What does the term "simultaneous spatial threshold" describe? Where in the body is it particularly low or high?
- Spatial threshold describes the distance that two mechanical skin stimuli must have to still be perceived as separate. If these stimuli are triggered simultaneously, it is called simultaneous spatial threshold. The lowest simultaneous spatial threshold is found at 1 mm at the tip of the tongue and 2 mm at the fingertip. The distance is particularly large on the back (approximately 54 mm).
### Temperature Sense

Where are the effectiveness maxima of cold and warm sensors?
- Cold sensors have their peak effectiveness between 20 and 30 °C. The activity of warm sensors is highest between 38–43 °C.
What sensitive quality do thermosensors have?
- Cold and warm receptors are proportional-differential sensors. They respond both to the absolute temperature and fire spontaneously according to its level, and they also respond to changes in temperature.
### Depth Sensitivity

Which sensor of proprioception is also innervated efferently?
- The intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles are innervated efferently by γ-motoneurons. Through this mechanism, they can also react in an already shortened and contracted muscle.
Through which afferent pathway is information about muscle tension transmitted?
- The Golgi tendon organ conveys information about muscle tension to the spinal cord via Ib afferents.
How is a muscle spindle structured?
- The spindle-shaped complex of muscle spindles consists of a collagen-like connective tissue sheath (called the "perineural capsule") that surrounds the intrafusal muscle fibers lying inside as well as the nerve fibers spirally wrapped around them.
### The Sensitive Train

Where are Ncl. cuneatus and Ncl. gracilis located? What impulses do they process?
- The dorsal column nuclei Ncl. cuneatus and Ncl. gracilis are located in the medulla oblongata.
- They process impulses of the sense of touch and proprioception. The Ncl. gracilis for the lower extremity and trunk, the Ncl. cuneatus for the upper extremity and neck.
What information is conveyed in the background strands?
- In the dorsal columns, information of the sense of touch and proprioception runs to the brainstem for switching to the 2nd neuron. The fasciculus gracilis contains fibers of the lower extremity, the fasciculus cuneatus fibers of the upper extremity.
Which fibers run in the medial lemniscus? Where do they switch next?
- In the medial lemniscus, the fibers of the dorsal column pathway (fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus), which have crossed in the 2nd neuron in the medulla oblongata, run together to the thalamus, where they switch to the 3rd neuron.
How is the course of the sensory pathway after switching in the thalamus?
- Both information from the sense of touch and proprioception as well as from temperature receptors run after switching to the 3rd neuron in the thalamus via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the somatosensory cortex.
Where does the switching to the 2nd neuron of sensory stimuli occur?
- Thermosensitive stimuli are already switched to the 2nd neuron in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and then run as the anterior tract to the thalamus. The other sensitive stimuli run without switching in the dorsal column and are only switched to the 2nd neuron in the medulla oblongata.
