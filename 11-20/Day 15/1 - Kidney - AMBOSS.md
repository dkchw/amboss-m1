# Kidney
## Summary

The kidney (Ren, Nephros) is a bean-shaped, paired organ located in the retroperitoneal space. Both kidneys are supplied with 20% of the cardiac output (1200 mL of blood) per minute, making them, in relation to their weight, the most vascularized organs. Macroscopically, the kidney is divided into cortex and medulla. Microscopically, the kidney consists of approximately 1 million functional units, the nephrons, which in turn are made up of renal corpuscles along with the glomerular filtration barrier and the tubular system. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the kidney in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the kidney.

The kidneys produce urine and have a very important function in the excretion of substances that are excreted via urine. Furthermore, they are involved in the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and thus influence blood pressure and blood volume. Through various buffer systems, they adjust the body's acid-base balance. In the kidneys, among other things, the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) is produced, which stimulates the formation of erythrocytes, as well as activating vitamin D3, which is necessary for bone metabolism. This chapter deals with the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of the kidneys and provides an overview of their functions. Some of the functions are discussed in detail in other chapters, which are referenced in this context.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

The bean-shaped kidneys are located retroperitoneally in the so-called kidney bed, a niche formed by the quadratus lumborum and psoas major muscles. They are macroscopically divided into renal cortex and medulla. The arterial and venous supply is provided by the renal artery and vein.

### Profile

- Shape: Bean-shaped
- Size: 10–12 cm long, 5–6 cm wide, and 3–4 cm thick
- Weight: Each 150–180 g
- Areas and Edges
    - Front and back surface: Slightly curved outward
    - Page margins
        - Medial: Concave
        - Lateral: Convex

### Structure

In the macroscopic structure of the kidney, a distinction is made between the renal parenchyma and the renal pelvis and calyces system. It is surrounded by a tough connective tissue capsule, which is part of the three-layered renal covering.

#### Kidney Parenchyma

In the renal parenchyma, various layers can be macroscopically distinguished from one another, which, however, form a functional unit.

- Renal cortex (Cortex renalis)
    - approx. 1 cm thick layer directly under the kidney capsule
    - Contains glomeruli and renal vessels
    - From the bark, columns extend into the renal medulla (Columnae renales)
- Renal medulla (Medulla renalis)
    - Here are mainly the tubular system and the collecting ducts.
    - Consists of 7–12 renal pyramids (pyramides renales), which point with their base towards the cortical parenchyma and terminate with their apex in the minor calyces (calices renales minores)
    - Is histologically divided into outer renal medulla and inner renal medulla

#### Renal pelvis and calyces system (RPCS)

The NBKS collects the urine from the renal pyramids and directs it caudally into the ureter. It consists of the minor calyces, which converge into two to three major calyces, which in turn lead into the renal pelvis (Pelvis renalis).

- Small renal calyces (Calices renales minores)
    - Collect the urine that is exiting from the papillae of the renal pyramids
    - Prevent the passage of urine into the renal parenchyma
- Major calyces (Calices renales majores): Connection between minor calyces and renal pelvis
- Renal pelvis: Connection between the major calyces and the ureter

> [!NOTE] Pyelonephritis
> In the case of a bacterial infection of the urinary tract (e.g. bladder infection), the infection can ascend if therapeutic measures are not taken in a timely manner. Subsequently, the renal pelvis first becomes inflamed, followed by the renal parenchyma. A so-called pyelonephritis leads to symptoms such as flank pain, nausea, and chills. The most dangerous complication of such pyelonephritis is the so-called urosepsis: Here, the causative germs enter the bloodstream and can lead to a systemic immune reaction with fatal consequences.

### Topography

The kidneys are primarily retroperitoneal along the spine.

- Left Kidney
    - Upper pole: At the height of BWK 12
    - Lower pole: At the level of LWK 2–3
- Right kidney: Located approximately ½ vertebral body caudal to the left kidney due to the cranial boundary with the liver.

#### Kidney Capsules

The kidney is surrounded by a three-layered sheath (from the inside out):

1. Renal capsule (Capsula fibrosa renis): Capsule made of dense collagenous connective tissue
2. Renal fat capsule (Capsula adiposa renis): Loose fat capsule that surrounds the kidneys and adrenal glands.
    - Especially lateral and dorsal to the kidney
3. Renal fascia (Fascia renalis, Gerota's fascia): Fascia made of dense collagenous connective tissue.
    - Medial and caudal, the fascia sac of the kidney is split open; here, the blood vessels and the ureter exit the kidney.
        - Thicker retrorenal sheet: Partially fused with the fascia transversalis on the dorsal wall of the trunk
        - Thinner pre-renal layer: Partially fused with the parietal peritoneum

> [!NOTE]
> The renal fascia is shiftable in relation to the surrounding tissue, just like the kidney within its fat capsule!

> [!NOTE] Flank pain
> Due to inflammation or a urinary flow obstruction, swelling of the kidney may occur. If this is pronounced, the stretching of the sensitively innervated renal capsule (Capsula fibrosa renis) leads to severe flank pain.

### Renal Pathways

The arterial supply of the kidney is provided by the renal arteries, which branch directly from the aorta. The venous drainage occurs through the similarly named renal veins, which drain into the inferior vena cava.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. renal from abdominal aorta|
|Venous|- Renal vein in inferior vena cava|
|Lymph drainage|   |
|Regional Lymph Stations|- Right and left lumbar lymph nodes: They are divided into groups depending on the side<br>    - Lateral aortic lymph nodes (left)<br>    - Postcaval lymph nodes (right)<br>- They direct lymph to the right or left lumbar trunk|
|Innervation|   |
|Vegetative|- Renal plexus from the minor splanchnic nerve and lumbar nerves (Sympathetic) or the posterior vagus trunk (Parasympathetic)|

> [!NOTE]
> From its departure from the abdominal aorta, the right renal artery runs along behind the inferior vena cava, while the left one goes directly to the renal hilum – in the case of the veins, it is the opposite: the right renal vein goes directly to the inferior vena cava, while the left renal vein runs in front of the abdominal aorta!

#### Anatomical Features of the Conducting Pathways

- Exit of the renal vessels at the renal hilum (Hilus renalis): From ventral to dorsal: V. renalis → A. renalis → Ureter (dorsocaudal)
- Course of the right renal artery: The right renal artery runs behind the inferior vena cava.
- Course of the left renal vein: The left renal vein runs in front of the abdominal aorta and behind the superior mesenteric artery.
- Left renal vein
    - About 5 cm longer than the right vein
    - Also takes blood from the left testicular vein or ovarian vein.

> [!NOTE] Varicocele
> The left V. testicularis drains almost perpendicularly into the left renal vein. Due to this unfavorable drainage angle, there can be a venous congestion extending into the pampiniform plexus, which becomes significantly enlarged as a result. This leads to a painless enlargement of the left testicle, referred to as a "varicocele." However, one must always consider the possibility of a testicular tumor with this symptom constellation!

> [!NOTE] Nutcracker syndrome
> The left renal vein is located in an arterial vessel clamp between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, similar to a nut in a nutcracker. Anatomical variants (e.g., a left renal vein that ascends particularly high), as well as pathophysiologies (e.g., a compressing pancreatic tumor), can lead to the vein being trapped between the two arteries: Blood cannot drain further and backs up into the testicular vein (♂) or the ovarian vein (♀). In men, this manifests as a painless enlargement of the left testicle (varicocele), while in women, it presents as lower abdominal pain caused by the dilations of the ovarian vein.

## Microscopic Anatomy

Microscopically, the kidney is composed of approximately 1 million functional units, known as nephrons. A nephron consists of the renal corpuscle with the glomerular filtration barrier as well as the renal tubular system. The renal tubular system then connects to the renal pelvis calyx system (RPCS) via the collecting ducts.

### Renal Corpuscle (Corpusculum renale)

The renal corpuscles connect the vascular system with the tubular system and form the primary urine through ultrafiltration of the blood. The renal corpuscles are mainly located in the renal cortex (cortical), partly also directly beneath the renal capsule (capsular) or near the renal medulla (juxtamedullary). They consist of three components.

#### Glomerulus

- Twisted vessel ball
    - Consists of three sections following the flow of blood
        1. Afferent arteriole (Afferent glomerular arteriole): Delivers blood for filtration into the capillaries.
        2. Curved capillary with fenestrated capillary endothelium and glomerular basement membrane (GBM): Here, blood filtration and primary urine production take place.
        3. Efferent vessel (Afferent glomerular arteriola): Conducts blood from the capillary to the vasa recta (countercurrent principle)
- Intraglomerular mesangial cells

#### Bowman-Kapsel

- Takes the filtered primary urine between its leaves and directs it into the tubule system at the so-called urinary pole.
    - Visceral (inner) layer
        - Is directly adjacent to the glomerulus
        - Formed by podocytes and is part of the glomerular filtration barrier.
    - Capsule space (urinary space): Lies between the two layers
    - Parietal (outer) leaf
        - Simple flat squamous epithelium
        - Limits the capsule space towards the renal parenchyma

#### Juxtaglomerular Apparatus (JGA)

- Cell group that lies adjacent to the vascular pole of the glomerulus and takes on regulatory functions.
    - Extraglomerular mesangial cells: Possibly involved in the regulation of kidney blood flow.
    - Juxtaglomerular cells (= granular cells): Smooth muscle cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole, also known as "polkissen cells."
        - Produces renin to regulate blood pressure and electrolyte balance (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system)
    - Macula densa
        - Epithelial area within the distal nephron; located where the distal tubule touches the afferent arteriole.
        - Measure the NaCl concentration in the urine of the distal tubule.
#### Glomerular Filtration Barrier

The glomerular urine filter is three-layered and forms the blood-urine barrier. Water and the substances dissolved in it are allowed to pass through this filter, while plasma proteins and blood cells are retained.

### Renal Tubules (Tubuli renales)

The renal tubular system has a direct connection to the renal corpuscle via the urinary pole and is responsible for concentrating the filtered primary urine, resulting in the final urine produced by the collecting ducts. The tubular system is divided into five sections. The renal cortex is defined as the area where all glomeruli and all convoluted parts of the proximal and distal tubules are located. The outer zone of the renal medulla is the area where the straight parts of the proximal tubules begin. The transition from the proximal tubules to the intermediate tubule separates the outer stripe from the inner stripe of the outer zone. Similarly, the transition from the intermediate to the distal tubule marks the boundary between the inner stripe and the inner zone.

#### Structure of the Tubular System

- Flow of urine: Capsule space (primary urine) → Proximal tubule (convoluted part) → Proximal tubule (straight part) → Intermediate tubule (descending part and possibly ascending part) → Distal tubule (straight part) → Distal tubule (convoluted part) → Connecting tubule → Collecting duct (secondary urine)

#### Assignment of Parenchyma Area and Tubule Section

The renal parenchyma is divided from the outside in into the renal cortex, outer medulla (with the outer and inner stripes), and inner medulla. The tubular sections can be assigned to the individual parenchymal areas.

- Renal cortex
    - Content: Renal corpuscles + all convoluted parts of the proximal and distal tubule as well as sections of some collecting ducts
    - Border to the outer strip: Transition from the winding to the straight sections of the proximal tubule
- Outer renal medulla
    - Outer stripe of the outer renal medulla
        - Content: Straight segments of the proximal and distal tubules + collecting ducts
        - Border to the inner stripe: Transition of the straight segments of the proximal tubules into the intermediate tubules
    - Inner stripe of the outer renal medulla
        - Content: Intermediate tubules + straight portions (Pars recta) of the distal tubules + collecting ducts
        - Boundary to the inner market: Transition of the intermediate tubules into straight segments of the distal tubules
- Inner renal medulla
    - Content: Intermediate tubules (also known as the thin segment of the Henle loop) + collecting ducts

#### Henle's Loop

- Contained tubule sections
    1. Straight part of the proximal tubule
    2. Intermediate tubule
    3. Straight part of the distal tubule
- Function: Urine concentration (see also: Urine concentration in the Henle loop)

> [!NOTE]
> Often, the intermediate tubule is mistakenly referred to as the Henle loop. However, this also includes the pars recta of the proximal and distal tubules!

## Functions of the Kidney at a Glance

The kidney performs a variety of functions in the body. The primary focus is the elimination of waste substances and the regulation of electrolyte, water, and acid-base balance.

- Function of the kidney
    - Excretion of nitrogenous substances
        - Production of primary and final urine (see: Kidney - Transport and filtration processes)
    - Regulation of electrolyte and water balance
    - Regulation of acid-base balance (see: The role of the kidney in pH regulation)
    - Important influence on blood pressure and blood volume
    - Formation of hormones (Erythropoietin, Calcitriol)
    - Metabolic processes (gluconeogenesis)
## Metabolic Pathways and Hormone Formation

The kidney has important functions for metabolism and hormone balance. On one hand, gluconeogenesis takes place here, and on the other hand, two important hormones are produced: erythropoietin, which is essential for blood formation, and calcitriol, which plays a significant role in bone metabolism.

### Metabolism: Gluconeogenesis

The gluconeogenesis mainly takes place in the liver, but to a lesser extent also in the kidney (for more detailed information about the mechanism see also: gluconeogenesis). For this purpose, the kidney uses the glucogenic amino acids glutamine and glutamate. To meet the high demand for ATP, energy is gained (especially in the cells of the proximal tubule) through the oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies.

### Hormone Production

#### Erythropoietin (EPO)

- Substance class: Glycoprotein
- Synthesis site: Predominantly in the kidney, to a lesser extent also in the hepatocytes
- Regulation
    - Increased release in anemia and oxygen deficiency in tissues (hypoxia)
    - Induction by the transcription factor HIF (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor)
- Function: Promotion of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow

> [!NOTE] Doping with EPO
> Natural Doping/Altitude Training: At high altitudes, the low partial pressure of oxygen during intense performance training leads to hypoxia. This results in an increased release of erythropoietin via the transcription factor HIF. Consequently, this leads to an increased erythropoiesis in the bones and thus a higher proportion of red blood cells in the blood (hematocrit). Athletes take advantage of this effect by training at high altitudes.
> Illegal doping: The injection of recombinant erythropoietin significantly increases hematocrit. This is used to enhance performance in competitive sports. In contrast to altitude training, this measure constitutes illegal doping. However, since blood tests cannot distinguish the administration of EPO from altitude training, a hematocrit value is defined that the athlete must not exceed (mainly to avoid health risks).

> [!NOTE] Renal Anemia
> With a long-term impairment of kidney function – a so-called chronic kidney insufficiency – erythropoietin is also produced in reduced amounts. As a result, blood formation in the bone marrow is insufficiently stimulated, leading to a deficiency of erythrocytes – a so-called anemia. Anemia typically manifests through signs such as fatigue, pallor, or rapid heartbeat.

#### Calcitriol (1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol = 1,25-(OH)2-VitaminD3)

The final step of calcitriol synthesis occurs in the kidney. The activation of vitamin D takes place in various structures of the body and is addressed in another chapter (for more information see: calciferol).
## Development

The paired urinary organs develop from the intermediate mesoderm, on both sides in the dorsal section of the body cavity. Embryonic development occurs in three consecutive developmental stages that proceed from cranial to caudal.

1. Pronephros
    - Meaning: Regresses without functional activity
    - Start: End of the 3rd week
    - Location: Neck area
2. Kidney (Mesonephros)
    - Meaning: Initially takes on a urine-forming function, but then regresses to the ureteric duct (Ductus mesonephricus = Wolff duct) and the pronephric tubules.
    - Period: Week 4–6
    - Location: Thoracic and lumbar region
    - Emerging structures
        - From the Wolffian duct of the primordial kidney arise: epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles
        - From the renal tubules arise: testicular efferent ducts (Ductuli efferentes testis)
3. Metanephros (Kidney)
    - Meaning: Formation of the functional kidney
    - Start: From the 5th embryonic week
    - Location: Abdominal and pelvic area
    - Process
        - Ureteric bud: Originates from the embryonic kidney duct (Wolff's duct) and induces nephron formation → The collecting duct is covered by a blastema cap.
            - The ureteric bud gives rise to the ureters, renal pelvis, renal calyces, ducts of the renal papillae, and collecting ducts with connecting pieces.
        - Blastema cap: Cells of the blastema cap form laterally of the collecting duct into a nephric vesicle (a blastema refers in embryology to a condensation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that serves as the starting structure for differentiated organs) → A nephron tubule develops through length growth
            - Distal, it connects to the collector pipe.
            - The proximal end expands into the Bowman capsule and connects to a capillary tuft.
        - Primitive kidney tubules: Forms the functional nephron for the production of primary and final urine through further length growth and differentiation.

> [!NOTE]
> The functional kidney "ascends" from its place of development in the lower abdominal cavity to its later final position beneath the diaphragm by reducing the curvature of the body and increasing growth in the lumbosacral area!

> [!NOTE] Potter sequence
> During pregnancy, different causes can lead to the development of oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid deficiency): A renal agenesis, for example, refers to the absence of one or both kidneys, resulting in insufficient urine production and thus causing oligohydramnios. This compresses the fetus and can lead to numerous malformations, such as pulmonary hypoplasia, facial changes, and limb deformities. These developments are referred to as Potter's sequence.

## Review Questions for the Kidney Chapter
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Describe the structure of the three-layered renal capsule from the inside out!
- The kidneys are each covered by a thin, dense connective tissue capsule, the capsula fibrosa. A loose fat capsule, the capsula adiposa, surrounds the kidneys and adrenal glands and serves as padding. Finally, the dense, connective tissue renal fascia (fascia renalis, Gerota's fascia) envelops all the aforementioned structures.

### Microscopic Anatomy

Describe the structure of the Bowman capsule!
- The Bowman capsule consists of an inner and an outer layer with a capsule space in between. The visceral (inner) layer lies against the glomerulus and is formed by podocytes; the podocyte processes here are part of the glomerular filtration barrier (the so-called slit diaphragm). The parietal (outer) layer consists of a single layer of flat squamous epithelium and borders the capsule space toward the renal parenchyma.

Where is the so-called macula densa located and what is its function?
- The macula densa ("dense spot") is an epithelial region in the ascending limb of the distal tubule, which lies directly adjacent to the glomerulus. It can detect changes in tubular flow rate by measuring the NaCl concentration in the urine and is thus part of the so-called juxtaglomerular apparatus, which is responsible for regulating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the individual nephron.

From which parts of the tubular system does the loop of Henle consist?
- The loop of Henle consists of the pars recta of the proximal tubule, the entire intermediate tubule, and the pars recta of the distal tubule.

The renal parenchyma is divided from the outside to the inside into the renal cortex, outer medulla (with outer and inner stripes), and inner medulla. Which components of the tubular system can be found in each of these parenchymal areas?
- The tubular system is arranged according to a strict pattern in the renal parenchyma. In the renal cortex are found renal corpuscles and all convoluted parts of the proximal and distal tubules. The straight parts of the distal tubules lie completely in the outer medulla; its outer stripe also contains the straight parts of the proximal tubules, and its inner stripe contains the intermediate tubules. Intermediate tubules are also located in the inner medulla. The collecting ducts run from the outer medulla through the inner medulla to the papilla.

How do the cells of the intermediate tubule appear histologically?
- The intermediate tubule forms the thin part of the loop of Henle and appears under the microscope as flat epithelium with a flattened cell nucleus. As a result, it has some similarity in cross-section to capillaries.

How is the distal tubule represented histologically? Which enzyme is particularly strongly expressed in this nephron segment?
- The distal tubule appears under the light microscope with a single layer of isoprismatic epithelium and round cell nuclei. At the apical cell membrane, unlike in the proximal tubule, there is no brush border visible here because the microvilli in the distal tubule are significantly shorter. The basolateral membrane incorporates increased amounts of the enzyme Na+/K+-ATPase. The distal tubule has the highest Na+/K+-ATPase activity compared to other nephron segments, which, combined with water-impermeable tight junctions, results in the urine being hypotonic in this segment.

### Functions of the Kidney at a Glance

What is the main energy source of the cells of the proximal renal tubule?
- Due to the tubular transport processes, the kidney has a high ATP requirement. The epithelial cells of the proximal tubule cannot generate energy by anaerobic glycolysis; they meet their demand exclusively aerobically through oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids and ketone bodies.

A small part of gluconeogenesis also takes place in the kidney. Which amino acids are used as starting substrates for this?
- Gluconeogenesis occurs primarily in the liver, but to a small extent also in the kidney (especially in the proximal tubule). The kidney uses the glucogenic amino acids glutamine and glutamate for this purpose.

### Development

The embryonic development of the kidney occurs in three consecutive developmental stages (pronephros, mesonephros, metanephros). To which stage are the Wolffian duct and ureteric bud each assigned?
- The kidney develops in three consecutive stages: the pronephros forms and regresses without function; from the subsequently developing mesonephros only the Wolffian duct (also called mesonephric duct) and mesonephric tubules remain. In the metanephros stage, the ureteric bud arises from the Wolffian duct and induces formation of the functional nephron.
