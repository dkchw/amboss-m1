# Meninges, Liquor Spaces, and Blood-Brain Barrier
## Summary

The brain and spinal cord are surrounded by the three meninges: dura mater, arachnoidea mater, and pia mater. These connective tissue layers secure, protect, and supply the CNS and maintain its shape. The three meninges are partly fused together or separated by cavities. The subarachnoid space between the arachnoidea mater and pia mater is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. For diagnostic (and therapeutic) purposes, this can be punctured in the lumbar area. The cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexus of the inner liquor space and is completely replaced approximately three times a day; its reabsorption occurs in the Pacchioni granulations and at the spinal roots. The main function of the cerebrospinal fluid is to protect the brain from shocks and other mechanical forces.

The brain also has a special protective barrier: the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It prevents harmful substances from crossing from the blood into the brain tissue. Nutrients, on the other hand, can pass through the BBB and thus ensure an adequate supply to the brain.
## The Opinion

Brain and spinal cord are surrounded by membranes that are also called meninges. These membranes support, protect, and nourish the CNS and maintain its shape. There are hard and soft brain and spinal membranes. While they have a similar structure, they possess some different properties.

### Overview of Meninges

#### Hard brain-/spinal meninges (Pachymeninx, dura mater of the brain/spinal cord)

- Stratum periostale: Outer dura mater layer
    - It is closely adherent to the skull bone or the wall of the spinal canal and can also be fused with them.
    - Consists of dense, fibrous connective tissue
- Meningeal stratum: Inner dural layer
    - Is the arachnoid mater present
    - Also consists of tight, fiber-rich connective tissue
    - Durasepten: Duplicate of the inner Durablatt
        - Falx cerebri: Runs between the cerebral hemispheres
        - Falx cerebelli: Runs between the cerebellar hemispheres
        - Tentorium cerebelli: Runs between the cerebrum and cerebellum

#### Soft brain and/or spinal meninges (leptomeninx)

- Arachnoid mater (Arachnoid, arachnoid membrane)
    - Is the Dura mater located internally
    - Consists of loose connective tissue and is almost transparent
    - Has a web-like appearance due to fine connective tissue projections (trabeculae arachnoideae)
- Pia mater
    - Is the surface of the CNS - the membrana gliae limitans superficialis - firmly attached
    - Covers all sulci and fissures as well
    - Virchow-Robin spaces: The pia mater also partially surrounds the vessels that enter the CNS, resulting in funnel-shaped cavities.

#### Innervation of the Meninges

It is assumed that the brain itself is not sensorily innervated, while the injury to the meninges is perceived as very painful.

- Opinion of the Brain
    - N. trigeminus: Frontal and parietal parts of the meninges
    - N. vagus and N. glossopharyngeus: Occipital components of the meninges
- Opinion of the Spinal Cord
    - Meningeal branches of the spinal nerves

#### Blood supply of the meninges

The blood supply of the meninges is primarily provided by the A. meningea media, a branch of the A. maxillaris.

- A. meningea media from A. maxillaris: Supplies the majority of the meninges and the skull cap.
- Meningeal branches of the anterior ethmoidal artery: Supply of the anterior cranial fossa
- A. meningea posterior from A. pharyngea ascendens and branches from A. occipitalis and A. vertebralis: supply of the posterior cranial fossa

### Interspaces of the Meninges in Spinal Cord and Brain

Between Pia and Arachnoidea mater lies the cerebrospinal fluid-filled subarachnoid space. In the case of the spinal cord, the Arachnoidea mater is adhered to the meningeal layer of the dura mater, while in the case of the brain, the two layers are merely in contact but can be separated by, for example, a hemorrhage - leading to the formation of a subdural space. Conversely, in the case of the brain, both layers of the dura are firmly fused, while in the case of the spinal cord, the epidural space lies in between.

| |Spinal Cord<br><br>(Meninges of the spinal cord)|Brain<br><br>(Meninges of the brain)|
|---|---|---|
|Pia mater|   |   |
|Subarachnoid space|- Filled with cerebrospinal fluid (so-called external cerebrospinal space)<br>- Contains the cauda equina<br>- Contains the roots of the spinal nerves<br>- Puncture space for lumbar puncture|- Traversed by web-like connective tissue septa of the arachnoidea<br>- Contains the extracerebral blood vessels of the CNS<br>- Filled with cerebrospinal fluid (so-called external cerebrospinal space)|
|Arachnoidea mater|   |   |
|Subdural space|- Not present|- Only present in the context of pathologies|
|Dura mater (Meningeal layer and periosteal layer)|   |   |
|Epidural space|- Present<br>    - Contains adipose tissue, a venous plexus, and (over a short distance) spinal nerves|- Present only in the context of pathologies|
> [!NOTE] Epidural hematoma
> The epidural space in the brain normally exists only theoretically, as the dura mater and the skull bones are firmly fused together. However, in the case of a severe skull-brain trauma, there can be a rupture of the middle meningeal artery, which runs directly beneath the skull bone. The blood can then enter between the dura mater and the skull bone and form a hematoma in the now created epidural space (so-called epidural hematoma).

> [!NOTE] Subdural hematoma  
> A bleeding in the subdural space is often caused by a rupture of the bridging veins between the dura mater and arachnoid. The bridging veins connect the superficial cerebral veins with the dural sinuses. After a cranio-cerebral trauma, the subdural hematoma can develop acutely, while after a minor trauma, it may take a chronic course (often over weeks) and often manifests through nonspecific neurological symptoms.

> [!NOTE] Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
> The subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and the pia mater houses the blood vessels of the CNS. A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is often the result of a rupture of a aneurysm of the basilar arteries.

## Liquorsystem

Liquor (also known as nerve or cerebrospinal fluid) is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.

### Profile Liquor

- Function
    - Protective function: Cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space protects the CNS from mechanical forces.
    - Transport of waste products, maintenance of the chemical environment
    - Weight reduction of the brain
    - Supply of the CNS with ions and vitamins (e.g. Vitamin C and folic acid) [1]
- Volume: 100–160 mL
- Composition: Clear, colorless liquid with low cell content
    - Cell count: <4/μL
    - Lactate: 1.2–2.1 mmol/L
    - Proteins (mainly Albumin): 15–45 mg/dL
    - Glucose: 40–75 mg/dL

> [!NOTE]
> Among the dissolved substances, the proteins, such as albumin, have the highest quotient of concentration in blood plasma and concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (it is about 100:1)!

### Liquor Circulation

- The outer cerebrospinal fluid space and the inner cerebrospinal fluid space together account for a volume of 100–160 mL of cerebrospinal fluid
- The liquor is completely replaced about three times a day (every 6–8 hours).

#### Liquor Formation

The liquor is produced by the choroid plexuses, which are located in the inner liquor space.

- Choroid plexus: A network of vascular tissue in the internal cerebrospinal fluid space that produces cerebrospinal fluid from blood plasma.
    - Components
        - Choroid plexus: Connective tissue framework of the plexus, arises from a duplication of the Pia mater
        - Ependymal cells: Cover the choroid plexus
    - Occurrence: Parts of the lateral ventricles (central part and inferior horn), III. ventricle, IV. ventricle

> [!NOTE]
> In the anterior horn and posterior horn of the lateral ventricles, there are no choroid plexuses!

#### Liquor Resorption

The liquor resorption occurs partly through the arachnoid granulations in the subarachnoid space of the brain, but the majority is absorbed in the area of the spinal cord through outpouchings in the area of the spinal nerves.

- Arachnoid granulations (Pacchioni granulations)
    - Avascular protrusions of the arachnoid in the superior sagittal sinus
    - Can extend to the diploic veins (Venae diploicae) in the skullcap and are visible there as Foveolae granulares
- Cysts of the subarachnoid space around the spinal roots
    - Resorption through the venous plexus of the spine and lymphatic vessels
    - Main drainage pathway of the liquor

> [!NOTE] Hydrocephalus
> A drainage disorder or an overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid leads to a pathological expansion of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. This clinical picture is referred to as hydrocephalus (from Greek hydro = "water" and kephalos = "head"). If the expansion capacity of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces is exhausted, the affected individuals may experience an increase in intracranial pressure and typical signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g., headaches, nausea, vomiting, coma).

> [!NOTE] Liquordiagnostik
> For diagnostic purposes, the cerebrospinal fluid can be punctured. Here, the assessment of the color and transparency of the cerebrospinal fluid can already provide an initial indication of a disease: A turbidity of the cerebrospinal fluid suggests an inflammation of the brain tissue or the meninges, whereas the presence of blood may indicate a rupture of blood vessels or a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

## Liquor Rooms

The outer and inner liquor spaces are distinguished, in which the liquor circulates. Both spaces are connected via the fourth ventricle. The formation of liquor occurs in the inner liquor space, while the resorption takes place in the outer liquor space.

### External Liquor Space

- Subarachnoid space (Spatium subarachnoideum): Surrounded by the soft meninges (Arachnoid mater and Pia mater)
    - Cisterns: Extensions of the subarachnoid space

            - Liquor collection site for liquor punctures in pediatric special cases
            - It is located dorsal to the medulla oblongata in the brainstem

### Inner Liquor Space

The internal cerebrospinal fluid space consists of the four brain ventricles (two lateral ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle), the aqueduct of the midbrain, and the central canal (central canal) of the spinal cord. The internal cerebrospinal fluid space is lined by specialized glial cells of the CNS - the so-called ependymal cells. These cells act as a separating layer between cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue, but they are permeable to most molecules, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to freely diffuse into the brain tissue. At their tips, the ependymal cells have motile cell extensions, known as cilia, that transport the cerebrospinal fluid. The internal cerebrospinal fluid space is in contact with the external cerebrospinal fluid space - the subarachnoid space - only through the fourth ventricle.

### Liquor flow

Driving forces for the cerebrospinal fluid are the secretion pressure of the choroid plexuses and the ependymal cells, whose cilia move the cerebrospinal fluid.

1. I. and II. Ventricle: Cerebrospinal fluid flows through the interventricular foramina into the III. Ventricle
2. III. Ventricle: Cerebrospinal fluid flows through the cerebral aqueduct into the IV. Ventricle
3. IV. Ventricle: Here, the cerebrospinal fluid of the inner cerebrospinal fluid space is collected.
4. Lateral apertures and median aperture: The cerebrospinal fluid flows through the openings in the IV. Ventricle from the inner to the outer cerebrospinal fluid space
5. Subarachnoid space: Further circulation in the cisterns of the subarachnoid space
## Blood-Brain Barrier

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important physiological protective barrier for the brain and prevents harmful substances from crossing from the blood into the brain tissue. The size and ionic charge of a substance are crucial for determining whether it can pass through the BBB. At the same time, the BBB is permeable to important nutrients like glucose, ensuring the adequate supply of the brain.

### Histological Structure

The blood-brain barrier has the following components when viewed from the blood to the brain:

- Capillary endothelium
    - Formed by tight junctions between the endothelial cells of the brain vessels
    - Actual diffusion barrier of the BHS
- Basement membrane: Protein layer that completely surrounds the endothelial layer of the vessel.
- Pericytes
    - Are not directly involved in the barrier function of the BHS, but influence the permeability of the endothelium and vascular tone.
    - Special feature in the brain: Ability for phagocytosis
- Astrocyte processes
    - Are not directly involved in the barrier function of the BHS, but influence the permeability of the endothelia by releasing signaling molecules.

### Function

- Barrier: The blood-brain barrier is impermeable to many harmful substances and medications.
    - It holds true that the more lipophilic and smaller a molecule is, the more likely it can cross the blood-brain barrier
    - Specific transporters and channels regulate the uptake and release of many substances.
- Supply of the brain with glucose
- Maintenance of homeostasis
- Excretion of metabolic waste products

### Circumventricular Organs

For certain areas in the brain, a direct connection to the bloodstream is necessary for material exchange, which is why the blood-brain barrier is often either more permeable or even nonexistent here. This primarily concerns areas near the third ventricle and fourth ventricle (so-called circumventricular organs).

- Area postrema
- Neurohypophysis
- Epiphysis
- Choroid plexus
- Median eminence
- Subfornical organ
- Organum vasculosum of the terminal lamina
- Subcommissural organ

> [!NOTE] Barrier malfunction
> The term "blood-brain barrier disruption" refers to a condition in which the blood-brain barrier is either not permeable at all or becomes increasingly permeable to certain substances. Causes of this can include a traumatic brain injury or other injuries, as well as poisoning, inflammation, or space-occupying lesions.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Meningen, Cerebrospinal Fluid Spaces, and Blood-Brain Barrier
### Meninges

Name the various membranes surrounding the brain! What intervening spaces can be distinguished?
- The brain is surrounded by three meninges. From outside to inside, these are: dura mater (hard meningeal layer), arachnoidea mater, and pia mater (the latter two are collectively referred to as the soft meningeal layer). The dura mater is firmly fused with the skull bone, so that the intervening epidural space normally does not exist physiologically. Also, the subdural space between the dura mater and arachnoidea mater, lying inward, is not present in healthy individuals. Only through bleeding between the skull bone and the dura mater can an epidural space be created, while bleeding between the dura mater and arachnoidea mater can lead to the formation of a subdural space. The third and innermost subarachnoid space, in contrast, is a physiologically existing space between arachnoidea mater and pia mater. Since cerebrospinal fluid circulates in it, it is also referred to as the outer cerebrospinal fluid space.

What is meant by a subdural hematoma, what is its most common cause, and how does it clinically manifest?
- A subdural hemorrhage (= subdural hematoma) refers to bleeding into the physiologically non-existent subdural space (between dura mater and arachnoidea mater). The most common cause of a subdural hemorrhage is a rupture of the bridging veins triggered by a traumatic brain injury. These veins connect the superficial cerebral veins with the dural sinuses and must cross both arachnoidea and dura mater for this. Since it is a venous bleeding, and thus the hematoma usually increases slowly because of the low venous blood pressure, symptoms (such as headaches, confusion, consciousness disturbances, or neurological deficits) can appear only days to several weeks after the triggering event (the so-called subacute or chronic subdural hemorrhage). However, in the case of a severe traumatic brain injury, there can also be an acute form of subdural hemorrhage, in which symptoms occur without delay.

What is meant by an epidural hemorrhage and how does it occur?
- An epidural hemorrhage (= epidural hematoma) means bleeding into the physiologically non-existent epidural space between the dura mater and the skull bone. These two structures are normally firmly fused but can be separated in the context of a rupture of the middle meningeal artery that runs directly beneath the skull bone. The most common cause of such a rupture is a severe traumatic brain injury.

### Liquor System

What is meant by the outer cerebrospinal fluid space?
- The subarachnoid space is also called the outer cerebrospinal fluid space. This physiologically existing space between arachnoidea mater and pia mater surrounds the brain as well as the spinal cord. The subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid and, in the region of the spinal cord, the roots (radices) of the spinal nerves and the cauda equina.

What is the essential difference in the composition of cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma in healthy individuals?
- Due to diffusion barriers between blood and cerebrospinal fluid, larger molecules circulating in the blood, such as proteins, enter the cerebrospinal fluid only to a small extent. Therefore, its protein concentration of 15–45 mg/dL is significantly lower than the protein concentration of blood plasma (6000–8000 mg/dL = 60–80 g/L).

What is meant by the inner liquor space?
- The inner liquor space consists of the four interconnected brain ventricles (two lateral ventricles and the third and fourth ventricles) and the central canal (canalis centralis) of the spinal cord. The two interventricular foramina (foramina of Monro) connect the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle, which in turn has a connection via the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of midbrain) to the fourth ventricle. The two lateral apertures (foramina of Luschka) and the median aperture (foramen of Magendie) of the fourth ventricle form a connection from the inner to outer cerebrospinal fluid space (= subarachnoid space).

Where is the liquor formed?
- Cerebrospinal fluid is produced in the choroid plexuses. These networks of vascular-rich tissue are located in certain parts of all four ventricles. Specifically, these are the pars centralis and the inferior horn of each lateral ventricle (there are no choroid plexuses in the anterior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricles!), the roof of the third ventricle (tela choroidea), and the posterior wall of the fourth ventricle.

What is meant by the rhomboid fossa?
- The rhomboid fossa (fossa rhomboidea), formed by the dorsal surfaces of the pons and medulla oblongata, constitutes the ventral boundary of the fourth ventricle. Its widest point lies at the level of the vestibular area.

Where can a medical withdrawal of liquor take place?
- A cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal may be necessary for numerous diagnostic as well as therapeutic reasons. As a rule, the subarachnoid space is punctured caudal to the third lumbar vertebra. Because the conus medullaris of the spinal cord ends approximately at the level of lumbar vertebrae 1–2 in adults, it cannot be injured during the so-called lumbar puncture. Particularly in small children, cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal can also take place from the cerebellomedullary cistern, an expansion of the subarachnoid space between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata (so-called suboccipital puncture).

### Blood-Brain Barrier

Name the components of the blood-brain barrier!
- The blood-brain barrier forms a protective barrier for the brain, preventing the passage of certain harmful substances from the blood into the brain tissue. It consists of three layers. The innermost layer, viewed from the blood side, is formed by the endothelial cells of the capillaries. These are closely connected via tight junctions and thus form the actual diffusion barrier. Other components of the blood-brain barrier are the basal membrane surrounding the capillary endothelium and the externally adjacent pericytes and astrocyte end-feet.
