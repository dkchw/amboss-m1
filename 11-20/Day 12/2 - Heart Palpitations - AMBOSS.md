# Heart Palpitations
## Summary

The heart must contract at regular intervals to supply the human body with blood. For this, the heart muscle cells must also be electrically stimulated regularly. This stimulation can be generated by the heart itself through so-called pacemaker cells.

The sinoatrial node is the primary pacemaker center of the heart and generates these electrical excitations using hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (so-called "Funny Channels"). These open at the end of each excitation cycle and initiate a new excitation cycle through a slight depolarization. These action potentials are transmitted to the myocardium of the atria and ventricles via a conduction system made up of specialized cardiac muscle cells. The coordinated excitation of the myocardium is a prerequisite for a coordinated contraction of the heart. The translation of these electrical signals into mechanical contraction is referred to as electromechanical coupling.

The sum of the electrical processes can be recorded and plotted in the form of characteristic waves, which is then referred to as an electrocardiogram. However, the ECG only allows for the observation of the electrical processes and not the mechanical processes of the heart.
## Excitation Formation and Excitation Conduction System

All structures of the conduction system (formerly also known as the stimulus conduction system) generate their own pacemaker potentials with decreasing basic frequency. This means that the frequency of the sinoatrial node potentials is higher than the action potential frequency of the atrioventricular node, and this is higher than that of the next subordinate pacemaker, and so on. The action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node therefore excite the atrioventricular node before it can generate its own pacemaker action potential. This ensures that the fastest pacemaker is always the one that sets the rhythm (usually the sinoatrial node). If the fastest (primary) pacemaker center fails, the next subordinate pacemaker center (e.g., the atrioventricular node) takes over.

> [!NOTE] Conduction disorders
> The heart's conduction system can be disturbed despite intact impulse formation. The causes are varied and range from heart diseases to electrolyte disturbances to medication overdoses. This can be most easily recognized by recording the electrical heart activity (ECG, see below). Practically any part can be affected by conduction and impulse formation disorders, such as the sinus node (sinoatrial block) or the AV node (atrioventricular block). The left (left bundle branch block) and right bundle branch (right bundle branch block) can also be affected. Since the left bundle branch further divides into three fascicles, only these can also be affected (left anterior hemiblock / left posterior hemiblock). Disturbed or even completely interrupted conduction (as seen in complete AV block) can represent a life-threatening situation.

## Origin and Process of Electrical Heart Action

The pacemaker cells autonomously and spontaneously generate an action potential, which is transmitted to the myocardium. In the myocardium, the pacemaker action potential is supposed to lead to the generation of a working myocardium action potential. The electrical excitation of the myocardium leads to its contraction through so-called electromechanical coupling (see below). For the alternating pump-suction function of the heart, it is essential that a sufficiently long phase of relaxation follows each contraction of the myocardium. Therefore, a cardiac muscle cell, after being excited, is not excitable for a certain period (so-called refractory phase).

### Overview: Process of Heart Excitation

After the action potential is generated in the sinoatrial node, it is coordinated and transmitted through the conduction system to the atria and ventricles. If the primary pacemaker (sinoatrial node) fails, subordinate pacemaker centers take over its function, although at a lower frequency.

1. Atrial excitability
    1. Spontaneous depolarization of the pacemaker cells of the sinoatrial node and generation of an action potential (AP)
    2. Transmission of the APs to the atrial myocardium → Coordinated atrial contraction
    3. Forwarding of the atrial impulses to the AV node
    4. Delay in forwarding the APs in the AV node
2. Excitation of the ventricles
    1. Forwarding of the APs from the AV node via His bundle
    2. Forwarding of the APs to Tawara branch
    3. Conduction via Purkinje fibers → Coordinated excitation of the working myocardium
    4. Coordinated contraction of the working myocardium

> [!NOTE] Atrial fibrillation
> A common heart rhythm disorder is atrial fibrillation. It can occur in various cardiac and extracardiac underlying conditions and affects about 1-2% of the population in Germany. The increased frequency of the atria is slowed down by the AV node, which usually keeps atrial fibrillation clinically asymptomatic. In addition to irregular heartbeats (palpitations) with fluctuating pressure amplitude or rapid heart rate, symptoms of heart failure can also be triggered or worsened due to the lack of synchrony between the atria and ventricles. Moreover, conditions of turbulent flow in the left atrium due to ineffective contraction promote thrombus formation, leading to a significantly increased risk of thromboembolic events.

> [!NOTE] Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
> The coordinated excitation of the heart only functions through the specialized conduction system in connection with the heart skeleton, which electrically isolates the atria from the ventricles. If muscle bundles exist that bypass this isolation layer and thus "short-circuit" the conduction system, the excitation can no longer be properly delayed in the AV node. As a result, the ventricles may be excited too early, which is referred to as a pre-excitation syndrome. An example of this is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, in which a muscle bundle (known as Kent bundle) extends from the atrium to the ventricular myocardium and thus effectively short-circuits the electrical isolation of the heart skeleton. The consequences can include an accelerated heartbeat (tachycardia), dizziness, and/or fainting.

### Formation of a Pacemaker Action Potential

1. Starting point: Pacemaker cell is hyperpolarized to about -60 mV after the previous action potential.
2. Initial Depolarization
    - Opening of funny channels through hyperpolarization → Cations flow into the cell and depolarize it to about −40 mV
    - Opening of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels at approximately −40 mV → Calcium influx and depolarization to about 20 mV
3. Repolarization
    - Closure of L-type calcium channels
    - Opening of delayed outward rectifiers (potassium channels) → Potassium efflux → Repolarization to about -60 mV
    - Closure of the delayed outward rectifier (potassium channels) at about -60 mV
4. Re-depolarization during hyperpolarization through the opening of funny channels.

> [!NOTE]
> Pacemaker cells do not have a stable resting membrane potential. Their special hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (Funny Channels) ensure a spontaneous and renewed depolarization at the end of each repolarization!

> [!NOTE]
> The rise of the action potential in a pacemaker cell is unusually caused by voltage-gated L-type calcium channels. In neurons and other muscle cells, it is usually the fast sodium channels that are responsible!

> [!NOTE]
> The action potential duration differs in the various pacemaker centers of the heart and increases from the sinoatrial node to the Purkinje fibers!

### Formation of a cardiac myocyte action potential

The action potentials of the pacemaker centers are transmitted through the conduction system to the cells of the working myocardium and depolarize them. This opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to flow into the muscle cell. Calcium binds to regulatory proteins of the myofilaments (troponin) and enables the interaction of actin and myosin. The muscle cell contracts. The precise sequence of the molecular interaction of actin and myosin (the so-called sliding filament theory) is covered in the fundamentals of muscle tissue.

1. Stable resting membrane potential: At about –85 mV
2. Spread and "Overshoot"
    1. Excitation of the cardiac muscle cell through the conduction system via gap junctions → depolarization to about -65 mV
    2. Opening of voltage-gated fast sodium channels and closure of the "inward rectifier" potassium channel
    3. Sodium influx up to a membrane potential of about 30 mV ("overshoot") → Closure of all fast sodium channels
3. Partial Repolarization: After the "overshoot," potassium channels briefly open, resulting in repolarization to the level of the plateau (Ito).
4. Plateau phase of the action potential
    - Opening of voltage-gated L-type calcium channels at approximately -40 mV
    - Slow calcium influx → Triggering of calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum → Mechanical contraction (see below: Electromechanical coupling in the heart)
    - Elimination of calcium through Na+/Ca2+ exchangers and Ca2+ ATPases → muscle relaxes
5. Repolarization
    1. Slow decrease in calcium conductivity
    2. Opening of the delayed outward rectifiers (potassium channels) by depolarization → potassium efflux from the cell → repolarization
6. Stable resting membrane potential: At approximately –85 mV
    - Further potassium efflux through inward rectifier (potassium channels) → Stabilization of the resting membrane potential
7. Reapplication during excitation by the excitation conduction system

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of repolarization is primarily to restore the inactivation of the fast sodium channels, thereby allowing the initiation of a new action potential!

> [!NOTE]
> The special feature of the action potential in cardiac muscle is the plateau phase, which allows the muscle cell sufficient time for mechanical contraction!

> [!NOTE]
> The inward-rectifier potassium channels important for the resting membrane potential and the fast sodium channels important for depolarization play no role in the pacemaker cells of the heart!

> [!NOTE] Cardioplegia
> During open-heart surgeries, an artificial cardiac arrest (cardioplegia) often needs to be induced so that the surgical team can work more accurately and calmly. For this purpose, highly potassium-rich solutions are used, among others. The high extracellular potassium concentration leads to a sustained depolarization of the cardiomyocytes. The sustained depolarization prevents repolarization and thus maintains the inactivation of the sodium channels, so that no further action potentials are triggered, resulting in diastolic cardiac arrest.

> [!NOTE] Arrhythmogenic potential of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
> The outward flow of Ca2+ through the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger contributes to the decrease of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and thus to the cessation of contraction. However, due to an unphysiological Ca2+ overload (e.g., during ischemia), there can be an increase in the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Since each Ca2+ is exchanged for 3 Na+, this leads to a net influx of positive charges into the cell, thereby shifting the resting membrane potential in a positive direction and, if the threshold is exceeded, triggering another action potential. These so-called late depolarizations can lead to cardiac arrhythmias.

### Refractory Period of the Working Myocardium

After a cardiac muscle cell has been excited, there comes a phase in which it cannot be excited again for a short time: the refractory period. Due to the very long action potentials of cardiac muscle cells (200–400 ms), the initially excited cardiac muscle cells are still refractory while the last ones are still being excited. This prevents circulating excitations on one hand and gives the cardiac muscle cells enough time to contract and relax in succession without being "disturbed" by renewed excitations on the other hand!

- Refractory period: The refractory period describes how long a (heart) muscle cell is completely (absolutely) or only very difficultly (relatively) excitable again.
    - Absolute refractory period: The fast sodium channels are completely inactivated during the plateau phase of the action potential of the working myocardium, which is why no new action potential can be triggered.
    - Relative refractory period: The fast sodium channels can be partially reactivated at around -40 mV, which is why very strong stimuli can trigger small action potentials with a less steep rise.
- Vulnerable phase of electrical cardiac action: During the repolarization phase, parts of the heart are relatively refractory, so that a new excitation can trigger a new action potential, and so-called reentrant excitations can occur between the excited and unelevated parts of the heart.

> [!NOTE]
> The plateau phase of the action potential of the working myocardium is usually longer than the actual contraction. This allows the heart muscle to relax after each contraction. A permanent contraction (so-called tetany) is thereby prevented!

> [!NOTE] Ventricular fibrillation
> During the so-called vulnerable phase of heart excitation, parts of the myocardium are already relatively refractory (and thus excitatory) while other parts are still absolutely refractory (and therefore not excitatory). If an additional excitation occurs during this phase (e.g., due to an extrasystole or an electric shock), unphysiological, circulating excitations can arise in the ventricles. A coordinated ventricular contraction is then not possible, leading to a drastic drop in cardiac output. Therefore, this condition, referred to as ventricular flutter or fibrillation depending on the frequency, represents an acutely life-threatening situation and should be interrupted as quickly as possible through electrical defibrillation.

## Electromechanical Coupling

Pacemaker cells of the heart generate action potentials, which are transmitted through the conduction system to the myocardium. There, the action potentials are translated into mechanical muscle contraction. This process is referred to as "electromechanical coupling." The excitation that spreads across the cell membrane of the muscle cells (sarcolemma) must be transferred to the intracellular contractile apparatus. For this purpose, the cell membrane has deep invaginations (T-tubules) that allow the spreading excitations to penetrate deep into the cell and reach the contractile apparatus. Here, the electrical excitation facilitates the influx of calcium into the heart muscle cell, which serves as a trigger for the subsequent massive release of calcium from the stores of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the intracellular calcium concentration increases significantly and enables the interaction of the myofilaments actin and myosin, which is prevented at low calcium concentrations. This is followed by the contraction of the myofilaments and subsequently a normalization of the intracellular calcium concentration through elimination into the extracellular space and the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

### Overview of Involved Structures

In the section "Development and Course of the Electrical Heart Action," ion channels and pumps of the heart are summarized. Here, however, only the receptors and pumps that are involved in electromechanical coupling are described.

### Procedure

1. Unexcited myocardial cell (intracellular calcium concentration about 10−7 mol/L)
2. Excitation of the myocardial cell
    1. Myocardial cells are excited by the action potential of a pacemaker center.
    2. Excitation spreads across the myocardial membrane into the T-tubules → Opening of the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels there
3. Calcium influx from extracellular ("Calcium ignition spark")
    1. Calcium influx from the extracellular space into the cytosol through L-type calcium channels.
    2. Activation of the ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic reticulum by incoming calcium
4. Calcium-induced calcium release
    1. Calcium flows out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor into the cytosol.
    2. Increase in intracellular calcium concentration from 10−7 mol/L to 10−5 mol/L (calcium-induced calcium release)
5. Muscle contraction due to high calcium levels
    1. Binding of calcium to troponin C → Actin binding sites are released
    2. Interaction of actin and myosin filaments → Mechanical contraction
6. Relaxation through the reduction of intracellular calcium concentration
    1. SERCA pumps calcium actively back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum
    2. Calcium-ATPase and sodium-calcium antiporter pump calcium from intracellular to extracellular.
    3. Calcium concentration in the cytosol decreases → Interaction of myosin and actin is prevented → Relaxation
7. Unexcited myocardial cell: Intracellular calcium concentration was normalized to 10−7 mol/L → Re-excitation possible (→ 2.)

> [!NOTE]
> The increase in intracellular calcium concentration (e.g., through the sympathetic nervous system) during contraction enhances the force developed by the muscle (so-called positive inotropy)!

> [!NOTE] Pulseless electrical activity
> In the case of a heart attack, if a situation arises where electrical excitation is generated but is no longer translated into mechanical contractions, it is referred to as so-called electromechanical dissociation. This acutely life-threatening condition cannot be treated with electrical defibrillation, so cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the treatment of the cause of electromechanical dissociation are the primary therapeutic focus.

> [!NOTE] Cardiac glycosides
> The so-called heart glycosides (digoxin, digitoxin) occur in nature in plants of the genus foxglove (lat. "Digitalis"). They are used as reserve agents in advanced heart failure or for frequency control of absolute tachyarrhythmia. Their mechanism of action is based on inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase of cardiomyocytes, thereby indirectly increasing the intracellular calcium content. This enhances the contraction force (positive inotropic) and slows down the conduction of impulses in the heart (negative dromotropic).

## Recording of electrical heart activity (ECG)

The so-called electrocardiogram (ECG) is a procedure that measures the onset and spread of the electrical activity of the heart. This is done using electrodes that are attached to the skin of the patients. The ECG can provide indications of a variety of diseases associated with changes in heart excitation (e.g., heart attack, arrhythmias).

### Basics of ECG Recording

The excitation of the heart spreads progressively from the pacemaker centers of the heart. Thus, a part of the heart muscle cells is always excited while another part remains unexcited. Electric fields are created between excited and unexcited cells. The sum of these electric fields can be measured using electrodes placed on the skin.

- Charge differences between excited and non-excited heart muscle cells
    - Excited heart muscle cell: Cell surface is negatively charged
    - Unexcited cardiac muscle cell: Cell surface is positively charged
- Creation of an electrical potential difference
    1. Excited cells form the "negative" pole and unexcited cells form the "positive pole" → There is an electrical potential difference between the two poles (vector from negative to positive)
    2. Measurement of electrical potential differences using electrodes on the skin

### Derivatives of the ECG

A standard 12-lead ECG is derived with six limb leads (I, II, III, aVL, aVF, aVR) and six chest leads (V1–V6).

One differentiates between two forms of derivation:

- Bipolar derivations: The voltage is measured between two electrodes – e.g. in lead I between the electrode on the right hand and that on the left hand.
- Unipolar leads: The voltage is measured between one electrode and an indifferent reference point.

#### Limb Derivations

- Components: Six derivatives in the frontal plane
    - Three bipolar limb leads: I, II, III (Einthoven leads)
    - Three unipolar limb leads: aVR, aVL, aVF (Goldberger leads)
- Practical application: When standing in front of the person being examined, the electrodes are placed in a clockwise direction from the right arm in the traffic light phases of red, yellow, and green, plus a 4th electrode on the right leg.

#### Chest wall derivations

- Components: Six unipolar chest wall leads V1–6 (Wilson leads) in the horizontal plane
- Practical application: The electrodes are placed in the 4th and 5th intercostal spaces from right parasternal to left at the level of the midaxillary line.

> [!NOTE]
> In the physiological state, the amplitude of the R wave increases in height from V1/2 to V6, while the amplitude of the S wave continuously decreases! The point where the R wave is larger than the S wave for the first time is referred to as the "R/S transition"!

### Meaning of the individual sections of the EKG

- Null line: Isoelectric line
- Fluctuations: Waves or peaks, positive or negative
- Temporal Sections
    - Isoelectric section between two sections: distance
    - Section that has both spikes/waves and isoelectric components: Time/Interval

#### P-wave

- Definition: The P wave corresponds to the spread of excitation in the atria.
    - Starting point of the excitation: Sinoatrial node
    - Spread: From the right atrium to the left atrium
    - Vector: Direction to the apex of the heart
    - Endpoint: Atria fully excited → ECG line returns to the isoelectric line
- Morphology: Semi-rounded, generally positive rash.
    - Duration: ≤0.10 seconds
    - Amplitude <0.25 mV

#### PQ Time and PQ Distance

- PQ time: Time between the beginning of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex (intraatrial excitation propagation and atrioventricular conduction)
    - Duration: ≤0.20 seconds
- PQ interval: Time between the end of the P wave and the beginning of the QRS complex (isoelectric line)
    - Duration: ≤0.10 seconds

> [!NOTE] Disorders of atrioventricular conduction: AV blocks
> The conduction of impulses through the AV node can be disturbed in various ways: If the electrical impulses from the atrium are merely delayed, this leads to a prolonged PQ interval, but the QRS complex occurs regularly and is normally configured (AV Block Grade I). If not every impulse is conducted, individual QRS complexes are dropped (not every P is followed by a QRS complex, AV Block Grade II). The most severe form of AV conduction disturbance is AV Block Grade III: In this case, no impulses from the atrium are conducted to the ventricle. Since this can be life-threatening, the implantation of a pacemaker is usually performed in the case of AV Block Grade III.

#### QRS Complex

- Definition: The QRS complex corresponds to the spread of excitation in the heart ventricles.
    - The inner layer of the heart chambers is excited before the outer layer.
    - At the end of the QRS complex, the entire chamber is excited.
- Morphology and Meaning
    - Q-Zacke: Initial negative deflection of the QRS complex
    - R-Zacke: Every positive deflection of the QRS complex
    - S-Zacke: Any negative deflection of a QRS complex that is preceded by an R.
- Duration: ≤ 0.1 seconds

#### ST-Route

- Definition: The ST segment extends from the end of the S wave to the beginning of the T wave and corresponds to the complete depolarization of the ventricles.
    - During this time, no potential difference is measurable (isoelectric line)

> [!NOTE] ST-Track-Elevation
> The assessment of the ST segment is clinically particularly important, as an elevation of the ST segment (a course above the isoelectric line) can be an indication of myocardial hypoperfusion (ischemia)! If an ST elevation occurs acutely in the leads of a heart area and the affected person additionally suffers from typical symptoms such as chest pain, a heart attack should be assumed.

#### T-Welle

- Definition: The T wave corresponds to the repolarization of the ventricular excitation.
- Course: Positive if the QRS complex is positive; negative if the QRS complex is also negative (so-called "concordance of the T wave")

#### QT-Time

- Definition: Time from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave; corresponds to the total intraventricular activation duration, including depolarization and repolarization of the ventricles.
- Duration: Approx. 0.35–0.44 seconds
    - The QT interval is dependent on the heart rate.
    - Increase in heart rate → Shortening of QT interval

> [!NOTE] Congenital Long QT Syndrome
> The QT interval in the ECG corresponds to the complete spread of excitation and repolarization of the ventricles. In some individuals, the QT interval is prolonged due to genetic changes in various ion channels or associated proteins (so-called congenital Long QT syndromes). In one form of this condition, the L-type calcium channels of the ventricles are altered, causing them to close more slowly. This not only prolongs the plateau phase of the action potential but also the entire action potential of the working myocardial cell and thus the QT interval.

### Basics of ECG Interpretation

#### Paper Feed

- Standard for 12-channel ECGs in Germany: Paper feed of 50 mm/s → Time intervals can be easily recorded on millimeter paper.
    - 1 mm = 0.02 s or 20 ms
- Rare: Paper feed of 25 mm/s
    - 1 mm = 0.04 s or 40 ms
- Amplitude: 1 mm (vertical) corresponds to 0.1 mV

#### Heart Rhythm

When assessing the heart rhythm, it should be checked whether a sinus rhythm is present. The following criteria must be met for this:

1. Presence of normally configured P-waves
2. A QRS complex regularly follows each P wave.

If the PP intervals are also constant, a regular sinus rhythm is present.

> [!NOTE] Respiratory arrhythmia
> The heart rate can change depending on breathing: it rises during inspiration and decreases again during expiration. The cause is a central coupling of respiration and the circulatory center, so it is a physiological phenomenon. Particularly pronounced respiratory arrhythmias are found in children; however, the extent decreases with increasing age.

> [!NOTE] AV-Dissociation
> Normally configured, regular P waves occur, but they are not regularly followed by a QRS complex; this indicates a so-called AV dissociation. This means that the atria and ventricles are being excited independently of each other. Therefore, there is no sinus rhythm present. The cause of such dissociation is often a failure of conduction of the impulse from the atria through the AV node to the ventricles (AV block Grade III). Since the impulse from the sinus node does not reach the ventricular myocardium, a substitute pacemaker is formed, the frequency of which is different (lower) than that of the sinus node.

> [!NOTE] Extrasystoles
> Premature heartbeats (extrasystoles) are relatively common in the ECG, but they do not necessarily indicate a disease. A distinction is made between supraventricular and ventricular extrasystoles: Supraventricular extrasystoles originate from above the His bundle, the QRS complex has a normal configuration, and the next QRS complex follows at a normal interval. In contrast, the excitation in ventricular extrasystoles occurs later in the conduction system and leads to wide, deformed QRS complexes in the ECG. Since the next normal excitation encounters refractory ventricular myocardium, the RR interval to the next beat is prolonged.

#### Heart Rate

- Determination: The heart rate is calculated based on the distance between two R-peaks (RR interval).
    - At 50 mm/s
        1. HF = 300/RR-distance in cm
        2. Alternative: HF = 60/RR-distance in seconds
    - At 25 mm/s: HF = 150/RR distance in cm
    - In practice, frequency can also be determined using an ECG ruler.
- Interpretation
    - Normal heart rate: 50–100/minute
    - Tachycardia: >100/Minute
    - Bradycardia: <50–60/minute

#### Determination of the Lag Type

The lead type corresponds to the main vector of intraventricular depolarization (main vector of the QRS complex) and projects onto the frontal plane. It is determined using the limb leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF and is also referred to as the electrical heart axis.

##### Simplified Method

One looks at the QRS complex and assesses whether it is positive or negative. A QRS complex is positive if the area above the isolectric line is greater than that below – negative, conversely. The main vector (orientation type of the electrical heart axis) is the lead with the highest positive deflection (or, more precisely, with the "largest positive area") closest to it.

##### Exact determination using the Cabrera circle

The method of determining the position type described above is indeed quick and simple, and therefore very common in clinics. However, the determination using the Cabrera circle is more precise.

- Construction of the Cabrera circle: The vectors of all six extremity derivations are drawn starting from a common center.
    - Generates a so-called polarogram with a division of angles at intervals of 30°.
    - Each derivation is thus assigned a specific angle in the Cabrera circle (e.g. I → 0°, II → 60°, aVF → 90°, III → 120°)
- Determination of the type of position
    - Certain angular sections are assigned their respective position types (e.g. left type between -30° and +30°)
    - The type of lead for the ECG corresponds to the angular section in which the main vector is located.

> [!NOTE] Clinical significance of the position types
> The physiological heart axis lies in the range of −30° to 90°, extending from left to indifferent to steep type. Children and adolescents may also exhibit a right type, but with increasing age and weight, the heart axis shifts from right to left. A (over-rotated) right type in adults may indicate right heart strain or a conduction disturbance in the area of the right ventricle.
> Swapping the electrodes of the right and left arm leads, among other things, to a mirroring of lead I, which results in a change of the main vector and thus the determination of an incorrect lead type.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Heart Excitation
### Excitation Formation and Excitation Conduction System

Which structures belong to the excitation formation and conduction system?  
- The excitation formation and conduction system includes the sinus node (Nodus sinuatrialis), the AV node (Nodus atrioventricularis), the AV/His bundle (Fasciculus atrioventricularis), the Tawara branches (Crus dextrum et sinistrum), as well as the Purkinje fibers (Rami subendocardiales).  
Where exactly is the sinus node located?  
- The sinus node is located in the right atrium at the junction of the superior vena cava, subepicardially in the sulcus terminalis.  
What is the so-called heart skeleton? Which structure does it run through or bridge?  
- The heart skeleton is a connective tissue layer that electrically isolates the atria and ventricles (and serves as an anchor for the heart valves). At the right fibrous trigone (Trigonum fibrosum dextrum), the heart skeleton is pierced by the atrioventricular bundle (Fasciculus atrioventricularis, His bundle); thus, an electrical bridge between the atria and ventricles is formed.  
Why do the chambers contract slightly later than the atria during systole, and which structure of the conduction system ensures this?  
- Cardiac excitation conduction is strongly slowed down in the AV node, because the ventricles must contract slightly later than the atria for optimal filling.  

### Origin and Course of the Electrical Heart Action

Describe the formation of a pacemaker potential including the involved channels!  
- The formation of a pacemaker potential begins with the hyperpolarization of the pacemaker cell to about −60 mV. Due to hyperpolarization, so-called funny channels (non-selective cation channels) open; cations flow into the cell until at about -40 mV, the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels open. The subsequently inflowing calcium ions depolarize the cell further to about 20 mV. The initial depolarization of the action potential in the sinus node is thus caused by funny channels and L-type calcium channels. Repolarization begins with the closing of the L-type calcium channels. Then the delayed rectifier potassium channels open. Potassium flows out, resulting in repolarization to about −60 mV. At about −60 mV the delayed rectifiers close and a new excitation cycle begins.  
What are the so-called pacemaker centers of the heart and how does the action potential duration differ in the various pacemaker centers?  
- The sinus node is the primary pacemaker center of the heart, the AV node the secondary. The ventricular conduction system is summarized as the tertiary pacemaker center. The action potential duration increases from the sinus node towards the Purkinje fibers.  
Describe the depolarization of the working myocardium including the involved channels!  
- Initially, the working myocardium has a resting membrane potential of −85 mV, stabilized by the so-called inward rectifier (potassium channel). An action potential from the pacemaker centers is transmitted to the working myocardium via the conduction system; further excitation spreads through gap junctions. Upon depolarization of the cardiac muscle cell to about −65 mV, voltage-activated fast Na⁺ channels open; simultaneously the inward rectifier closes. Na⁺ ions flow in until the membrane potential reaches about 30 mV ("overshoot"); then the fast Na⁺ channels close again.  
Describe the plateau phase of a working myocardial action potential including the channels involved! What is the so-called electro-mechanical coupling?  
- Immediately after the "overshoot", a K⁺ and a Cl⁻ channel open briefly, causing repolarization to the level of the plateau. The long-lasting plateau phase at about 0 mV is crucial so that the cardiac muscle cell has sufficient time to contract, and is stabilized by voltage-activated L-type calcium channels (which already open at about −40 mV). Through them, a slow inflow of Ca²⁺ ions occurs. The Ca²⁺ influx leads to Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing mechanical contraction (electromechanical coupling). Calcium is then eliminated by the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX), sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA), and plasma membrane Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA), and the heart muscle relaxes. There is a gradual decrease in the calcium permeability of the channels.  
Describe the repolarization of a working myocardium including the involved channels!  
- As a result of depolarization, the delayed rectifier potassium channels open at the end of the plateau phase; K⁺ flows out of the cell, initiating repolarization. The further steady K⁺ outflow through inward rectifier potassium channels stabilizes the resting membrane potential at about −85 mV.  
How do circular excitations arise and what factors promote them? How do they manifest clinically?  
- In disturbed excitation conduction or recovery, some parts of the myocardium are excited later than others. While they are still refractory, other regions of the myocardium can already be excited again. If an extrasystole occurs during this so-called vulnerable phase, circular excitations can arise. This is favored by a shortened action potential duration and slowed conduction velocity. Due to the high frequency of the circular excitations, no orderly contraction takes place; the heart’s pumping ability is drastically reduced. Therefore, this condition, called ventricular fibrillation or flutter, is acutely life-threatening.  

### Recording of electrical heart activity (ECG)

What distinguishes bipolar from unipolar leads? What role does this play in the derivation of a normal 12-lead ECG?  
- In bipolar leads, the voltage between two electrodes is measured; in unipolar leads, it is measured between one electrode and an indifferent reference point. In the normal 12-lead ECG, limb leads are created by different connections of two arm electrodes and one foot electrode. The leads according to Einthoven (I, II, III) are bipolar; here two electrodes are compared against each other. The leads according to Goldberger (aVL, aVF, aVR) are unipolar; here two electrodes are combined against the third. For example, swapping the arm electrodes for lead aVF has no consequence.  
How do the amplitudes of the R and S waves change in the chest leads of a 12-lead ECG physiologically?  
- Under physiological conditions, the amplitude of the R wave increases from V1/2 to V6, while at the same time the amplitude of the S wave continuously decreases. The point where the R wave first becomes larger than the S wave is called the R/S transition.  
What is referred to as AV block III° and how does it manifest in the EKG?  
- AV blocks are disturbances of the atrioventricular conduction (so-called AV dissociation). The most severe form is AV block grade III, in which conduction from the atrium to the ventricle is completely interrupted. Since subordinate pacemaker centers take over for the sinus node, the heart rate can drop extremely to about 20/min, which is called bradycardic ventricular escape rhythms. In the ECG, P waves and QRS complexes appear completely independently but regularly (complete dissociation). The more peripheral the autonomous center is, the slower the escape rhythm. Because this can be life-threatening, implantation of a pacemaker is usually performed in AV block grade III.  
Organize the sections of the ECG according to the corresponding phases of the cardiac cycle, including the state of the heart valves!  
- During the P wave and the PQ interval, excitation spreads in the atria and is conducted to the ventricles. This occurs during the filling phase; the AV valves are therefore open and the semilunar valves closed. The QRS complex corresponds to excitation spread in the ventricles. Initially, the inner layer of the ventricles is excited, then the outer layer. At the end of the QRS complex, the entire ventricle is excited, producing the subsequent isoelectric ST segment (no measurable charge difference). The QRS complex is mainly temporally assigned to the isovolumetric contraction phase (all valves closed), the ST segment mainly to the ejection phase (semilunar valves open, AV valves closed). The T wave marks the repolarization of the ventricles, which occurs at the end of the ejection phase.  
How long is the QT interval normally, and how does it change with an increase in heart rate? What do you know about the development of congenital Long QT Syndromes?  
- The QT interval corresponds to the complete excitation spread and repolarization of the ventricles and normally lasts about 0.35–0.44 seconds. It shortens with an increase in heart rate. In congenital Long QT syndromes, the QT interval is prolonged due to genetic alterations of various ion channels or associated proteins. For example, in one form of this disease, the L-type calcium channels of the ventricles are altered so that they close more slowly. This prolongs the plateau phase of the action potential and thus the QT interval.  
During the auscultation of an 11-year-old child, you notice a change in heart rate depending on the breathing. What is the most likely explanation for this?  
- Heart rate can physiologically vary with respiration, which is called respiratory arrhythmia. With inspiration, heart rate increases; with expiration, it decreases again. The cause is probably a central coupling of respiratory and circulatory centers. It is especially pronounced in children and diminishes with increasing age.  
How can the heart rate be determined from an ECG and what is the normal value?  
- Heart rate is calculated based on the distance between two R waves (RR interval). At 50 mm/s paper speed, this corresponds to HR = 300 / RR interval in cm or alternatively HR = 60 / RR interval in seconds. A simple ECG ruler can make frequency determination easier. Normal heart rate corresponds to 50–100 bpm (beats per minute); tachycardia is defined as >100 bpm; bradycardia at <50–60 bpm.  
What is referred to as a left type or over-excited left type?  
- The position type corresponds to the main vector of the intraventricular excitation spread (main vector of the QRS complex). The QRS complex is examined to assess whether it is positive or negative. In the over-rotated left type (ÜLT), lead I is positive, leads II and III are negative. In the left type, leads I and II are positive, III is negative.  
How can the position type be determined exactly using the Cabrera circle?  
- First, the vectors of all six limb leads are plotted from a common center point. A so-called polarogram is obtained with angular subdivisions at 30° intervals. Each angle corresponds to a specific ECG lead (e.g., lead I corresponds to 0°). The segments between two angles represent the position types (e.g., the left type lies between 0° and 30°). Then the QRS main vector, i.e., the electrical heart axis, is determined. The ECG position type corresponds to the angular section in which the main vector lies.
