# Physiological Aspects Prenatal and Postnatal
## Summary

During pregnancy and the development of the child, numerous physiological changes occur in both the pregnant woman and the child. In the fetus, the supply of nutrients and oxygen must be ensured so that organ development can proceed without disturbances. In the newborn, the transition of the circulatory system after the onset of lung breathing is the focus. Physiological changes also take place in the mother during pregnancy to optimally prepare the maternal organism for the care of the child and for childbirth. After birth, the maternal hormone levels change again to ensure the regression of the uterus and to enable breastfeeding of the child.
## Physiological Aspects in the Fetus

The fetal period extends from the 9th week of development until the birth of the child. After all organs have been formed during the embryonic period (1st to 8th week of development), this time mainly involves the growth and differentiation of the organ systems. The fine structure and function of the individual organs develop slowly in many cases, and in some instances, development continues even after birth. The fetal circulation and the function of the fetal organs differ significantly from those of a child or an adult. The intrauterine conditions ensure that nutrient and gas exchange occurs through the fetoplacental unit. Additionally, the metabolism and hormonal supply, especially at the beginning of development, are largely provided by the mother.

> From the fetal period, the length of the child can be approximately determined via ultrasound using the crown-heel length (CHL). Simply put, it can be said that it corresponds to the square of the number of life months in centimeters!

> [!NOTE]
> From the 6th month of development, the month number only needs to be multiplied by 5. A fetus in the 7th month of development would then have an approximate SFL of 35 cm.

## The Fetal Period

In the fetal period (9th embryonic week - birth), the main processes are the growth and differentiation of the tissues and organs established during the embryonic period. The fetal stage is characterized at the beginning by a significant increase in size, and from the sixth month onwards, primarily by a strong weight gain of the fetus. However, the body parts do not grow simultaneously and not at the same pace, but heterochronously. In particular, the growth of the head lags behind the growth of the rest of the body.

|Development Weeks|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|9.–12. week|- Return of the intestinal loops from the umbilical cord (10th week)<br>- Liver, as the primary site of erythropoiesis, is replaced by the spleen (12th week)<br>- Urine formation begins → Urine excretion into the amniotic fluid → Embryo starts to swallow amniotic fluid<br>- Fetal waste products are transferred to the maternal circulation via the placenta<br>- Gender identification becomes possible (12th week)<br>- Despite a decrease in head growth and the doubling of the crown-rump length by the end of the 12th week, the head remains disproportionately large<br>- Extremities have nearly reached their proportions|
|13.–16. week|- Coordinated movements of arms and legs begin (14th week)<br>- Bones of the fetus are clearly visible in the ultrasound due to active ossification (16th week)<br>- Rapid growth<br>- Proportions of head and body adjust|
|17–20 weeks|- Fetal movements become noticeable<br>- Skin covered with vernix caseosa ("cheesy substance")<br>- Hair on the head and eyebrows visible, body completely covered with lanugo hair|
|21.–25. week|- From the 22nd embryonic week, the survival of a premature infant is theoretically possible<br>- Beginning of surfactant secretion to keep the lung alveoli open<br>- Fingernails are forming<br>- Beginning of fat deposition<br>- Significant weight gain|
|26.–29. week|- At this age, many premature infants survive with intensive medical care<br>    - Lung tissue is sufficiently mature to allow gas exchange<br>    - The CNS is mature enough to initiate breathing and regulate body temperature<br>- Blood formation in the bone marrow (28th week)<br>- Opening of the eyelids<br>- Toenails recognizable|
|30.–34. week|- Light reflex triggered<br>- Survival of the newborn during these weeks is the norm|
|35.–38. week|- After the 37th week of pregnancy, the child is ready for birth|
## Fetal Circulation

The fetal circulation must meet various conditions: On the one hand, it must be structured in such a way that it meets the needs of the fetus under the prenatal conditions of placental supply without lung breathing. Furthermore, it must also allow for a rapid transition to postnatal conditions.

### Promoting Factors of Fetal Oxygen Supply

The prenatal oxygen supply is primarily facilitated by the following factors:

- Difference in the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) between maternal and fetal blood (pO2 maternal > pO2 fetal)
    - In maternal arterial placental vessels, the O2 partial pressure is about 50 mmHg.
    - In the fetal oxygenated blood of the umbilical vein, the O2 partial pressure is about 30 mmHg.
- HbF has a higher oxygen affinity than adult HbA.
- Bohr Effect

### O2-rich blood

- Placenta → Umbilical vein → Inferior vena cava → Right atrium
    - 50%: Umbilical vein → Liver → Inferior vena cava → Right atrium
    - 50%: Umbilical vein → Ductus venosus → Inferior vena cava → Right atrium
- 1. Short circuit
    - Right atrium → Foramen ovale (of the heart) → Left atrium → Left ventricle → Ascending aorta → Head, neck, and arm vessels

### O2-weapons blood

- Head, neck, and arm vessels → Superior vena cava → Right atrium
- 2. Short circuit
    - Right atrium → Right ventricle → Pulmonary trunk → Ductus arteriosus Botalli → Aortic arch and descending aorta → Common iliac artery
        - Return of deoxygenated blood to the placenta: A. iliaca interna → A. umbilicalis → placenta
        - Supply of the lower extremity: A. iliaca externa → Lower extremity → Vena cava inferior

> [!NOTE]
> The umbilical veins transport oxygen-rich blood from the placenta towards the fetal heart, while the umbilical arteries carry oxygen-poor blood from the fetus towards the placenta!

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the high resistance in the pulmonary trunk, the pressure in the right systemic circulation is on average higher than in the left!

> [!NOTE] Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
> The hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a rare congenital heart defect that, however, represents one of the most common causes of cardiogenic death in newborns. Due to a closure of the aortic and mitral valves, blood cannot pass through the underdeveloped left ventricle, rendering it nonfunctional. The survival of the newborn relies on the perfusion of the systemic circulation through the patent ductus arteriosus Botalli as well as a connection between the two atria via the open foramen ovale. Until the heart surgery, the ductus arteriosus Botalli must therefore be kept open with medication, as hypoplastic left heart syndrome is no longer compatible with life after the peripartum circulatory transition.

## Fetal Organ Function

The fetal circulation and the fetal organ functions differ significantly from those of a child or adult. The intrauterine conditions ensure the exchange of nutrients and gases through the fetoplacental unit. The lungs are not ventilated and are only minimally perfused. Other organ functions also develop gradually during prenatal development, some even continuing after birth. The table aims to provide an overview of the differences between fetal and adult organ function. The development of organs will not be discussed here; it will be addressed in the respective organ chapters.

|Organ|Overview for Function Development|
|---|---|
|Endocrine System|- Maternal Hormones<br>    - Thyroid hormones and glucocorticoids can cross the placental barrier; the remaining maternal hormones only occasionally enter the fetal circulation<br>- Fetal Hormones<br>    - Insulin and glucagon: Produced by the fetus as early as the first weeks of development<br>    - DHEA: Produced in the physiologically enlarged adrenal cortices of the fetus and utilized by the placenta for estrogen synthesis<br>    - Cortisol: Produced in the adrenal gland starting from the 34th week of development|
|Circulatory|- End of the 4th week of development: The heart contracts so coordinated that there is a directed blood flow<br>- Until the 9th week of development: Development of the fetal circulation<br>- Heart rate: 120–160/min|
|Lunge|- 11th week of development: First respiratory movements occur<br>- 24th week of development: Beginning of surfactant production under the influence of cortisol<br>- Postnatal: The majority of alveoli are formed only postnatally|
|Liver|- Metabolic function: Begins from the 6th week of development<br>- Bilirubin excretion: During pregnancy, it is still the task of the placenta, gradually taken over by the liver after birth|
|Blood and Immune System|- Blood Formation: From the 3rd week of development in the mesenchyme of the yolk sac wall, later in the liver and spleen.<br>- Gas Exchange: O2 affinity in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is particularly high to ensure the diffusion of oxygen from maternal to fetal hemoglobin. This makes the release of oxygen to fetal tissue more difficult.<br>- Hemoglobin Concentration: Significantly higher than in the adult organism due to the impaired gas exchange across the placenta and the resulting lower arterial fetal oxygen saturation.<br>- Immunoglobulins: The fetus does not produce immunoglobulins; however, it receives maternal IgG (nest protection).|
|Gastrointestinal tract|- Full functionality in the 3rd trimester<br>- Fetus swallows amniotic fluid, which is absorbed in the intestine → Meconium forms|
|Kidney|- Glomerular Filtration: Urine production begins between the 9th and 12th week of development<br>- Ability to concentrate urine: Develops only after birth|
|Brain|- Myelination: Begins in the late fetal period and continues into the first year postnatally|
## Physiological Aspects in Newborns

After birth, the onset of lung breathing and the separation from the placenta require an adjustment of the circulatory system. The shunts of the fetal circulation close, and the child adapts to the conditions outside the womb.
## Postnatal Adjustment of the Newborn

After birth, the placental circulation is interrupted, the newborn takes its first breath, and its organism must adapt to the conditions outside the uterus (so-called postnatal adaptation): circulation, respiration, metabolism, and thermoregulation must now be managed independently, which requires a series of adjustment reactions. In about 95% of newborns, this process occurs without any issues. However, since approximately 5% of mature newborns experience regulatory disturbances, one should monitor the child's vital signs using the APGAR scores as well as blood sugar and temperature checks.

### Adjustment of Circulation and Breathing

- Initiation: Implementation of lung respiration
- Changes
    - Ventilation of the lungs: First breaths → Alveoli are filled with air → Lungs expand → Change in pressure conditions
        - Follow
            - Closure of the ductus arteriosus Botalli: pO2 in the pulmonary arteries↑ → Pulmonary vascular resistance↓ and lung perfusion↑ → Flow reversal in the ductus arteriosus Botalli → Functional closure of the ductus by contraction of smooth muscle cells (due to the decrease of vasodilating prostaglandins and the rise in pO2) → Intimal proliferation and obliteration of the ductus to the ligamentum arteriosum
            - Closure of the foramen ovale: Increased pulmonary blood flow → Pressure in the pulmonary veins and left atrium ↑ → Simultaneously reduced resistance in the pulmonary arteries → Pressure in the right atrium ↓ → Functional closure of the foramen ovale → Fusion of the two septa → Fossa ovalis remains as a remnant of the former septum primum
            - Closure of the umbilical arteries: Contraction of the umbilical arteries → Prevention of blood loss → Obliteration within 2–3 months
                - Proximal portion of the umbilical artery (patent part): Remains open and forms the proximal portion of the superior vesical artery.
                - Distal portion of the A. umbilicalis (Pars occlusa): Becomes the medial umbilical ligament in the medial umbilical fold of the anterior abdominal wall.
            - Closure of the umbilical vein: Remains open initially after birth → Later closure to the ligamentum teres of the liver
            - Closure of the ductus venosus: Obliterates later than the ductus arteriosus and becomes the ligamentum venosum.
    - Hemoglobin: Replacement of fetal HbF with adult HbA, whereby the hemoglobin concentration initially decreases in the first weeks of life due to the increased breakdown of HbF.

> [!NOTE] Persistent Ductus Arteriosus Botalli
> If the physiological closure of the ductus arteriosus Botalli does not occur after birth, part of the blood flows back from the aorta into the pulmonary vessels (left-to-right shunt). This leads to volume overload of the pulmonary circulation and thus of the left atrium and ventricle. Over time, pulmonary hypertension with right heart strain may develop.

### Metabolism

- Change: Due to the cessation of continuous glucose supply from the placenta, the blood sugar level of the newborn rapidly decreases → risk of hypoglycemia
- Adjustment: Mature neonates meet their energy requirements through gluconeogenesis and the external supply of breast milk.
    - Thanks to a high position of the larynx, infants can even drink and breathe at the same time.

### Thermoregulation

- Normal body temperature of the newborn 36.5–37.5°C
- Change: Large body surface area and the loss of intrauterine heat lead to heat loss.
- Adjustment: In particular, newborns with regulatory disorders rely on external protection against cooling!

> [!NOTE] Apgar Score
> Using the Apgar score, the vital parameters and thus the child's adjustment to the outside world are assessed and documented 1, 5, and 10 minutes after birth. Skin color (Appearance), heart rate (Pulse), response to suction (Grimace), muscle tone (Activity), and breathing (Respiration) are each rated from 0 to 2 points. A score of 9–10 indicates a normal adjustment, while values below 5 are considered vital threats and usually require further measures.

> [!NOTE] Lung maturity
> In case of complications during pregnancy with the risk of preterm birth, the lung maturity of the child can be induced to avoid or reduce postnatal regulatory disorders. For this purpose, the mother is injected intramuscularly with a glucocorticoid twice within 24 hours, which accelerates the maturation of the surfactant-producing pneumocytes. This procedure is indicated during the period between the attainment of viability (23–24 weeks of gestation) and the completion of lung maturity (33–34 weeks of gestation).

## Maturity Signs of the Newborn

A newborn is considered ripe if it is born between the completed 37th week of pregnancy and the end of the 42nd week of pregnancy. Before that, it is considered a premature birth, and later it is considered a post-term birth.

- Normal values
    - Height: approx. 50 cm
    - Body weight: approx. 3–3.5 kg
    - Head circumference: approx. 35 cm
    - Respiratory rate: approx. 40/min
    - Heart rate: Between 120 and 160/min
    - Bilirubin: 0.2–0.5 mg/dL
    - pH-Metry: ≥7.2 (slightly more acidic than in adults)
    - First urination: Within 24 hours after birth
    - Meconium passage (first stool of the newborn): Within 48 hours after birth
- Presence of ripeness indicators

## Physiological Aspects in the Mother

The pregnancy lasts for a period of about 40 weeks and is accompanied by numerous changes in the female organism. During the period from fertilization to birth, there is an adjustment of the hormonal balance (Hormonal situation during pregnancy) and numerous physiological adaptation processes occur. Only in this way is the maternal organism optimally prepared for the care of the child and childbirth. After birth, the maternal hormone levels change again. This enables, on one hand, the involution of the uterus, and on the other hand, it allows lactation so that the child can be breastfed.
## Physiological Adjustments of the Mother During Pregnancy

Due to hormonal changes (especially from the hormone production of the fetoplacental unit), a series of adaptation processes occur in the female organism. During pregnancy, the uterus changes and adjusts to the requirements for the growth and protection of the fetus. As the child grows, the uterus increasingly changes its position and shape. It grows to several times its original size and occupies a large part of the abdominal cavity by the end of pregnancy.

### Adjustment Processes of the Uterus During Pregnancy

- Changes in wall layers
    - Endometrium: Development of the placenta (see LK Prenatal protection and supply structures)
    - Myometrium
        - Hypertrophy: Enlargement of individual muscle cells
        - Hypertrophy: Increase in muscle cells
        - Increased formation of gap junctions between uterine muscle cells
        - Increased blood circulation
- Weight: Due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia, the weight of the uterus increases from 60 g to 1000 g.
- Form: Changes its shape from pear-shaped to egg-shaped
- Stand: As the child grows, the uterus aligns and the fundus rises higher.

#### Estimation of the increase in the size of the uterus based on the fundal height

The increase in size of the uterus during pregnancy can be directly inferred from the position of the fundus uteri.

> [!NOTE]
> In the 24th week of pregnancy, the fundus is about at the level of the navel!

|SSW|Fundal position|
|---|---|
|20.|Between the symphysis and the navel|
|24.|Belly button|
|32.|Between the navel and the xiphoid|
|36.|Highest point: At the rib arch|
|40.|2 Cross finger under the rib arch|
## Hormonal Adjustment of the Mother After Giving Birth

As the postpartum period, the six to eight-week timespan from childbirth until the regression of pregnancy- and birth-related changes is referred to. The postpartum period also marks the beginning of lactation. However, a prerequisite for this is the complex interplay of several hormones (e.g., prolactin, oxytocin) and the mechanical stimulation from suckling at the breast.

### Hormonal Changes After Childbirth

After pregnancy, the removal of the placenta leads to a hormonal change that is beneficial for the regression of the uterus as well as for the nutrition of the child.

- Placental hormone
    - Abrupt decline after birth
    - Estrogen and progesterone levels↓
        - Inhibitory effect due to high estrogen and progesterone levels is eliminated → Induction of lactation
- Prolactin
    - For breastfeeding mothers further ↑: Stimulation of the nipples during breastfeeding acts as a strong secretion stimulus → Without breastfeeding, the levels normalize within 2–3 weeks
        - Maintenance of milk production
        - High prolactin levels inhibit ovulation by inhibiting FSH and LH (lactational amenorrhea)
- Oxytocin
    - Further ↑: In particular, the stimulation of the nipples during breastfeeding acts as a strong secretion stimulus.
        - Milk injection
        - Uterine contraction → Promotes involution
## Review Questions on the Chapter Physiological Aspects Pre- and Postnatal
### Physiological Aspects in the Fetus

At what stage of development can the crown-heel length (CHL) of a child be determined by ultrasound? Do you know a simplified calculation method?
- The crown-heel length (CHL) can be determined by ultrasound from the fetal period (from the 9th week onwards). It can be simplifiedly calculated using the square of the pregnancy month (= CHL of the fetus in cm). For example, a fetus in the 3rd month of life would have a CHL of approximately 9 cm.
Describe the flow of oxygen-rich blood from the placenta to the aorta.
- The fetus is supplied with oxygen-rich blood via the placenta, which enters the fetal circulation through the umbilical vein. About half of the blood flows through the liver and then reaches the inferior vena cava, while the other half is directed via the ductus venosus directly into the inferior vena cava. This then empties into the right heart, where two shunts allow bypassing the non-ventilated lungs: through the open foramen ovale, oxygen-rich blood can flow directly from the right atrium into the left atrium and from there through the ventricle into the aorta. Another shunt is the so-called "ductus arteriosus Botalli," which connects the pulmonary trunk and the aortic arch or descending aorta.
Through which vessel is the oxygen-poor blood of the fetus directed back to the placenta?
- The return flow of oxygen-poor blood to the placenta occurs via the umbilical arteries, which run together with the oxygen-rich umbilical vein in the umbilical cord.
Describe the pressure conditions in the right and left atrium before and after birth.
- Prenatally, due to the collapsed pulmonary vessels, there is high resistance in the pulmonary trunk. Since this is downstream from the right atrium, higher pressure conditions exist there than in the left atrium. At the onset of breathing after birth, the lungs expand and a reversal of pressure occurs in the atria.
Compare adult and embryonic/fetal organisms regarding the site of blood formation and hemoglobin concentration!
- Prenatal hematopoiesis (blood formation) begins already in the 3rd week of development and initially takes place in the mesenchyme of the yolk sac wall, later in the liver, spleen, and red bone marrow. In contrast, adult hematopoiesis occurs exclusively in the red bone marrow. The hemoglobin concentration of fetal blood is significantly higher than that of adult blood, which is caused by the difficult gas exchange via the placenta and consequently the lower fetal arterial oxygen saturation.
In what range does the fetal heart rate physiologically lie?
- The fetal heart rate physiologically lies between 120 and 160/min.
### Physiological Aspects in Newborns

Describe how the closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs after birth.
- The postnatal adaptation of circulation is initiated by the onset of lung breathing. The increase in pO2 in the pulmonary arteries and the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance lead to an increase in lung perfusion. The pressure conditions in the aorta rapidly exceed those of the right heart, resulting in a flow reversal in the ductus arteriosus Botalli. The functional closure of the ductus is triggered within a few days by the contraction of smooth muscle cells; obliteration to the ligamentum arteriosum occurs within the first year of life by intimal proliferation.
The remnants of which short circuit of the fetal circulation can still be found in adults as the ligamentum venosum?
- The ligamentum venosum in adults corresponds to the obliterated ductus venosus, which prenatally connects the umbilical vein and inferior vena cava.
### Milestones of Child Development

From which month of life should an infant be able to sit or stand independently?
- An infant should be able to sit independently from approximately 9 months of age and stand independently from 12 months.
### Physiological Aspects in the Mother

The increase in size of the uterus during pregnancy can be observed at the position of the fundus uteri. In which week of pregnancy is the fundus approximately at the level of the navel?
- The fundus of the uterus moves cranially with growth during pregnancy. In the 24th week of pregnancy, it is approximately at the level of the navel.
Describe the adaptations of the myometrium to the demands during pregnancy.
- The uterus must enlarge enormously during pregnancy. The myometrium hypertrophies (enlargement of individual muscle cells) and hyperplasias (increase in number of muscle cells). In addition, there is an increase in blood flow and the formation of gap junctions between uterine muscle cells that enable synchronous contraction during birth.
How do blood volume and hematocrit change during pregnancy?
- Due to a decrease in peripheral resistance, pregnancy leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and consequently increased water retention with continuous blood volume increase. Although there is some reactive increase in erythrocyte production, this results in a relative decrease in erythrocyte number and consequently also hematocrit.
Through which mechanism can breastfeeding promote the involution of the uterus after childbirth?
- Stimulation of the nipple during breastfeeding acts as a strong secretory stimulus for the hormone oxytocin. This promotes not only milk ejection but also contraction of the uterus and thus its regression.
