# Lipids
## Summary

Lipids are one of the four classes of substances, alongside carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleotides, that make up the building blocks of living organisms.

While the other three classes of substances are defined by their chemical properties and therefore exhibit structural similarities, lipids are defined by a physical property, namely their solubility. They are thus, in terms of chemical structure, a large and very heterogeneous group of molecules, whose common feature is their poor water solubility (they are therefore hydrophobic or apolar). Responsible for this are the long hydrocarbon chains, which mostly form the backbone of the molecules counted as lipids. Some lipids additionally have a polar head group along with the apolar hydrocarbon chains. These molecules are referred to as amphiphilic.

According to their chemical structure, lipids are divided into subgroups: fatty acids, triacylglycerols, phospholipids, sphingolipids, and isoprenolipids. Fatty acids and triacylglycerols are important energy carriers in the organism. They are stored in adipose tissue and can be mobilized from there when needed. The amphiphilic phospho- and sphingolipids are capable of forming an interface with water through their polar head groups. The resulting lipid bilayer is of paramount importance for living organisms, as it forms the basic structure of biological membranes that surround every cell. The isoprenoid lipid cholesterol is also an important component of membranes and further serves as a precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids.
## Overview

Lipids are a large and heterogeneous group, whose common characteristic is that they are poorly soluble in water (= hydrophobic). In most lipids, the poor water solubility (referred to as "non-polarity") is due to long carbon chain segments. However, there are also lipids that have hydrophilic molecular structures in addition to the non-polar chains. These lipids are referred to as amphiphilic, as they are both fat-soluble and partially water-soluble.

### Classification of Lipids

- Classification by chemical structure
    - Apolar
        - Fatty acids
        - Triacylglycerols (TAGs)
        - Isoprenoids (e.g. Terpenes and Steroids)
    - Amphiphilic: Molecules with a non-polar fat-soluble part and a polar water-soluble part
        - Strength: Increases with the number and importance of the water-soluble and fat-soluble groups in the molecule.
        - Examples
            - Phospholipids (e.g. Phosphoglycerides)
            - Sphingolipids (e.g. Sphingomyelin, many glycolipids)
- Classification by Saponification
    - Saponifiable lipids: All lipids with an ester bond that can undergo saponification.
        - TAGs, Phosphoglyceride
    - Non-saponifiable lipids: All lipids without ester bonds
        - Fatty acids, isoprenoids

### Behavior of amphiphilic lipids in aqueous solution

In aqueous solution, amphiphilic lipids assemble in such a way that the polar structures form an interface with the water and the nonpolar structures have no contact with the water.

- Mizelle: Spherical aggregate of amphiphilic lipids; the polar heads are stretched outward and interface with the aqueous medium, while the nonpolar tails extend inward and form their own phase.
- Liposome: A vesicle that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer and encloses an aqueous phase.
- Lipid bilayer

## Digestion and Absorption of Lipids

The lipids ingested with food (particularly TAGs, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters) cannot be easily absorbed by the enterocytes due to their apolarity (or amphiphilicity) and molecular size. During the digestion process, they are therefore broken down by lipases in the gastric and intestinal lumen and subsequently packaged into water-soluble structures, the micelles. These micelles can then interact with the membranes of the enterocytes and release the substances for absorption.

### Digestion

- Lipids in food
    - Sources: including dairy products, meat, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, plant oils, avocado
    - Presence: Mainly as triacylglycerols (TAGs)
- Lipases: Esterases that cleave fatty acids from TAGs and cholesterol esters. Typical representatives include, for example,
    - Lingual lipase
        - Place of education: Sublingual glands of the mouth
        - Function: Component of saliva; breaks down TAGs in the stomach, as this lipase exhibits its highest activity at an acidic pH.
    - Magenlipase
        - Place of education: Main cells of the stomach
        - Function: Splits about 15% of the TAGs from food in the stomach into β-monoacylglycerin and two fatty acids.
    - Pancreatic lipase
        - Place of education: Exocrine part of the pancreas
        - Secretion: Through the pancreatic duct together with the other digestive enzymes into the duodenum
        - Function: Primarily splits the remaining TAGs (mainly with long-chain fatty acids) into β-monoacylglycerin and two fatty acids.
    - Hormone-sensitive Lipase
        - Place of education: Mainly in the cells of adipose tissue
        - Function: Splits the triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols stored in adipocytes into monoacylglycerols (lipolysis)
    - Lipoprotein lipase
        - Place of education and secretion: Mainly in adipose tissue and muscle
        - Occurrence: On the extracellular side of the cell membrane, especially of endothelial cells of the blood capillaries in various tissues.
        - Function: Splits the triacylglycerols bound in lipoproteins (e.g., in chylomicrons) in the blood into fatty acids and glycerol, thereby preparing them for uptake into the cells.

> [!NOTE] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
> A pancreatic insufficiency is associated with a reduced secretion of digestive enzymes and can lead to maldigestion syndrome. This is manifested by a lack of nutrient supply and so-called fatty stools (steatorrhea). Possible causes of pancreatic insufficiency include pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or a blockage of the pancreatic duct by a tumor.

### Resorption

The split products of fat digestion combine with bile acids to form mixed micelles.

- Uptake into the enterocytes
    - Micelles break down upon contact with the brush border of the enterocytes.
    - Breakdown products of fat digestion enter the enterocytes by free diffusion.
- Further processing in enterocytes

## Transport of Lipids

In body fluids, lipids are transported bound to proteins; for example, triglycerides and cholesterol are present in the blood in the form of lipoproteins. This ensures, on one hand, that they reach their defined target location, and on the other hand, that they do not precipitate in the blood as fat droplets. The lipoproteins consist of a core of hydrophobic lipids surrounded by a shell of more hydrophilic lipids and proteins (the so-called apolipoproteins). Lipoproteins can be classified into five main classes, which differ in their lipid and apolipoprotein composition – and thus in their density.

### General Structure of Lipoproteins

- Core: Hydrophobic Lipid
- Shell: Hydrophilic lipid components and hydrophilic proteins, so-called apolipoproteins
    - Function: Keep the hydrophobic lipids in solution and contain signals that regulate transport to certain cells.
    - Special feature: Some apolipoproteins can be exchanged between different lipoproteins, e.g. ApoC and ApoE are transferred from HDL to VLDL.

### Overview of Lipoproteins

| Lipoprotein class                       | Diameter (nm)    | Important contained apolipoproteins | Composition (in %) |                |      |      |      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TAG                                     | Free Cholesterol | Cholesterol Ester                   | Phospholipid       | Apolipoprotein |      |      |      |
| Chylomicrons                            | - 75–1200        | - B-48, C, E                        | - 86               | - 1            | - 4  | - 7  | - 2  |

| HDL (High Density Lipoproteins)         | - 7.5–20         | - A-I, C, E                         | - 5                | - 5            | - 20 | - 30 | - 40 |

> [!NOTE]
> The lipid-protein ratio is highest in chylomicrons!

> [!NOTE]
> The TAG content of lipoproteins increases in the order HDL < LDL < IDL < VLDL < chylomicrons!

> [!NOTE]
> The fatty acids in the blood are transported not in the form of lipoproteins, but bound to albumin!

### Function, Biogenesis, and Degradation of Lipoproteins

#### Chylomicrons

Chylomicrons are very TAG-rich lipoproteins that are synthesized in the mucosal cells of the intestine and are largely broken down by the membrane-bound lipoprotein lipases of the endothelial cells of extrahepatic tissue.

- Function: Chylomicrons transport the TAGs absorbed from food from the mucosal cells of the duodenum via the lymphatic system into the bloodstream.
- Biogenesis
    1. Resynthesis of the TAGs split during digestion in the mucosal cells
    2. Transport of the TAGs to the rough ER
    3. Cotranslational association with specific apolipoproteins
    4. Transport to the Golgi apparatus, packaging into secretory granules
    5. Release into the extracellular space via exocytosis
    6. Entry into small lymphatic vessels and transport via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream
- Deconstruction
    1. Exchange of apolipoproteins with HDL in the blood; chylomicrons receive ApoC and -E
    2. Breakdown of the contained TAGs by lipoprotein lipase on the capillary endothelium of extrahepatic tissue, especially heart and skeletal muscle, adipose tissue
    3. Uptake of released fatty acids by tissues
    4. Remnants: Breakdown in the liver

> [!NOTE]
> ApoC-II is a cofactor of lipoprotein lipase!

#### VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein)

VLDLs are also very TAG-rich lipoproteins. They are synthesized in the liver and, just like chylomicrons, are broken down by lipoprotein lipases.

- Function: VLDL particles transport endogenously formed TAGs as well as cholesterol from the liver to the extrahepatic tissues.
- Biogenesis
    1. Synthesis of TAGs in the smooth ER of hepatocytes
    2. Transport to the rough ER
    3. Cotranslational association with specific apolipoproteins
    4. Packaging in secretory granules and exocytosis
- Deconstruction
    1. Enrichment with ApoC and ApoE through apolipoprotein exchange with HDL in the blood
    2. Breakdown of the contained TAGs by lipoprotein lipase
    3. Conversion to IDL ("VLDL remnants") and uptake by liver cells or further conversion to LDL

#### LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein)

LDLs are the cholesterol-richest lipoproteins. They contain Apolipoprotein B-100 as a characteristic protein, meaning its proportion is significantly higher than that of VLDL and IDL. For clinical significance, see also: parameters of lipid metabolism.

- Function: LDL particles primarily transport cholesterol and cholesteryl esters from the liver to the extrahepatic tissues, where they serve, among other things, as building blocks for membranes and as starting materials for biosyntheses.
- Biogenesis: Formation in the liver from IDL and release into the blood
- Deconstruction
    1. Binding to the LDL receptor of extrahepatic tissues (The ligand for the LDL receptor is ApoB-100)
    2. Uptake of the LDL/LDL receptor complex via endocytosis
    3. Fusion of endosomes with lysosomes
    4. Cleavage of apolipoproteins by acid proteases, cleavage of cholesterol esters by acid lipases, LDL receptor is recycled.
    5. Free cholesterol leaves the lysosome and affects two enzymes at the smooth ER.
        - Activates the acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and thus the esterification and storage of cholesterol.
        - Inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and thus cholesterol biosynthesis

#### HDL (High Density Lipoprotein)

HDLs, the lipoproteins with the highest density, exist in at least three subforms. For clinical significance, see also: parameters of lipid metabolism.

- Function: HDL particles transport cholesterol and cholesteryl esters from the extrahepatic tissues to the liver, where they are excreted.
- Biogenesis
    - HDL precursors (disk-shaped HDL)
        - Are formed from ApoA-I synthesized in the liver and small intestine, to which phospholipids and cholesterol attach, among others.
        - Binds the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) synthesized by the liver.
            - From LCAT catalyzed reaction: Cholesterol + Phosphatidylcholine ⇄ Cholesteryl ester + Lysophosphatidylcholine
            - Activation of LCAT: Through the ApoA-I contained in HDL
            - The cholesterol esters are transported into the interior of the HDL, freeing the surface for the binding of additional cholesterol.
    - HDL1, HDL2, HDL3: Formed with increasing cholesterol content, which is caused by LCAT activity.
- Degradation: Via Scavenger receptor (SR-B1 receptor) on hepatocytes and steroid hormone-producing cells
    - Binds HDL3, uptake via endocytosis
    - In the liver: Oxidation of the contained cholesterol to bile acids or direct excretion with bile

> [!NOTE] Pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis
> The scavenger receptor is primarily located on hepatocytes but is also present on macrophages. It has the highest affinity for cholesterol-rich HDL (HDL3) but can also take up oxidatively modified LDL. This plays a special role in the development of atherosclerosis: Due to damage in the vessel wall, plasma components enter the vessel wall. LDL can be oxidized through interaction with vascular cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages. This oxidized LDL is now taken up by the macrophages via the scavenger receptor. Since the scavenger receptor pathway, unlike the LDL receptor pathway, is not subject to regulation, oxidized LDL enters macrophages uncontrollably. The increasing cholesterol content in the macrophages is noticeable through the deposition of cholesterol droplets, which appear "foamy" under the microscope. Therefore, macrophages are also called "foam cells." These foam cells subsequently undergo apoptosis as the cholesterol content continues to rise, and their contents are emptied into the subendothelial tissue, forming the basis for an atherosclerotic plaque.

> [!NOTE] Dyslipidemias
> Usually, lipoproteins in the blood exist in a specific ratio to each other. If this composition shifts, it is referred to as a lipid metabolism disorder (dyslipidemia). Hypolipoproteinemia – that is, the reduction of a certain lipoprotein class – is very rare and is usually based on a genetic defect. Much more common is hyperlipoproteinemia, in which there is an increase in the concentration of certain lipoproteins (mainly LDL and VLDL) and thus a relative decrease in the concentration of other lipoproteins (mainly HDL). Hyperlipoproteinemia can also be genetically determined (primary hyperlipoproteinemia, such as familial hypercholesterolemia caused by a defect in the LDL receptor), but much more frequently, it is secondary hyperlipoproteinemia as a result of an underlying condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus, alcoholism) or dietary mistakes (obesity). Hyperlipoproteinemias increase the risk of vascular diseases (such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease) and therefore pose a serious health risk. Aside from hyperlipoproteinemias, there is also the isolated increase of TAGs (hypertriglyceridemia) and cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), which have similar health consequences.

## Overview of Lipid Metabolism

Just like the structure of individual lipid classes, their metabolism is also very different. The following sections provide an overview of the most important metabolic pathways:

- Metabolism of fatty acids and triacylglycerols
- Cholesterol metabolism
- Metabolism of ketone bodies
- Metabolism of phospholipids

## Metabolism of Ketone Bodies

As ketone bodies, the three substances acetacetate, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate are referred to. In a catabolic metabolic state, β-hydroxybutyrate primarily serves as an alternative energy carrier for the brain as well as the skeletal and cardiac muscles.

### Synthesis of Ketone Bodies

Ketone bodies are formed when there is an excess of Acetyl-CoA, but it cannot be processed further in the citric acid cycle. This is the case, for example, during food deprivation or a low-carbohydrate diet. In this situation, increased fatty acid breakdown generates a lot of Acetyl-CoA; however, the citric acid cycle is inhibited because the intermediate product oxaloacetate is needed for gluconeogenesis.

The synthesis of ketone bodies takes place exclusively in the mitochondria of hepatocytes! Subsequently, the ketone bodies are released into the blood and transported to their target organs (mainly the brain and muscles)!

> [!NOTE]
> Acetyl-CoA → Acetoacetyl-CoA → HMG-CoA → Acetoacetate → β-Hydroxybutyrate!

> [!NOTE]
> Acetone is produced by spontaneous decarboxylation from acetoacetate. The organism has no use for acetone, so it is expelled with the breath!

> [!NOTE] Diabetic Ketoacidosis
> In diabetes mellitus (primarily type 1), the organism is tricked into a state of starvation due to the lack of insulin (because glucose does not reach the cells, even though it is present in sufficient amounts in the blood), to which it reacts, among other things, with excessive synthesis of ketone bodies. The feared consequence can be diabetic ketoacidosis, where the "acidic" ketone bodies accumulate in the organism and the acidic milieu increasingly impairs essential organ functions, potentially leading to coma. One sign of this is a sweet odor of the exhaled air (smells like nail polish remover), which is caused by the high concentration of acetone.

### Utilization of Ketone Bodies

The liver cannot utilize ketone bodies itself and therefore releases them into the blood in the form of β-hydroxybutyrate. With the exception of erythrocytes, all other organs and tissues are capable of utilizing ketone bodies. The reactions of ketone body breakdown occur in the mitochondrial matrix.

## Metabolism of Phospholipids

Phospholipids are a large group of amphiphilic molecules. With their polar "heads" and nonpolar "tails," they can form lipid bilayers and are therefore the most important membrane components of the organism. Additionally, they are precursors to important signaling molecules. Based on their chemical backbone structure, two groups of phospholipids are distinguished: the phosphoglycerides (glycerophospholipids), which are derived from glycerin, and the sphingolipids with sphingosine as their backbone.

### Phosphoglyceride

#### Chemical Structure of Phosphoglycerides

- Structure: Phosphoglycerides have glycerin as a common backbone, which is esterified at C1 and C2 with one fatty acid each and at C3 with a phosphate group that carries an alcoholic residue.
    - Phosphatidylcholine (Lecithin): Glycerin + two fatty acids + phosphate + choline
    - Phosphatidylethanolamine (Kephaline): Glycerin + two fatty acids + phosphate + ethanolamine
    - Phosphatidylserine: Glycerin + two fatty acids + phosphate + serine
    - Phosphatidylinositol: Glycerin + two fatty acids + phosphate + inositol

#### Degradation and Resorption of Phosphoglycerides

Phosphoglycerides can be broken down by extracellular phospholipases secreted into the gastrointestinal tract. Additionally, there are intracellular phospholipases that break down membrane components and are partially involved in signal transduction.

- Enzyme for the breakdown of phosphoglycerides: Phospholipases
    - Phospholipase A
        - Division into Phospholipase A1 and A2
        - Reaction: Catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bond between the C1 atom (Phospholipase A1) or C2 atom (Phospholipase A2) in glycerol and the fatty acid in glycerol-containing phospholipids.
        - Product: A free fatty acid and a corresponding lysophospholipid
    - Phospholipase B (often referred to as lysophospholipase): Catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bond between a fatty acid and the C1 or C2 atom of the glycerol moiety in lysophospholipids, e.g., in lysolcithin.
    - Phospholipase C: Catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond between the phosphate group and glycerol.
    - Phospholipase D: Catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond between the phosphate group and the alcoholic residue (Choline, Ethanolamine, Serine, Inositol)
- Digestion of phosphoglycerides from food
    - Degradation: In particular by phospholipase A2
    - Resorption
        - Fatty acids: After micelle formation by means of free diffusion
        - Glycerin: By means of free diffusion
        - All others: Via corresponding carrier proteins
    - Further processing: Resynthesis to phosphoglycerides in the enterocytes

#### Synthesis of Phosphoglycerides

Phosphoglycerides can be synthesized de novo from glycerol, fatty acids, phosphate, and the respective residue. However, they can also be quite easily interconverted. In general, they undergo rapid turnover, reflecting the dynamics of cell membrane structures. The synthesis occurs at the smooth ER.

- De novo synthesis
    - The first step corresponds to the first step of TAG synthesis: Phosphatidate (diacylglycerol-3-phosphate) is formed from glycerol-3-phosphate and two fatty acids.
    - For the next step (esterification of phosphatidate with one of the alcohols), one of the two reaction partners must be activated using CDP (cytidine diphosphate).
        - Phosphatidylcholine/Phosphatidylethanolamine: The alcohols are activated to CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine.
        - Phosphatidylinositol/Phosphatidylserine: Phosphatidic acid is activated to CDP-diacylglycerol.
    - Subsequently: Combining the reactants with the removal of CMP (Cytidine monophosphate)
- Synthesis from existing phosphoglycerides
    - Phosphatidylcholine: Is formed through stepwise triple methylation from Phosphatidylethanolamine.
    - Phosphatidylserine: Is formed by the enzymatic exchange of ethanolamine to serine from phosphatidylethanolamine.
    - Phosphatidylethanolamine: Is formed among other things by vitamin B6-dependent decarboxylation from phosphatidylserine.

#### Phospholipids and Signaling Molecules

Phosphoglycerides are the main components of biological membranes. However, they also fulfill important functions in the area of signal transduction (the conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular metabolic processes). The following signaling molecules are cleaved from membrane phosphoglycerides by phospholipases.

- Inositol trisphosphate (IP3): Causes an increase in intracellular calcium concentration
    - Starting substance: Phosphatidylinositole (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate)
- Diacylglycerin (DAG): Activates protein kinase C
    - Starting substance: Phosphatidylinositole (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate)
- Arachidonic acid: Serves as the starting point for the synthesis of eicosanoids.
    - Starting substance: Preferably phosphatidylethanolamine

> [!NOTE] Surfactant
> Phosphatidylcholine is an important component of surfactant, a substance that reduces the surface tension of the lung alveolar fluid. If there is not enough phosphatidylcholine available, for example, due to a disturbance in the synthesis pathway, it leads to a surfactant deficiency that prevents the uniform expansion of the lung after birth. This disorder is a possible cause of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and can be treated with the administration of synthetically produced surfactant.

### Sphingolipid

Sphingolipids make up about 10-20% of membrane lipids. They influence the fluidity of membranes and serve as precursors for second messengers.

#### Chemical structure of sphingolipids

Sphingolipids resemble phosphoglycerides in their structure, but in them, glycerin is replaced by the diaminomethanol sphingosine.

- Ceramide: Sphingosine + a fatty acid
- Sphingomyelin: Ceramide + Phosphorylcholine residue
- Cerebroside: Ceramide, glycosidically linked with Galactose
- Sulfatide: Cerebroside + Sulfuric acid
- Ganglioside: Ceramide + branched oligosaccharide chain

The basic structure of all sphingolipids is ceramide, in which sphingosine is linked to a fatty acid via an amide bond!

#### Degradation of Sphingolipids

Sphingolipids are broken down by lysosomal hydrolases.

- Sphingomyelin: Degradation by sphingomyelinases to ceramide, through the removal of the phosphorylcholine group.

#### Synthesis of Sphingolipids

Sphingolipids are synthesized in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi apparatus. Initially, the common intermediate ceramide is formed, which serves as the starting point for the biosynthesis of all other sphingolipids.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Lipids
### Digestion and Absorption of Lipids

In which cells is hormone-sensitive lipase produced and what reaction does it catalyze?
- Hormone-sensitive lipase is primarily produced in adipocytes and hydrolyzes stored tri- and diacylglycerols there, releasing free fatty acids to monoacylglycerols (lipolysis).

### Transport of Lipids

Name the lipoproteins in order of their percentage of TAG content! Which lipoprotein has the highest cholesterol content?
- The TAG content of lipoproteins increases proportionally with diameter in the order HDL < LDL < IDL < VLDL < chylomicrons. LDLs contain the highest proportion of cholesterol (free cholesterol and cholesterol esters).
Which lipoprotein has the highest lipid-protein ratio?
- Chylomicrons consist to a large extent of triacylglycerols (TAG) and have the highest lipid-protein ratio compared to the other lipoproteins.
How are free fatty acids transported in the blood?
- Unlike other lipids (e.g., triacylglycerols, cholesterol), free fatty acids are not present as lipoproteins in the blood but are transported bound to albumin.
Describe the function of lipoprotein lipase! Which apolipoprotein typically activates it?
- Unlike other lipids (e.g., triacylglycerols, cholesterol), free fatty acids are not present as lipoproteins in the blood but are transported bound to albumin.
What apolipoprotein do LDLs typically carry and what is its function?
- LDLs carry apolipoprotein B-100 as a characteristic protein. It serves as a ligand for the LDL receptor of extrahepatic cells. After binding, the LDL/LDL receptor complex can be taken up into cells via endocytosis.
How do Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDLs) convert into Intermediate Density Lipoproteins (IDLs)?
- The density of lipoproteins is determined by their protein content: the higher the protein content, the higher the density of the lipoprotein. After VLDLs (very low density lipoproteins) reach the extrahepatic target tissues, apolipoprotein C and E are enriched in the blood. This enables the cleavage of TAG by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. The loss of lipids increases the percentage of protein content, and VLDLs become IDLs (intermediate density lipoproteins).
What is the function of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and how is it activated?
- The enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is synthesized by the liver and binds to HDL in the blood. It is activated by apolipoprotein A-I contained in HDL and catalyzes the transfer of a fatty acid from lecithin to free cholesterol, producing a cholesterol ester bound to the HDL surface. The cholesterol ester is taken into the interior of the HDL and can thus be transported to the liver for degradation.
### Metabolism of Ketone Bodies

Name the three ketone bodies, their site of formation, and their common precursor!
- The three substances acetacetate, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate are referred to as ketone bodies. They are formed exclusively in the mitochondria of liver cells from acetyl-CoA.
When does an increased synthesis of ketone bodies typically occur? What function do they serve?
- The synthesis of ketone bodies is increased when there is an excess of their precursor acetyl-CoA. This is typically the case in a fasting state or insulin deficiency when fatty acids are increasingly broken down for energy production (lipolysis). The resulting acetyl-CoA is normally further processed in the citric acid cycle. However, this is inhibited under glucose deficiency, among other reasons because its intermediate oxaloacetate is needed for gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the liver uses the accumulated acetyl-CoA for ketone body production, which serve as energy carriers for other organs and tissues (particularly CNS, skeletal and cardiac muscle).
Describe the reaction steps of the synthesis of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, mentioning the enzymes involved!
- In the first step of ketone body synthesis, two molecules of acetyl-CoA are joined into acetoacetyl-CoA by ketothiolase. By adding another acetyl-CoA with the help of β-HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA is subsequently formed. During the cleavage of HMG-CoA catalyzed by β-HMG-CoA lyase, the ketone body acetoacetate is produced, which can be reduced to β-hydroxybutyrate by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.
How is acetone produced and what happens to it in the body afterward?
- Acetone is produced by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Since the body has no use for acetone, it is exhaled with the breath. This causes a characteristic sweet breath odor at high concentrations.
Which organs or tissues can utilize ketone bodies? Which organ relies particularly heavily on ketone bodies in the case of glucose deficiency?
- Ketone bodies can be used for energy production by all organs and tissue types except erythrocytes and the liver. In glucose deficiency, brain cells are particularly dependent on ketone body metabolism (especially β-hydroxybutyrate), as they are unable to obtain energy from β-oxidation of fatty acids.
Describe how β-hydroxybutyrate can be reintroduced into metabolism!
- β-Hydroxybutyrate is released by the liver into the blood and can be used as an energy source by almost all organs and tissues. It is first oxidized back to acetoacetate in the mitochondrial matrix of the respective cells. Acetoacetate is then activated by binding to succinyl-CoA, producing acetoacetyl-CoA. Finally, two acetyl-CoA molecules are formed in the reaction of acetoacetyl-CoA with free coenzyme A, which are now available to the citric acid cycle.
### Metabolism of Phospholipids

Describe the common framework of all phospholipids and specifically the structure of lecithin!
- Phospholipids consist of a common glycerol backbone esterified at C1 and C2 with a fatty acid each and at C3 with a phosphate group carrying an alcoholic residue. They differ only in the variable residue on the phosphate group; for lecithin (= phosphatidylcholine) this is, for example, a choline residue.
What is the function of cytidine diphosphate (CDP) in the de novo synthesis of phospholipids?
- In the de novo synthesis of phospholipids, phosphatidate (diacylglycerol-3-phosphate) is first synthesized from glycerol-3-phosphate and two fatty acids. For subsequent esterification of the phosphate group with an alcohol residue, the reactants first need to be activated with CDP. For example, in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the alcohol choline is activated to CDP-choline.
The various phospholipids can either be synthesized de novo or converted into one another. How can, for example, phosphatidylserine be converted into phosphatidylethanolamine, and what cofactor is required for this?
- Phosphatidylserine can be decarboxylated to phosphatidylethanolamine (cephalin) with the cofactor vitamin B6.
### Metabolism of Sphingolipids

Describe the common basic structure of sphingolipids! Where are they synthesized?
- Sphingolipids consist of the alcohol sphingosine, which is connected to a fatty acid by an amide bond and carries a variable residue. This basic structure, also called ceramide, is formed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. In the Golgi apparatus, all other sphingolipids are synthesized by attaching different residues to ceramide.
What are cerebrosides, sulfatides, and gangliosides?
- Cerebrosides, sulfatides, and gangliosides all belong to the sphingolipids. Cerebrosides consist of a sugar residue (galactose or glucose) glycosidically linked to a ceramide. Sulfatides are cerebrosides with a sulfuric acid residue, and gangliosides consist of a ceramide and a branched oligosaccharide chain.
What are sphingomyelins made of?
- Sphingomyelins belong to the sphingolipids and are formed from the combination of ceramide and a phosphorylcholine residue. They typically occur in the myelin sheaths of nervous tissue.
