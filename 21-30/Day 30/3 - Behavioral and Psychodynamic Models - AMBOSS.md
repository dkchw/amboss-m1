# Behavioral and Psychodynamic Models
## Summary

There are both behavioral and psychodynamic models that deal with health and illness of the psyche. The behavioral models specifically focus on behavior and cognition, and how these are influenced by learning processes and can affect psychological well-being. The psychodynamic models according to Sigmund Freud, on the other hand, describe the various personality instances and states of consciousness that can be in conflict with one another. Sometimes, individuals confront these conflicts with defense mechanisms.
## Behavioral Models

The behavioral models examine the relationship between environmental influences and thoughts, as well as the resulting behavioral changes. While the learning theoretical model sees environmental reactions as the basis for a person's behavior, the cognitive model assumes that the thoughts and evaluation patterns of the individual influence their behavior and well-being. The cognitive-behavioral model combines both approaches.

### Learning Theoretical Model

- Basic assumption: Behavior is largely learned.
    - A behavior can be functional (goal-oriented) or dysfunctional (not goal-oriented)
    - Dysfunctional behavior can contribute to the development of mental illnesses and maintain them.
    - However, the behavior can also be unlearned.
- Examples of learning theories
    - Classical Conditioning
    - Operant Conditioning
    - Learning by Example

### Cognitive Model

- Basic assumption: Situations and events are evaluated and interpreted. This evaluation and interpretation affect the individual's feelings and emotional state.
    - The (negative) evaluation of a situation can contribute to the development of mental illnesses

### Cognitive-Behavioral Model

- Basic assumption: Both learning processes and the cognitive evaluation of events are significant in the development of mental illnesses.
    - Combination of the learning theoretical and the cognitive model
## Psychodynamic Models

The doctor Sigmund Freud developed the so-called psychodynamic models (also "psychoanalysis"): The topographic model and the structural model. These two models described, on the one hand, the location of mental processes (topographic model) and, on the other hand, three personality instances that should normally be in a dynamic equilibrium (structural model). If this balance is disrupted, Freud posited that it could lead to the development of mental illnesses.

### Topographic Model

The topographic model refers to the location of psychological events and describes three different states of consciousness of the human psyche.

- States of consciousness
    - The Conscious: Immediately accessible information and thoughts
    - The Preconscious: Information retrievable from the memory that runs automatically, such as driving a car.
    - The Unconscious: Inaccessible information, such as, for example, sexual and aggressive drives

### Structural Model

The structural model divides the three instances of personality ("Id," "Ego," and "Superego"), which are in a dynamic equilibrium.

- Personality instances
    - It ("the drives")
        - Always unconscious
        - Seat of the primary drives (sexual drive and aggression drive)
        - Oldest instance (exists from the birth)
        - Works according to the pleasure principle: to gain pleasure and avoid displeasure.
    - Superego ("the conscience")
        - Can be conscious, unconscious, or preconscious
        - Seat of values, norms, and moral concepts → This often leads to conflicts with the (pleasure-oriented) "id"
    - I ("the intermediary")
        - Mostly conscious (but can also be unconscious or pre-conscious)
        - Seat of reality (logical actions, orientation towards real circumstances)
        - Acts as a mediator between the "Id" and "Superego" → For this purpose, the "Ego" employs so-called defense mechanisms.

#### Defense Mechanisms (psych.)

There are various defense mechanisms that the "Ego" uses to mediate between the drives of the "Id" and the conscience of the "Superego." The "Ego" employs these defense mechanisms to resolve conflicts. They are part of normal behavior and only become pathological when they are used too frequently or too dogmatically.

|Defense Mechanism|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Repression|Suppression of an inner drive, a perception, or a fantasy with the displacement of the conscious into the unconscious|
|Denial|A refusal to accept an external reality|
|Isolation|The emotional separation from an event|
|Rationalization|Undesired/unpleasant drives or actions resulting from them are retrospectively given a rational meaning|
|Reaction Formation|Partially unconscious transformation/replacement of a socially unacceptable drive or desire into the exact opposite that is desired/accepted by society|
|Displacement|Emotions are transferred to another person|
|Projection|In projection, one's own feelings, desires, and dislikes are projected onto another person. This often stems from dissatisfaction with oneself, which is then "vented" on another person.|
|Conversion (Psychology)|Psychological conflicts are converted into physical symptoms|
|Sublimation|Primitive drives (psycho-sexual energy) and socially disallowed impulses are transformed into "higher" social and cultural achievements|
|Undoing|An attempt is made to undo a past event by taking action against it afterward, which, however, is ineffective|
|Intellectualization|In intellectualization, the patient abstracts an immediate conflict to such an extent that it no longer seems as concrete to them|

#### Development of Mental Disorders

According to the psychodynamic models, mental disorders arise from an inner psychological conflict between "id" impulses and "superego." Drives are therefore in conflict with moral values. However, in a healthy case, there is a mediation between the two personality instances through the "ego" (reality principle). Only in the absence of this mediation does repression and displacement of the conflict into the unconscious occur, making the conflict clinically relevant.

#### Primary and secondary gain from illness according to S. Freud

According to the psychodynamic models, advantages can be described that accompany an illness. Here, the primary gain from illness is distinguished from the secondary gain from illness. In the case of primary gain, existing conflicts between the "id" and the "superego," and thus the tensions of the "ego," are pushed into the background due to the illness. In the case of secondary gain from illness, the patient recognizes something positive in their illness, as they receive attention and compassion through it, for example.

- Primary Gain of Illness: According to Freud, conflicts between the "Id" and the "Superego" can lead to the development of illnesses - the conflicts then manifest themselves in the illness, so to speak. By the formation of a symptom, however, the conflicts and thus the tension of the "Ego" lose intensity and recede into the background. The symptom acts as a kind of valve.
- Secondary Gain from Illness: Secondary gain from illness refers to the experience of positive aspects of being ill.
    - Financial relief: The patient experiences financial relief, for example, through receiving a disability pension.
    - Increased social attention: The patient is, for example, cared for more within the family.
    - Exemption from role obligations: The patient does not have to fulfill their role as an employee for the time being.
## Review Questions for the Chapter on Behavioral and Psychodynamic Models
### Psychodynamic Models

Name the three personality structures according to Freud and briefly explain their main function!
- Freud divides human personality in his structural model into three instances: the "Id" as the seat of primary drives (sexual drive and aggressive drive), the "Superego" as the seat of values, norms, and moral ideals ("the conscience") and the "Ego" as the seat of reality and mediator between the "Id" and "Superego".
In what way does the psychodynamic illness model view the cause of the development of mental disorders?
- According to the psychodynamic model of disease development, mental disorders are caused by an intrapsychic conflict between "Id" impulses and the "Superego," that is, between the drives and the moral values of an individual. The "Ego" usually plays a mediating role here and tries to reconcile the demands of the "Superego" and the "Id" as well as the requirements of reality, which usually manifests in the form of characteristic defense mechanisms. These are acceptable to a certain extent and not psychologically problematic. However, if the "Ego" cannot sufficiently control the "Id" impulses, the defense mechanisms predominate, pathological behavior solidifies, and a mental disorder develops.
Explain the principle of conflict and defense in psychoanalytic theory!
- Conflict and defense are central principles in the psychodynamic illness model according to Freud. According to this, the "Ego" employs various defense mechanisms to mediate conflicts between the drives of the "Id" and the conscience of the "Superego". These mechanisms correspond to normal behavior aimed at resolving conflict-ridden situations and only become pathological when they are used too frequently or too rigidly.
Describe the defense mechanism of repression and provide an example!
- Repression is a defense mechanism described in psychoanalytic theory, whereby an internal drive, perception, or fantasy is shifted from the conscious to the unconscious. Usually, these are feelings laden with anxiety, shame, or guilt that one cannot or does not want to confront. For example, someone might repress an experience perceived as extremely shameful to such an extent that they no longer remember it.
Explain the terms Rationalization and Sublimation!
- Rationalization and sublimation describe defense mechanisms in psychoanalytic theory. Rationalization assigns a rational meaning or justification post hoc to undesirable or unpleasant drive impulses. Sublimation refers to the suppression of impulses considered primitive (e.g., sexual) or socially undesirable and the expression of these impulses in the form of an activity regarded as of higher value (e.g., cooking, science, art).
What is the term for the defense mechanism in which an emotional separation from an event occurs?
- An emotional separation from an event occurs, for example, when someone speaks very matter-of-factly and unemotionally about the death of a close relative. This defense mechanism is called isolation.
What is the difference between projection and translation?
- Projection and displacement both refer to defense mechanisms in psychoanalytic theory involving other persons. In the case of projection, one's own feelings, desires, or tendencies are shifted onto another person and ascribed to them. This behavior often stems from underlying dissatisfaction with oneself (e.g., criticizing in others exactly the faults one dislikes in oneself). Displacement occurs when emotions actually directed at someone else are "shifted" onto a third person (e.g., aggression toward the boss is not taken out on him, but on the partner).
Which defense mechanism involves behavior that is exactly opposite to the actual feelings?
- The so-called reaction formation describes the partly unconscious transformation of socially unacceptable behavior into the exact opposite desired and accepted by society. For example, someone who actually feels aversion toward a child might care for the child especially attentively. Instead of giving in to their feelings, they behave according to socially accepted norms and thus ward off the unwanted feelings. Another person might be excessively friendly toward a colleague despite actually being annoyed by them.
What is meant by a secondary gain from illness and in what form can it manifest?
- Secondary gain from illness refers to the experience of positive aspects of being ill. This can manifest in forms such as financial relief (e.g., disability pension), increased social attention (e.g., from family), or exemption from role obligations (e.g., at work).
