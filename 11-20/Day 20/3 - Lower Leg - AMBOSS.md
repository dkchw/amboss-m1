# Lower Leg
## Summary

The lower leg consists of the two tubular bones tibia and fibula. Proximally, the lower leg connects to the knee joint, and distally, it connects to the ankle joint; both are important for upright walking. The flexors of the lower leg form the prominent musculature of the calf and must lift the full weight of the body while walking. The strongest tendon in the body, known as the "Achilles tendon", is responsible for the necessary force transfer during this movement.

The lower leg contains muscles, blood vessels, and the two major nerves of the lower leg, the tibial nerve and the fibular nerve, which are closely situated in compartments or loges. An injury to the aforementioned nerves often leads to characteristic gait disturbances in those affected.

This chapter discusses the anatomy of the bones, joints, and muscles of the lower leg and provides an overview of its vascular and nerve supply.
## Bones

The bony lower leg consists of two tubular bones: the medial tibia (shinbone) and the lateral fibula (calf bone).

### Tibia (Shinbone)

- Proximal end: Head of the tibia
    - Tibial plateau: Has two cartilaginous joint surfaces
        - Medial condyle of the tibia
        - Lateral condyle of the tibia
    - Intercondylar eminence: Cartilage-free area between the medial condyle and lateral condyle, attachment point for the cruciate ligaments
- Shaft: Body of the tibia
    - Approximately triangular cross-section
        - Three corner points or "edges"
            - Anterior margin
            - Margo interosseus
            - Medial Margo
        - Three surfaces
            - Medial surface
            - Lateral surface
            - Posterior surface
    - Tibial tuberosity
    - Line of the soleus muscle
- Distal end: Medial malleolus (Inner ankle)
    - Medial malleolar sulcus:

### Fibula (Calf Bone)

- Proximal End
    - Head of the fibula
    - Collum of the fibula
- Shaft: Body of the fibula
    - Three surfaces
        - Medial surface
        - Lateral surface
        - Posterior surface
- Distal end: Lateral malleolus (outer ankle)
    - Lateral malleolar sulcus
    - Fossa of the lateral malleolus

> [!NOTE]
> Malleolus medialis of the tibia and malleolus lateralis of the fibula together form the malleolar fork, which encompasses the talus and forms the upper ankle joint!

## Bands and Joints

The lower leg articulates proximally with the knee joint and distally with the upper ankle joint via the talus (astragalus). The two lower leg bones are relatively rigidly connected through the proximal tibiofibular joint as well as through two syndesmoses (interosseous membrane of the leg and tibiofibular syndesmosis).

### Knee Joint

In the knee joint, the distal femur and the tibial plateau communicate with each other. This joint is discussed under “thigh and knee”.

### Tibiofibular Connections

Tibia and Fibula are in direct contact with each other at their proximal and distal ends through joint-like structures and are additionally connected along the entire shaft length indirectly via the Membrana interossea cruris. The connections can be classified from proximal to distal into the following structures: Articulatio tibiofibularis, Membrana interossea cruris, and Syndesmosis tibiofibularis.

#### Tibiofibular joint

- Definition: Proximal Tibiofibular Joint
- Function: Minor sliding movements along the sagittal axis anterior/posterior
- Joint type: Amphiarthrosis (tight true joint)
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Lateral condyle of the tibia
        - Head of the fibula
    - Soft tissue
        - Anterior ligament of the fibular head
        - Posterior ligament of the fibular head

#### Interosseous membrane of the leg

- Definition: Dense connective tissue membrane made of collagen fibers between the tibia and the fibula shaft
- Function
    - Stability
    - Compartmentalization: Together with the intermuscular septa, it forms the muscle compartments in the lower leg and thus serves as the origin for the extensors and deep flexors.
- Type of bone connection: Syndesmosis
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Tibia shaft
        - Fibula shaft
    - Soft tissue
        - Dense collagenous connective tissue (main component of the interosseous membrane of the leg)
- Special feature: A./Anterior tibial veins pass through the interosseous membrane in the proximal third, thus moving from the flexor compartment to the extensor compartment.

#### Tibiofibular syndesmosis

- Definition: Distal tibiofibular joint between the tibia epiphysis and fibula
- Function: Connection of the two bones to the malleolar fork → Stabilization of the upper ankle joint
- Joint Type: Syndesmosis
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Distal-lateral Tibia
        - Distal-medial Fibula
    - Soft tissue
        - Syndesmosis ligaments
            - Anterior tibiofibular ligament
            - Posterior tibiofibular ligament
        - Interosseous membrane of the leg

> [!NOTE] Weber fractures
> Fractures of the lateral malleolus of the fibula are referred to as Weber fractures. For the precise classification, the syndesmotic ligaments play a crucial role: Depending on whether the fibula is fractured below, at, or above the syndesmotic ligaments, it is classified as a Weber-A-, Weber-B-, or Weber-C fracture. Here, it holds that in Weber-A-fractures, the syndesmosis remains intact, whereas in Weber-B-fractures, it can be intact or torn. In the case of Weber-C fractures, the syndesmosis is always torn. The condition of the syndesmosis is crucial for the stability of the fracture.

### Ankles

The malleolar fork of the lower leg articulates with the talus in the upper ankle joint. It forms a functional unit with the lower ankle joint. Both joints are discussed under “foot and ankle joints”.
## Muscles

### Compartments and Muscle Groups of the Lower Leg

The muscular lower leg is divided into three compartments by the membrana interossea cruris, the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa of the leg, and the fascia of the leg, which are further subdivided into a total of four muscle compartments:

- Previous Compartments: Extensor Loge of the Lower Leg (see: Extensors of the Lower Leg)
- Lateral Compartment: Fibularis compartment (see: Muscles of the Fibularis group)
- Posterior compartment: Further divided by the deep layer of the fascia cruris (lower leg fascia) into:
    - Superficial part: Superficial flexor compartment of the lower leg (see: Superficial flexors of the lower leg)
    - Pars profunda: Deep flexor compartment of the lower leg (see: Deep flexors of the lower leg)

> [!NOTE] Compartment syndrome
> The lower leg compartments are completely enclosed, tunnel-like spaces. Within them run the corresponding muscle groups, as well as the associated vascular-nerve bundles. If there is an increase in volume in the compartment due to overuse, ischemia, or fracture and resulting edema or bleeding, nerves can be compressed and, in the worst case, permanently damaged. If the extensor compartment is affected by the deep fibular nerve, the tibialis anterior syndrome occurs: key symptoms include acute loss of toe extension and lack of sensation in the first web space. Therapeutically, an emergency operation is performed to "split" the affected compartment by opening the constricting fascia cruris, thereby relieving the affected nerve.

### Extensors of the Lower Leg

The muscles of the extensors (stretcher) are arranged in the table from tibial to fibular. At the same time, this order also corresponds to the muscle arrangement from ventral to dorsal.

### Fibularis Group

The muscles of the fibularis or calf muscle group are arranged in the table from ventral (superficial) to dorsal (deep).

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|Auxiliary Structures of the Muscles|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. fibularis longus|- Fibula<br>    - Head<br>    - Lateral surface<br>- Intermuscular septa|- Medial cuneiform bone<br>- Metatarsal bone I|- Talocrural joint: Plantarflexion<br>- Subtalar joint: Pronation (Eversion)|- Superficial fibular nerve (L5–S1)|- Tendon sheaths (Vaginae tendinum)<br>- Superior fibular retinaculum<br>- Inferior fibular retinaculum|- Strongest pronator in subtalar joint<br>- Additionally tenses the foot-Transverse arch<br>- Anatomical variant: Os peroneum|
|M. fibularis brevis|- Fibula: Lateral surface<br>- Intermuscular septa|- Metatarsal bone V|-|
|Abbreviations: OSG = upper ankle joint, USG = lower ankle joint|   |   |   |   |   |   |

> [!NOTE]
> The N. fibularis superficialis innervates the entire fibularis group, while the N. fibularis profundus innervates all the extensors!

### Superficial Flexors of the Lower Leg

The superficial flexors (or flexors) consist of two muscles: the M. triceps surae and the M. plantaris. However, only the M. triceps surae has functional significance; its muscular belly shapes and defines the contour and volume of the calf ("surae" from Latin sura = calf). It is composed of the two component muscles, Musculus gastrocnemius and Musculus soleus, which have separate origins but share a common tendon insertion (Achilles tendon).

|Name|   |Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. triceps surae|M. gastrocnemius|- Medial head: Medial femoral condyle<br>- Lateral head: Lateral femoral condyle|- Calcaneus (Tuber calcanei) via the "Achilles tendon"|- Only M. gastrocnemius: Flexion at the knee joint<br>- All three muscle heads<br>    - Talocrural joint: Plantarflexion<br>    - Subtalar joint: Supination (Inversion)|- N. tibialis (S1–S2)|- Large muscle cross-section<br>- Long lever arm in the talocrural joint<br>- Strongest flexor in the talocrural joint<br>- Strongest supinator in the subtalar joint<br>- Key muscle of segment S1|
|M. soleus|- Tibia (Soleus muscle line)<br>- Fibula (upper third of the posterior surface)<br>- Tendinous arch of the soleus muscle|
|M. plantaris|   |- Femur (Lateral supracondylar line)|- Calcaneus (Calcaneal tuberosity)|- Minor cross-section → Little functional relevance<br>    - Knee joint: Flexion, Internal rotation (when the knee is flexed)<br>    - Talocrural joint: Plantarflexion<br>    - Subtalar joint: Supination (Inversion)|- Absent in about 5% of people → Without functional consequence<br>- Long tendon → Suitable for tendon grafts|
|Abbreviations: OSG = upper ankle joint, USG = lower ankle joint, US = lower leg|   |   |   |   |   |   |

> [!NOTE]
> The gastrocnemius muscle acts on the knee and ankle joints, while the soleus muscle only influences the ankle joints!

> [!NOTE] Achilles tendon rupture
> The Achilles tendon can tear due to degenerative causes or through trauma – sometimes even audibly with a bang. In the case of a complete rupture, the dominance of the M. triceps surae at the ankle joint becomes evident: Walking on flat ground is significantly impaired, and climbing stairs or walking uphill becomes nearly impossible. Therapeutically, the rupture is usually treated surgically by tendon repair, or less commonly conservatively with a lower leg cast in a plantar flexion position.

### Deep Flexors of the Lower Leg

The group of deep flexors (flexors) lies ventrally to the M. triceps surae and consists of three muscles. All deep flexors act on the ankle joints, with the M. flexor digitorum longus and M. flexor hallucis longus also serving as toe flexors. The muscles are arranged in the table from tibial to fibular. The deep flexors exhibit two tendon crossings as a topographical peculiarity: the Chiasma crurale in the lower leg and the Chiasma plantare on the sole of the foot.

- Crural chiasm
    - Location: Medial malleolus
    - The tendon of the M. flexor digitorum longus crosses over the tendon of the M. tibialis posterior
- Plantar chiasm
    - Location: Sole of the foot (plantar) at the level of the navicular bone
    - The tendon of the M. flexor digitorum longus crosses over the tendon of the M. flexor hallucis longus

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. flexor digitorum longus|- Tibia (Posterior surface and medial margin)<br>- Fascia of the M. tibialis posterior|- Distal phalanges of digits II–V|- Talocrural joint: Plantarflexion<br>- Subtalar joint: Supination (Inversion)<br>- Digits II–V: Flexion of the toe joints|   |- N. tibialis (S1–S2)|- Tendon sheaths (Vaginae tendinum)<br>- Retinaculum of the flexor muscles of the foot (Retinaculum flexorum)<br>- Medial malleolar sulcus|- Involved in the crural chiasm<br>- Involved in the plantar chiasm<br>- Synonym: "M. perforans"<br>- Its tendon of insertion is the origin of the Mm. lumbricales pedis|

It is particularly well-suited because it lies directly beneath the lateral malleolus behind the skin and, being a purely sensory nerve, has no significance for motor function.

> [!NOTE] Varicose
> A varicose vein refers to the sack-shaped enlargement of a skin vein ("varicose vein"), which is commonly found in the superficial veins of the lower extremity with age. Possible causes include venous valve insufficiency or an outflow obstruction, for example, in the case of deep vein thrombosis. Affected individuals suffer from feelings of heaviness and tension or nighttime leg cramps due to edemas. Complications such as inflammation or thrombosis within the varicose vein can also occur. Wearing compression stockings can provide relief, while in advanced stages, sclerotherapy (hardening) or surgical removal of the varicose veins is the treatment of choice.

> [!NOTE] Fibularis lesion
> The N. fibularis is particularly susceptible to injuries at the fibular head due to its superficial course, especially in cases of fracture or compression. Characteristic of this lesion is the so-called rooster or steppage gait: Since the N. fibularis innervates all foot dorsiflexors, its damage leads to the foot's flaccid drooping (so-called foot drop). To still be able to walk, the leg must be particularly flexed at the hip and knee joint to compensate. A weight shift onto the heel, also known as heel standing, is no longer possible for those affected. Additionally, they experience sensory deficits on the dorsum of the foot and the lateral lower leg.

## Review Questions for the Chapter Lower Leg
### Ligaments and Joints

Name the two syndesmotic ligaments! What function do they serve?
- The syndesmosis tibiofibularis is a distal, connective tissue connection between the tibia and fibula and consists of the ligg. tibiofibulares anterius and posterius. It ensures the stability of the upper ankle joint during maximum dorsiflexion of the foot.
Which two muscle groups are separated by the interosseous membrane of the leg and what topographical relationship does it have to the anterior tibial artery?
- The membrana interossea cruris is a connective tissue membrane of the lower leg and separates the extensors from the deep flexors. It is pierced in its proximal part by the a. tibialis anterior, which thereby passes from the flexor compartment into the extensor compartment.

### Muscles

Which two bony structures serve as attachment points for both the Tibialis anterior muscle and the Fibularis longus muscle?
- The mm. fibularis longus and tibialis anterior both insert on the os cuneiforme mediale (inner cuneiform bone) as well as on the os metatarsi I.
Which muscles of the lower leg are involved in the pronation (eversion) of the ankle joint? Which is the strongest pronator?
- The pronation of the lower ankle joint is carried out by the m. extensor digitorum longus and the mm. fibulares tertius, brevis and longus. The latter is the strongest pronator.
Which muscles of the lower leg are involved in the rolling of the foot off the ground?
- The rolling off of the foot from the ground occurs through plantarflexion in the upper ankle joint and in the toes. The flexion of the ankle joint is especially enabled by the m. triceps surae; moreover, the mm. fibulares brevis and longus, the m. tibialis posterior, the m. flexor digitorum longus and the m. flexor hallucis longus are involved. The latter two also cause flexion of the toes.
Which muscle is tested via the Achilles tendon reflex? What movement is typically produced?
- The tendon insertion of the m. soleus, a part of the m. triceps surae, is colloquially also called the "Achilles tendon" and inserts at the heel. A tap on this tendon triggers a stretch reflex (Achilles tendon reflex), in which the m. triceps surae contracts and typically causes plantarflexion and supination of the ankle joint.
What is the so-called plantar chiasm and at what bony structure does it approximately lie?
- The chiasma plantare is a tendon crossing on the sole of the foot and lies approximately at the level of the os naviculare of the tarsal bones. The tendon of the m. flexor digitorum longus crosses here over the tendon of the m. flexor hallucis longus.

### Innervation

Describe the effects of a high lesion of the N. fibularis!
- The n. fibularis innervates all foot dorsiflexors, so that damage results in flaccid dropping of the foot (so-called foot drop weakness). This results in a so-called steppage gait, in which the leg is especially strongly flexed in the hip and knee joints to compensate while walking. Furthermore, affected individuals can no longer stand on their heels and have sensory deficits on the dorsum of the foot and lateral lower leg.
