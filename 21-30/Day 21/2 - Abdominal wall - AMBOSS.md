# Abdominal wall
## Summary

The abdominal wall surrounds the abdominal cavity and the pelvic cavity with the contained organs. It must adapt to changing volumes, as the organs can take up varying amounts of space depending on various factors (food intake, pregnancy, etc.). The intra-abdominal pressure also changes constantly, for example, due to breathing activity or the so-called abdominal press. The abdominal wall is primarily made up of muscles and thus ensures, together with the back and hip muscles, trunk movement and stabilization.

### Abdominal Press

- Involved structures: abdominal muscles, diaphragm, larynx
- Mechanism: Contraction of the abdominal muscles and diaphragm as well as closure of the vocal cords (or vocal fold) of the larynx.
- Effect: Increase in intra-abdominal pressure with transfer to the abdominal organs
- Function: Support for the expulsion of the contents of the abdominal organs (e.g., defecation, childbirth)
## Tendons and Fascia

### Linea alba and rectus sheath

#### White line

- Definition: Striae in the middle of the abdominal wall
- Origin: Interweaving of the aponeuroses of the lateral abdominal muscles
- Course: From the symphysis to the xiphoid process of the sternum

> [!NOTE]
> At the belly button, the skin is fused with the linea alba without subcutaneous fat tissue, creating the visible navel depression!

> [!NOTE] Umbilical hernia
> An umbilical hernia (navel hernia) describes a bulging of abdominal contents (large intestine or small intestine) through the abdominal wall in the area of the navel. The incorporated layers of the abdominal wall (that are not torn) form a covering called the hernial sac. Such hernias occur particularly frequently in the area of the linea alba, as here there are no muscles, but only connective tissue fibers holding the abdominal wall together. The contents of the hernial sac can be particularly clearly seen when the abdominal press is engaged. Patients often do not experience pain; however, there can be pinching of the intestinal sections in the hernial sac, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the affected section of the intestine, potentially resulting in necrosis or even intestinal perforation. Therefore, a hernia generally needs to be surgically repaired.

#### Rectus sheath

- Definition: Sheath made of the aponeuroses of the lateral abdominal muscles that surrounds the rectus abdominis muscle and lies lateral to the linea alba above and below the navel.
    - External aponeurosis: Aponeurosis of the external oblique abdominal muscle
    - Internusaponeurose: Aponeurosis of the internal abdominal oblique muscle
    - Transversus aponeurosis: Aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis muscle
- Function: Prevents lateral deviation of the M. rectus abdominis
- Structure: Front and back sheet
    - Above the arcuate line
        - Front sheet: External aponeurosis and anterior fibers of the internal aponeurosis
        - Posterior leaflet: Transversus aponeurosis, posterior fibers of the internal aponeurosis, transversalis fascia, and peritoneum
    - Below the arcuate line
        - Front sheet: External, Internal, and Transverse Aponeurosis
        - Posterior sheet: Transversalis fascia and peritoneum

> [!NOTE] Rectus diastasis
> If the intra-abdominal pressure is elevated for an extended period (e.g., during pregnancy or severe obesity), it can lead to a separation of the right and left halves of the rectus abdominis muscle. Normally, this is prevented by the rectus sheath. As a result, the intra-abdominal organs bulge outward. However, since there is no fascial gap and the muscles separate extensively, there is generally no risk of organ incarceration. For this reason, it is not defined as a hernia and is usually treated conservatively, i.e., without surgery (e.g., physiotherapy).

### Fascia

- Superficial fascia: Superficial abdominal fascia
    - Covers the muscular abdominal wall from the outside and stabilizes it
    - Lies directly beneath the subcutaneous fat tissue.
    - Fused with the linea alba and in the inguinal ligament
    - Passes distally from the inguinal ligament into the fascia lata (fascia of the thigh)
- Deep fascia: Transversalis fascia
    - Inner fascia of the transversus abdominis muscle and inner covering of the anterior and posterior abdominal wall
## Strapping Band and Strapping Channel

### Inguinal ligament (Ligamentum inguinale)

- Course: From the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle
- Radiating structures
    - From the outside: External aponeurosis, superficial abdominal fascia, fascia lata
    - From the inside: Transversalis fascia, Parietal pelvic fascia
- Arcus iliopectineus: Tendinous extension that branches caudally from the inguinal ligament, creating two gaps (Lacuna vasorum and Lacuna musculorum) through which vessels and nerves pass from the trunk to the leg.

### Inguinal Canal (Canalis inguinalis)

The inguinal canal serves as a connection between the inner and outer abdominal wall.

- Course: Begins in the abdominal cavity cranially/laterally and runs caudally/medially towards the abdominal wall.
- Length: approx. 4–5 cm
- Location: Between the transversalis fascia and the external aponeurosis above the inguinal ligament
- Content
    - N. ilioinguinalis
    - R. genitalis of the genitofemoral nerve
    - Woman: Round ligament of the uterus
    - Man: Spermatic cord (Funiculus spermaticus)
- Limitations
    - Cranial: Lower edge of the internal oblique abdominal muscle and the transverse abdominal muscle
    - Caudal: Ligamentum inguinale
    - Ventral: Superficial abdominal fascia with external aponeurosis
    - Dorsal: Transversalis fascia and parietal peritoneum
- Openings
    - Deep inguinal ring (Anulus inguinalis profundus): "Entrance" of the inguinal canal
        - Location: Cranial/lateral in the inner abdominal wall and lateral to the A. and V. epigastrica inferior
        - Formative structures: Protrusion of the transversalis fascia
        - Limitations
            - Lateral/cranial: Lower edge of the internal oblique abdominal muscle
            - Lateral/caudal: Inguinal ligament
            - Medial: Interfoveolar ligament
    - External inguinal ring (Anulus inguinalis superficialis): "Exit" of the inguinal canal
        - Location: Caudal/medial in the outer abdominal wall and medial to the A. and V. epigastrica inferior
        - Formative structures: Slit in the external aponeurosis
        - Limitations
            - Cranial: Medial crus (Phase pull of the external aponeurosis)
            - Caudal: Lateral crus (fiber traction of the external aponeurosis)
            - Lateral: Intercrural fibers
            - Medial: Inguinal falx (tendon plate)
- Reinforcement of the inguinal canal: The transversalis fascia is reinforced in the area between the external and internal inguinal rings by the interfoveolar ligament.

> [!NOTE]
> The outer inguinal ring (and in men, the spermatic cord that leaves it) is palpable from the outside!

> [!NOTE] Femoral hernia
> A femoral hernia refers to the displacement of organs through the lacuna vasorum. The hernial sac protrudes below the inguinal ligament, medial to the passage of the femoral artery and vein, and lateral to the lacunar ligament, and is often difficult to palpate. Affected individuals usually only show symptoms when the displaced section of the intestine is no longer adequately supplied with blood due to incarceration in the hernial sac.

> [!NOTE] Inguinal hernia
> The inguinal hernia is the most common form of hernia. It involves a protrusion of the peritoneum and possibly intra-abdominal structures through a weakness in the abdominal wall in the groin area. A direct (medial) inguinal hernia is distinguished from an indirect (lateral) inguinal hernia. The direct inguinal hernia is located medial to the epigastric vessels and runs from the medial inguinal fossa (internal hernia opening) to the external inguinal ring (external hernia opening). The hernia sac penetrates the transversalis fascia directly (without relation to the spermatic cord). The indirect inguinal hernia is located lateral to the epigastric vessels and runs from the lateral inguinal fossa (internal hernia opening) through the inguinal canal to the external inguinal ring (external hernia opening). The physical examination is the most important criterion for diagnosing an inguinal hernia. In men, it can be palpated while standing through the scrotal skin up to the external inguinal ring. If the patient is then asked to cough, the so-called cough impulse (bulging of the hernia sac due to intra-abdominal pressure when coughing) can be felt.

## Conduction Pathways

The largest part of the abdominal wall is supplied by the vascular pathways of the thorax.

## Topography of the Abdominal Wall

The abdominal wall is divided into a front and a lateral area and extends from the rib cage to the anterior iliac crest, the inguinal ligament, and the symphysis. The superficial abdominal wall can be divided into four quadrants or nine regions.

### Division of the Abdominal Wall

#### Division into four quadrants

Through two lines that stand perpendicular to each other at the navel, the abdominal wall is divided into the following quadrants:

1. Right upper quadrant
2. Linker upper quadrant
3. Right lower quadrant
4. Left lower quadrant

- In addition, a periumbilical region

#### Nine Regions

The abdominal wall is divided into the following regions by two vertical and two horizontal lines:

1. Right hypochondriac region
2. Epigastric region
3. Left hypochondriac region
4. Right lumbar region
5. Umbilical region
6. Left lumbar region
7. Right inguinal region
8. Pubic region
9. Left inguinal region

> [!NOTE] Division of the abdominal wall in the context of the physical examination
> The physical examination of the abdomen should always be performed in a specific order: First, there is always inspection, that is, the observation of the abdomen. During this, certain changes such as scars, bulges, etc. may already be observed. This is followed by auscultation, and only then percussion and palpation, in order to prevent distortion of bowel sounds due to previous palpatory stimulation. In order to establish anatomical references for the results of all examination steps and subsequently create a comprehensible report, the abdomen is divided into quadrants during the clinical examination. Thus, pain in the right upper quadrant may indicate issues in the liver or gallbladder, and pain in the right lower quadrant may suggest appendicitis ("inflammation of the appendix"). For an even more differentiated description of findings during the examination of the abdominal organs, the abdomen can also be divided into nine sectors. Here, the upper abdomen (epigastrium), the middle abdomen (mesogastrium), and the lower abdomen (hypogastrium) are each considered in thirds.

### Projection of the Abdominal Organs

- Stomach: Epigastric region and partly left hypochondriac region
- Liver/Gallbladder: Right hypochondriac region, epigastric region, and partially extending to the left hypochondriac region.
- Small intestine: Entire middle and lower abdomen
- Colon
    - Cecum and Appendix: Right Lower Abdomen
    - Colon: Mid and lower abdomen
- Spleen: Links between the 9th and 11th ribs
- Bladder: Pubic region

#### Head's Zones

The so-called Head zones are skin areas that have a nerve relationship with specific organs. If the organ is diseased, it can lead to pain in the corresponding skin area.
## Review Questions for the Chapter on Abdominal Wall
### Muscles

Where does the external oblique muscle originate and how do its fibers run?
- The M. obliquus externus originates as the outermost abdominal wall muscle laterally on the cartilaginous outer surface of ribs 5–12 and runs obliquely downward/medially.
What effect does unilateral contraction of the external oblique muscle have, and what about bilateral contraction?
- Unilateral contraction of the M. obliquus externus causes lateral flexion of the trunk to the ipsilateral side and rotation of the trunk to the contralateral side. Bilateral contraction, however, causes ventral flexion of the trunk or straightening of the trunk from a supine position and straightening of the pelvis. Additionally, this supports the abdominal press and forced expiration.
From which muscle does the cremaster muscle split off?
- For the M. cremaster, some fibers split off from the M. obliquus internus at the lower edge and run into the scrotum.
What is the abdominal press and what mechanisms enable it?
- The abdominal press increases intra-abdominal pressure and thereby helps to expel the contents of abdominal organs (e.g., defecation, birth). It is achieved through contraction of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm. Additionally, the glottis closes.

### Tendons and Fascia

What parts does the posterior layer of the rectus sheath consist of?
- The posterior layer of the rectus sheath consists, above the linea arcuata, of the transverse aponeurosis, the posterior fibers of the internal oblique aponeurosis, the transversalis fascia, and the peritoneum. Below the linea arcuata, it consists of transversalis fascia and peritoneum.
Where is the superficial fascia of the abdominal wall located?
- The superficial fascia (= Fascia abdominalis superficialis) lies directly beneath the subcutaneous fat tissue and covers the muscular abdominal wall in a stabilizing manner.

### Trim band and trim channel

Where are the internal and external inguinal rings located in relation to the epigastric vessels?
- The internal inguinal ring lies lateral to the inferior epigastric artery and vein, the external inguinal ring medial.
Where is the break point of the direct inguinal hernia? Where is that of the indirect?
- Both the direct and the indirect inguinal hernias pass through the external inguinal ring (= Anulus inguinalis superficialis). The direct inguinal hernia, however, has its rupture portal medial to the epigastric vessels, while the indirect inguinal hernia passes through the internal inguinal ring (= Anulus inguinalis profundus) lateral to the epigastric vessels through the abdominal wall.
Where is the rupture portal of groin hernias?
- Femoral hernias occur below the inguinal ligament, medial to the femoral artery and vein, and lateral to the lacunar ligament.

### Topography

In which nine regions can the outer abdominal wall be divided?
- The outer abdominal wall can be divided into nine regions by two vertical and two horizontal lines. These are, from top to bottom and right to left: 1. Right hypochondriac region, 2. Epigastric region, 3. Left hypochondriac region, 4. Right lumbar region, 5. Umbilical region, 6. Left lumbar region, 7. Right inguinal region, 8. Pubic region, and 9. Left inguinal region.
