# Autonomic Nervous System
## Summary

The autonomic nervous system is capable of adjusting our body to different life situations without conscious control from the brain. It distinguishes between a sympathetic component and a parasympathetic component, which complement each other in their effects on the organs. While the sympathetic nervous system takes on the activation-promoting part, the parasympathetic nervous system plays a role in inhibiting activation. The transmission of information about the state of an organ occurs via afferents to the central nervous system, where the information is processed and sent back to the organ via efferents. Norepinephrine and acetylcholine play a crucial role as transmitters in signal transmission. However, many autonomic reactions are already organized at the spinal cord level in reflex arcs and bypass the brain. Nevertheless, they are also subject to central control by higher-order centers (e.g., limbic system, hypothalamus, brainstem, spinal cord).

In addition to the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system, there is the enteric nervous system, which is specifically responsible for the digestive system and can be considered a separate nervous system, although it is influenced by the CNS. It is discussed in the chapter Overview of the Digestive System.
## General

The vegetative nervous system is also called the autonomic nervous system and regulates a large part of our vital bodily functions without our conscious control: circulation, breathing, digestion, etc. It is divided into two usually antagonistically acting systems: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic. The sympathetic primarily has a function of increasing activity, while the parasympathetic dominates during rest phases. Nevertheless, parasympathetic activity can also occur in stressful situations.
## Basics

The transmitters in the vegetative nervous system are acetylcholine and the catecholamines norepinephrine and epinephrine. While the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic as well as the parasympathetic use acetylcholine as a transmitter, the transmitters of the postganglionic neurons differ. Thus, norepinephrine is the transmitter of the postganglionic sympathetic fibers and acetylcholine is that of the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers. Additionally, cotransmitters play a role in the modulation of the synapses.

## Transmitters and Receptors

The preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems use acetylcholine for signal transduction, which binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors on the postsynapse. In the case of the postganglionic neurons, there is an important difference: Here, norepinephrine serves as the neurotransmitter of the sympathetic system; it binds to adrenergic receptors of the target organs. In contrast, for the parasympathetic system, acetylcholine again acts as the transmitter.

- Signal transduction preganglionic neuron → postganglionic neuron
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
    - Receptors: Nicotinic Cholinoreceptors
- Signal transduction postganglionic neuron → target organ
    - Sympathetic Nervous System
        - Transmitter: Norepinephrine
        - Receptors: Adrenergic receptors
        - Exceptions
            - Sweat glands: Stimulation occurs via muscarinic cholinergic receptors (Transmitter: Acetylcholine; Parasympatholytics such as Atropine act as inhibitors on sweat glands)
            - Adrenal Medulla: Stimulation occurs directly, i.e., without ganglionic transmission, via nicotinic cholinoreceptors (transmitter: acetylcholine) and leads to the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline by the adrenal medulla
    - Parasympathetic Nervous System
        - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
        - Receptors: Muscarinic Cholinergic Receptors

### Receptors

One distinguishes cholinergic receptors from adrenergic receptors, which are further divided into subtypes.

#### Cholin receptors

## Control and Switching

### Central Control Centers

The control of the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system occurs in centers of the CNS, which are hierarchically organized and interconnected through feedback mechanisms. The limbic system is the highest center, while the spinal cord is the lowest.

1. Limbic System: Emotional Drive
2. Hypothalamus
    - Most important regulatory center of vegetative functions
    - Regulates, for example, body temperature and food intake and maintains the internal environment (homeostasis: blood pressure, temperature, osmolarity)
    - Controls the hormone secretion of the pituitary gland
3. Medulla oblongata (Reticular formation): Regulation of circulation and breathing as well as rapid adjustment of these functions to meet demand.
4. Spinal Cord: Control of Spinal Reflexes
5. Target organ: Execution of the transmitted, vegetative signal

### Vegetative Nerve Pathway

- Components: Two neurons connected in series, which are switched in the autonomic ganglia.
    - 1. Neuron: Cell body in the autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic centers in the thoracolumbar or sacral spinal cord
    - 2. Neuron: Cell body in the autonomic ganglia
- Vegetative Ganglia
    - Contain exclusively multipolar neurons
    - Switching station of the vegetative neurons (= inter-neuronal switching)
    - Sympathetic ganglia are located near the spinal cord.
        - Paravertebral chain (paravertebral ganglia) along the spine
        - Prevertebral ganglia near the major abdominal arteries
    - Parasympathetic ganglia are located near or within the wall of their target organ.
        - 4 Head ganglia
            - Ciliary ganglion behind the eye
            - Pterygopalatine ganglion in the pterygopalatine fossa
            - Submandibular ganglion at the submandibular gland
            - Otic ganglion at the base of the skull
        - Numerous other organ-related ganglia, where the fibers of the vagus nerve as well as the sacral component are switched.

#### Special Feature: Paraganglia

Paraganglia are a cluster of endocrine active cells that function as neural switch stations (ganglia). Unlike "classical" vegetative ganglia, their neurotransmitter is not directly released to a target organ, but rather into the bloodstream. They form an interface between the vegetative nervous system and the endocrine system. Typically, chromaffin sympathetic paraganglia are distinguished from weakly to non-chromaffin parasympathetic paraganglia based on their staining behavior with chrom salts. Embryologically, both arise from the neural crest.

##### Sympathetic Paraganglia

- Definition: Small groups of chromaffin parenchymal cells that usually regress in childhood.
- Localization: Retroperitoneal
    - Partially with constant localizations, e.g. the abdominal aortic paraganglion at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery
    - Partially irregularly distributed, especially located paraaortally
- Function: Catecholamine production

> [!NOTE]
> Functionally, the adrenal medulla is considered the largest paraganglion!

> [!NOTE] Pheochromocytoma
> Since the paraganglia develop from sympathetic neuroblasts like the adrenal medulla, they have the ability for catecholamine synthesis. As in the adrenal medulla, catecholamine-producing tumors can also develop from paraganglia. Clinically, these manifest like the pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla, for example, with significantly elevated blood pressure values and headaches.

##### Parasympathetic Paraganglia

- Definition: Accumulation mainly of non-chromaffin parenchymal cells
- Localization: Head and neck region
    - Glomus caroticum: Carotid bifurcation
    - Glomus aorticum: Aortic arch
    - Glomus jugulare: skull base (jugular fossa)
    - Glomus tympanicum: Ear (Tympanic cavity)
- Function: Circulatory-regulating chemoreceptors, which measure the partial pressures and pH of the arterial blood

> [!NOTE] Paraganglioma
> Paragangliomas of the head and neck region are rare, slowly growing endocrine tumors. They are usually benign and depending on their location, they produce typical symptoms. For example, the glomus tympanicum paraganglioma leads to hearing loss and tinnitus.

## Plexus of the Autonomic Nervous System

Nerve fibers of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system aggregate into organ-associated nerve networks, which are referred to as vegetative plexuses. They are typically located near the large arteries of the neck and chest area as well as the abdomen. The different plexuses are closely interconnected, and a precise separation of the conduction pathways is not always possible.

The switching of the sympathetic fibers for the abdominal and pelvic organs to the postganglionic 2nd neuron occurs in the prevertebral ganglia that are associated with the plexus. However, since the sympathetic fibers of the cervical and thoracic regions are already switched in the sympathetic chain ganglia, no additional ganglia are found in the plexus.

## Sympathetic Nervous System

The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the autonomic nervous system that usually has an ergotropic effect, meaning it increases the body's readiness for action during actual or perceived stress. Its neurons are distributed throughout the body.

### Anatomy

#### Course of the sympathetic neurons

All sympathetic neurons follow the same path up to the ganglion chain, from there the pathway differs for the individual innervation areas.

##### Shared History

- The cell bodies of the preganglionic neurons are located in the Ncl. intermediolateralis in the lateral horn of the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord at the level of the spinal cord segments C8–L3.
- Preganglionic fibers leave as part of the spinal nerve the spinal cord via the ventral root (anterior root) at the level of the segment
- They separate shortly thereafter from the spinal nerve and travel as R. communicans albus to the sympathetic ganglia.

##### Course of the sympathetic fibers for head, thoracic organs, skin and extremities

- In spinal cord: Switching to postganglionic neurons
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
- Postganglionic fibers travel back to the spinal nerves via the gray communicating ramus
- They then reach their target organ as part of a somatic nerve.
    - Transmitter: Norepinephrine

##### Course of the sympathetic fibers for abdominal and pelvic organs

- They travel through the border branch without being interconnected and reach the abdominal and pelvic organs as visceral nerves directly.
- Switching to postganglionic neurons in
    - Prevertebral ganglia: Are grouped around the large vessels in the abdominal cavity (celiac trunk, renal arteries, superior mesenteric artery)
        - Celiac ganglion, Superior mesenteric ganglion, Inferior mesenteric ganglion, Aorticorenal ganglion
    - Organnahe Ganglia: Located near the organs to be supplied
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
- Further transport to the target organ
    - Transmitter: Norepinephrine

> [!NOTE]
> The visceral organ nerves, such as the splanchnic nerves, are preganglionic, meaning they are not yet synapsed sympathetic nerves!

##### Course of the sympathetic fibers to the adrenal medulla

- Preganglionic fibers travel directly to the adrenal medulla and are switched to neuroendocrine cells there.
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
- The neuroendocrine cells then release their transmitter as a hormone into the blood.
    - Transmitter: 80% Adrenaline, 20% Norepinephrine

#### Sympathetic trunk (Truncus sympathicus)

The sympathetic trunk consists of 22 paired ganglia that extend along the entire spine from the base of the skull to the coccyx on both the right and left sides. Distally, both trunks converge at the ganglion impar located at the coccyx; otherwise, they are connected by Rr. interganglionares.

|Ganglion|Name and Characteristics|Innervation Area|
|---|---|---|
|Cervical ganglia|- Fibers from C8–Th1<br>    - Superior cervical ganglion<br>    - Middle cervical ganglion<br>    - Inferior cervical ganglion<br>        - Stellate ganglion: Fusion of inferior cervical ganglion and the first thoracic ganglion|- Head<br>- Chest and thoracic organs|
|Thoracic Ganglia|- Fibers from Th1–Th12 form 11–12 thoracic ganglia<br>    - Fibers from segments Th5–Th9 form the greater splanchnic nerve → Continuation to the celiac ganglion<br>    - Fibers from segments Th10–Th12 form the lesser splanchnic nerve → Continuation to the superior mesenteric ganglion and inferior mesenteric ganglion|- Trunk (Skin)<br>- Abdominal organs|
|Lumbar Ganglia|- Fibers from L1–L2 form 4 lumbar ganglia<br>    - Fibers from the segments L1–L2 form the lumbar splanchnic nerves → Further connection to the inferior mesenteric ganglion|- Abdominal and pelvic organs|
|Coccygeal ganglia|- Fibers from Th11–L3 form three to five sacral ganglia: From these, the sacral splanchnic nerves arise<br>- Impar ganglion: An unpaired ganglion in front of the coccyx, where the right and left sympathetic trunk converge|

### Effect

The target tissue of the sympathetic nervous system is primarily the smooth muscle of glands and blood vessels, which is associated with an influence on peripheral resistance. In general, its role is to prepare the body for action. For the specific functions, see the table in the subsection "Overview of Effects."

> [!NOTE] Horner Syndrome  
> The Horner syndrome is a symptom complex caused by damage to cervical sympathetic nerve fibers. The causes can lie anywhere along the course of the corresponding fibers and can be, for example, space-occupying lesions in the neck area and mediastinum (e.g., Pancoast tumor at the lung apex, carotid dissection). On the affected side, the eyelid (ptosis due to the failure of the M. tarsalis superior), the pupil is constricted (miosis due to the failure of the M. dilatator pupillae), and sweating is impaired (anhidrosis). Additionally, due to a higher position of the lower eyelid, the eyeball appears sunken (so-called pseudo-enophthalmos).

## Parasympathetic Nervous System

The parasympathetic nervous system is the counterpart of the sympathetic nervous system and is primarily active during rest phases. It regulates bodily functions that stimulate metabolism and promote recovery. This effect is referred to as trophotropic. Parasympathetic neurons are mainly found in the internal organs (from the head to the pelvis).

### Anatomy

#### Course of the parasympathetic neurons

The cell bodies of the preganglionic neurons are located cranially in the brainstem (in the cranial nerve nuclei) and in the sacral spinal cord.

##### Course of the cranial portion

- Preganglionic fibers extend from the cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem to parasympathetic ganglia, where the synapse occurs on the postganglionic neuron.
    - Ncl. oculomotorius accessorius (Edinger-Westphal) → N. oculomotorius → Ciliary ganglion (Pupil muscles)
    - Ncl. salivatorius superior → Facial Nerve → Pterygopalatine Ganglion, Submandibular Ganglion
    - Ncl. salivatorius inferior → N. glossopharyngeus → Otic ganglion
    - Ncl. dorsalis n. vagi → N. vagus → Organ nodes ganglia in the chest and abdominal cavity up to the Cannon-Böhm point at the left colon flexure
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
- Postganglionic fibers run from the ganglia to the target organs.
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine

##### Course of the sacred share

- Preganglionic fibers extend from the lateral horns of the spinal cord segments S2–S4 to parasympathetic ganglia, where the synapse occurs with the postganglionic neuron.
    - Ncll. parasympathici → Pelvic splanchnic nerves → Organ connection Ganglia
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine
- Postganglionic fibers travel from the ganglia to the target organs (descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, kidney, bladder, reproductive organs)
    - Transmitter: Acetylcholine

### Effect

Target tissues of the parasympathetic nervous system are primarily the smooth muscle of organs and glandular cells of the gastrointestinal tract, the excretory and sexual organs, and the lungs. Aside from the arteries of the sexual organs and a few of the facial skin, the brain, and the intestinal mucosa, the parasympathetic nervous system has no direct influence on vascular tone but is involved in the innervation of the salivary and tear glands and the heart's conduction system.

> [!NOTE] Vasovagal Syncope
> As a vasovagal syncope, it is referred to an increased parasympathetic tone, where a significant dilation of the vessels occurs due to decreased sympathetic activity. At the same time, the vagus nerve mediates bradycardia. The blood "pooling" occurs, the brain becomes underperfused, and there is a brief loss of consciousness. Causes can be psychological, neurogenic, or cardiac. A popular diagnostic tool is the tilt table test. Patients are passively elevated from a lying position for about 10 minutes. If a loss of consciousness occurs, the test is positive and therefore pathogenic. In unremarkable patients, the heart rate reflexively increases slightly to counteract the temporary hypotension – the individuals remain fully conscious.

## Overview of Effects

Sympathetic nervous system and Parasympathetic nervous system mediate numerous, sometimes antagonistic effects on their target organs. In general, the Sympathetic nervous system tends to enhance performance, while the Parasympathetic nervous system is active during resting phases. The most important effects are presented in the following table.

|Brown Adipose Tissue|- β3: Thermogenesis|- (none)|
## Review Questions on the Chapter Autonomic Nervous System
### General

What are the transmitters of the pre- and postganglionic neurons of the autonomic nervous system?
- The preganglionic transmitter of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is acetylcholine, which is also released by the postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system. Postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, on the other hand, use norepinephrine.

Which receptor type do the adrenergic receptors belong to? Describe the signal cascade that is triggered by the binding of epinephrine or norepinephrine to the α1-adrenergic receptor of a vascular smooth muscle cell.
- All adrenergic receptors (α1, α2, β1–β3) belong to the G-protein-coupled receptors. When adrenaline or norepinephrine binds, for example, to the α1-adrenergic receptor of a vascular smooth muscle cell, its G-protein is activated and stimulates phospholipase C. Through further steps, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is increased, which leads to contraction of the smooth vascular muscle (vasoconstriction).

What types of cholinoreceptors are there and how do they differ in their functionality?
- Cholinoreceptors are specific receptors for acetylcholine and can be divided into muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The muscarinic or m-cholinoreceptors belong, with their five subtypes (M1–M5), to the G-protein-coupled receptors, whereas the nicotinic or n-acetylcholine receptor is a Na+ channel that opens upon binding acetylcholine and allows sodium influx into the cell.

With the help of which important second messengers does the sympathetic nervous system exert its effect on the bronchi? Describe the signal cascade and its effect.
- β2-adrenergic receptors are located on the smooth bronchial muscle of the airways and primarily bind adrenaline. Via the receptor’s G-protein, intracellular adenylate cyclase is stimulated, leading to increased synthesis of the second messenger cAMP. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which regulates the activity of various proteins through phosphorylations (e.g., myosin light chain kinase) and thereby induces relaxation of the smooth muscle cells (bronchodilation). This facilitates breathing according to the performance-enhancing function of the sympathetic nervous system.

What effect does the parasympathetic nervous system have on the bronchi and through which receptors is this mediated?
- Cholinergic M3 receptors are located on the smooth bronchial muscle of the airways. Binding of acetylcholine as part of parasympathetic activation triggers, via G-protein mediation, bronchoconstriction.

What feature of signal transduction is present in the sweat glands?
- Sweat glands constitute an exception in their innervation: although they are purely sympathetically controlled, the neurotransmitter is acetylcholine and not norepinephrine as normally in the sympathetic nervous system.

Which vegetative nerve plexus is located roughly at the level of the aortic bifurcation?
- The superior hypogastric plexus contains sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers and lies ventral to the vertebral bodies at the level of the aortic bifurcation.

### Sympathetic Nervous System

The preganglionic fibers of which spinal cord segments converge in the cervical part of the sympathetic trunk? What are the names of the ganglia where the switching of these fibers subsequently takes place?
- The cervical part of the sympathetic trunk contains preganglionic fibers from spinal segments C8–Th1. They are switched in the superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglia, or stellate ganglion (fusion of the inferior cervical ganglion and first thoracic ganglion), whose postganglionic fibers innervate numerous structures of the head and chest.

The fibers of which spinal cord segments run in the greater splanchnic nerve? Are they pre- or postganglionic fibers?
- The greater splanchnic nerve refers to the preganglionic portion of the sympathetic nervous system that originates from the ganglia of the sympathetic trunk at Th5–Th9. Its fibers mostly end in the celiac ganglion, where they switch to postganglionic fibers that travel to the target organ.

### Parasympathetic Nervous System

Describe the fundamental course of the sacral component of the parasympathetic nervous system from the perikarya of the 1st neuron to the target organ.
- The perikarya of the first neurons of the sacral parasympathetic nervous system lie in the lateral horns of spinal segments S2–S4. Their preganglionic fibers run as pelvic splanchnic nerves (Nn. splanchnici pelvici) to the organ-near parasympathetic ganglia, where they switch to postganglionic neurons. These fibers then proceed from the ganglia to their respective target organs (e.g., bladder, genital organs).

### Overview of Effects

How do the sympathetic system and parasympathetic system act on the eye?
- If the parasympathetic influence predominates in the eye, there is a constriction of the pupil (miosis); if the sympathetic influence predominates, the pupil dilates (mydriasis).

Name the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart.
- The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for stress by activating the heart. This results in increased heart rate (positive chronotropic), increased contractile force (positive inotropic), increased conduction velocity (positive dromotropic), increased relaxation speed (positive lusitropic), and increased general excitability (positive bathmotropic).

Which part of the autonomic nervous system controls bladder emptying, and what effect must it have on the bladder muscles M. detrusor vesicae and M. sphincter vesicae?
- Bladder emptying is controlled by the parasympathetic nervous system. Activation causes contraction of the detrusor muscle (M. detrusor vesicae, the “bladder emptier”), which increases bladder internal pressure, while relaxation of the sphincter muscle (M. sphincter vesicae, the “bladder sphincter”) opens the bladder toward the urethra.

Which part of the autonomic nervous system causes an erection of the penis and how?
- The erection of the penis is caused by an influx of blood into the corpora cavernosa penis. This is induced by parasympathetically mediated vasodilation of the helicine arteries (Aa. helicinae) there.

What is the purpose of increasing saliva secretion by the parasympathetic nervous system?
- The parasympathetic nervous system is especially active during rest phases, such as during food intake. It stimulates production of watery saliva, which among other things improves food lubrication and supports its breakdown.
