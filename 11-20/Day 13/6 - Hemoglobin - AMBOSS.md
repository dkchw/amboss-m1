# Hemoglobin
## Summary

Hemoglobin is the main protein of erythrocytes. It plays a crucial role in oxygen transport and gives erythrocytes (and thus blood) its characteristic red color in the oxygenated state. It is one of the most well-studied proteins overall. Its biochemical structure, the differences among the various hemoglobin types, as well as the mechanisms of oxygen binding, are of extraordinary importance for the physiology and pathophysiology of oxygen transport and blood circulation: disturbances in this system affect the entire body.
## Hemoglobin Structure

Hemoglobin is a tetramer made up of four globin chains, each of which has a heme molecule bound to it.

### Globin

Globins are a family of proteins characterized by their globular shape and a special pocket, known as the globin pocket. The globin pocket allows for oxygen binding, which represents the main function of globins across species.

- Structure
    - Size: 16 kDa per chain → 64 kDa per tetramer
    - Secondary structure: Rich in α-helices
- Subspecies
    - Are designated with Greek letters: α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ → Responsible for the different hemoglobin types
    - Most important postnatal hemoglobin: HbA0, consisting of two α-globin and two β-globin chains.
- Function
    - Enable regulation of oxygen affinity
    - Prevent autoxidation of neighboring heme groups
    - Buffering of pH level in the blood

### Ham

Heme is a complex compound made up of a porphyrin molecule and an iron ion. It acts, among other things, as a prosthetic group of hemoglobin and facilitates oxygen binding there.

- Structure: Häm consists of a porphyrin ring system, whose side chains have been modified during the synthesis.
    - Porphyrin: Organic compound made up of four pyrrole rings, each connected by a methine group.
        - In the center of the porphyrin ring system lies an iron atom.
- Function: Oxygen binding
- Heme is not only found in hemoglobin but also as a prosthetic group in other proteins, such as myoglobin or cytochrome c.

> [!NOTE]
> Hemoglobin consists of four globin chains, each of which has a heme bound to it!

## Hemoglobin Types and Variants

Different types and variants of hemoglobin can be distinguished. While the types differ based on the globin chains they contain, hemoglobin variants refer to hemoglobin that has been altered post-translationally through reactions – each type can therefore exist in multiple variants!

### Hemoglobin Types

The hemoglobin types differ in the composition of their globin chains. This results in a modulation of oxygen affinity: on one hand, this is important prenatally, and on the other hand, it plays a clinical role in hemoglobinopathies.

- Naming: In short form based on the contained chains, e.g., α2β2 → Two α- and two β-chains
- Adult Hemoglobin (HbA): Synthesis begins during the fetal period and is continued more intensively after birth.
    - HbA0 (>95%): Two α- and two β-chains (α2β2)
        - Oxygen affinity is strongly reduced by 2,3-BPG.
    - HbA1 (≤6%): Glycated HbA0 on the β-chains
        - Actually, not a hemoglobin type, but a hemoglobin variant!
        - Depending on the type of glycation, different subvariants are distinguished, the most common of which is HbA1c.
    - HbA2 (<3%): Two α- and two δ-chains (α2δ2)
- Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF): Two α- and two γ-chains (α2γ2)
    - Predominant hemoglobin type in the embryo, fetus, and newborn
    - Significantly higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin
        - Oxygen affinity is hardly influenced by 2,3-BPG.
    - In adults, only traceable (<1%)
    - Increased in the context of globin synthesis disorders (thalassemia)
- Embryonic hemoglobin: Also contains ε- and ζ-chains
    - Only significant in the first 8 weeks after fertilization
    - Gower 1 (ζ2ε2), Gower 2 (α2ε2), Portland 1 (ζ2γ2), Portland 2 (ζ2β2)
- Hb Barts: Four γ-chains (γ4)
    - Normally only present in traces
    - Increased in synthesis disorder of the α-chains (α-thalassemia)
    - Extremely high O2 affinity → Minimal O2 release possible
- HbH: Four beta chains (β4)
    - Pathological hemoglobin type
    - Especially in the case of synthesis disorders of the α-chains (α-thalassemia)
    - Extremely high O2 affinity → Minimal O2 release possible

> [!NOTE]
> In adults, HbA0 (α2β2) is predominantly present, while fetuses and newborns mainly have HbF (α2γ2), which exhibits a much higher oxygen affinity due to the lack of binding capability to 2,3-BPG!

> [!NOTE]
> "γ goes, β becomes, α always" (freely translated from English: γ disappears, β becomes present, α is always there)!

### Hemoglobin Variants

- Oxygenated/Deoxygenated Hemoglobin
    - Oxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin that has bound oxygen (oxygenated) → Bright red color
    - Deoxyhemoglobin: Hemoglobin that has not bound oxygen (deoxygenated) → Dark red, purple color
- Carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO)
    - Binding of carbon monoxide (CO) to the oxygen binding site of hemoglobin
    - Color: Typically bright red!
- Carbaminohemoglobin
    - Binding of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the N-terminal end of the globin chains → Carbamate binding
- Glycated hemoglobin
    - Irreversible, non-enzymatic attachment of carbohydrates to amino acid residues of hemoglobin (glycation)
    - Clinically most significant glycated hemoglobin: HbA1c
- Methemoglobin (Met-Hb)
    - Oxidation of divalent iron in the heme group (Fe2+) to trivalent iron (Fe3+)
        - Hemoglobin + O2 → Methemoglobin + O2-
        - Can no longer bind oxygen
        - O2 affinity of the other heme groups of the same hemoglobin molecule increases → O2 release is hindered
    - Conversion of methemoglobin back to hemoglobin
        - Reduction of the affected iron ion
            - Through glutathione (enzyme-independent)
            - Through the methemoglobin reductase: 2 Met-Hb + NADH ⇄ 2 Hb + NAD+ + H+

> [!NOTE] CO poisoning
> Carbon monoxide is produced during combustion with insufficient oxygen supply (e.g., in defective stoves or chimney systems) as well as in smoldering fires and is also present in car exhaust. Increased inhalation of carbon monoxide leads to carbon monoxide poisoning, which presents different symptoms depending on the severity and can result in death. The cause is, on one hand, the blockage of hemoglobin, rendering it unavailable for oxygen transport. On the other hand, there is a left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, which means that bound oxygen is released less effectively to the tissues.

> [!NOTE] HbA1c
> The proportion of HbA1c to total hemoglobin is an important diagnostic long-term parameter in diabetes mellitus. The glycation underlying the formation of HbA1c is an irreversible modification – i.e., it persists for the entire lifespan of erythrocytes (approximately 120 days) and is only "reversed" upon their breakdown. The HbA1c proportion therefore indicates the average blood sugar level of the past weeks. A short-term manipulation is impossible. The higher the average glucose concentration over weeks, the higher the HbA1c value will be.

> [!NOTE] Methemoglobinemia
> Due to a deficiency of the enzyme methemoglobin reductase, there can be an increased occurrence of methemoglobin in the blood. This condition is referred to as methemoglobinemia, which can also have other causes. Depending on the severity, the symptoms can vary greatly. At a methemoglobin level of 60–70% in the blood, methemoglobinemia is life-threatening.

## Hemoglobin Synthesis

The synthesis of hemoglobin occurs in erythroblasts. The globin chains and heme are initially synthesized separately from each other.

- Synthesis of globin: According to the general protein biosynthesis at the ribosomes
- Synthesis of Heme: Complicated metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm and mitochondria

### Hemsynthesis

Heme is not only found in hemoglobin but in almost every cell. However, its outstanding importance for oxygen transport in hemoglobin justifies a discussion at this point. An overview of the key steps in the complicated heme synthesis will follow.

- Place
    - Cytoplasm and mitochondria
    - Mainly in erythroblasts for hemoglobin and in hepatocytes for cytochrome c
- Key enzyme: δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthase (δ-ALA-Synthase, δ-Aminolevulinic acid synthase)
    - Regulation: Häm inhibits the transcription and activity of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase.
- Simplified Overview
    - Succinyl-CoA + Glycine → δ-Aminolevulinic acid (Mitochondria), with the release of Coenzyme A
    - 8 δ-Aminolevulinic acid → 4 Porphobilinogen → Porphyrin ring system (cytoplasm)
    - Porphyrin ring system + Fe2+ → Heme

> [!NOTE]
> The key enzyme of heme synthesis is δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase; it requires PALP as a cofactor!

## Hemoglobin Degradation

The breakdown of erythrocytes mainly occurs in macrophages in the red pulp of the spleen. Then, the breakdown of hemoglobin also takes place immediately in these macrophages. If erythrocytes are destroyed outside of macrophages, hemoglobin is first bound to the transport protein haptoglobin and then delivered to the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS).

- Fate of the individual components of hemoglobin
    - Globin: Is broken down into amino acids
    - Haptoglobin: Is reused
    - Eisenion: Is released and recycled
    - Heme: Is broken down into bilirubin and excreted.

### Hemolysis

The breakdown of heme occurs in the macrophages of the monocytic phagocyte system.

1. Heme oxygenase: Consumes NADPH + H+ and O2 and releases CO and Fe2+
    - Opens the porphyrin ring system
    - Requires a cytochrome P450 reductase to transfer electrons from NADPH to heme
    - Blue deoxygenated hemoglobin is metabolized to green biliverdin.
2. Biliverdin reductase: Consumes NADPH + H+
    - Green biliverdin is metabolized into orange bilirubin.

> [!NOTE]
> During the reaction of heme oxygenase, carbon monoxide (CO) is released!

> [!NOTE] Bruises (Hematomas)
> Hematomas that differ significantly in color indicate injuries at different times. Thus, they can be a sign of repeated accidents, an increased tendency to bleed, or abuse. Fresh hematomas are red (oxygenated hemoglobin) and change color over time first to dark red-purple-blue-black (deoxygenated hemoglobin, clotted blood), then green (biliverdin), and finally yellow (bilirubin).

### Bilirubin

Bilirubin is the end product of heme breakdown. It has no further benefit for the body and must be excreted; higher concentrations can even be toxic (see, for example, kernicterus). Bilirubin is fat-soluble, so for transport in the blood, it is bound to albumin and must be "made water-soluble" (conjugated) for further excretion.

- Indirect Bilirubin (unconjugated Bilirubin)
    - Strongly apolar and thus insoluble in water
    - Binds to albumin
    - Transport to the liver
- Direct bilirubin (conjugated bilirubin)
    - In hepatocytes, bilirubin is glucuronidated with UDP-glucuronic acid (conjugated/linked with sugar, corresponds to Phase II of biotransformation)
    - This makes bilirubin water-soluble.
    - Conjugated bilirubin is actively excreted into the bile ducts.
- Unconjugated bilirubin in the intestine
    - Is partially broken down by the gut bacteria
    - Contributes to the chair color
    - Is reabsorbed in small amounts and subsequently
        - Partially renal filtered, which gives urine its typical color.
        - Partially excreted again by the liver

> [!NOTE] Icterus
> If the bilirubin metabolism is disturbed, the pigment accumulates in the skin and jaundice occurs. The causes for this are diverse.
> 
> - Prehepatic: For example, in hemolysis in newborns with Rh or ABO incompatibility (hemolytic disease of the newborn)
> - Intrahepatic: e.g. in cases of liver diseases (hepatitis, liver cirrhosis)
> - Posthepatic: For example, in cases of bile duct obstruction (cholestasis) caused by gallstones.

## Hemoglobinopathies

### General

Hemoglobinopathies refer to a variety of genetically determined changes in hemoglobin. Worldwide, the prevalence is approximately 7% with significant regional differences. The epidemiologically most relevant forms are thalassemia and sickle cell disease.

Many hemoglobinopathies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. While homozygous mutations usually lead to severe defects or are lethal from the outset, heterozygous mutation carriers generally only experience mild symptoms. This often includes a hemolytic anemia, caused by defective hemoglobin.

### Thalassemia

Under the term thalassemia, various synthesis disorders of the globin chains are summarized, which lead to a reduced or even absent production of the same. The name is derived from the ancient Greek word for sea ("thalassa") – the disease occurs particularly around the Mediterranean. The high prevalence there is explained by the selective pressure from malaria – thalassemia increases resistance to the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Classification is based on the affected globin chain type: in principle, a thalassemia of any chain is conceivable and has also been described, but the greatest relevance is held by α- and β-thalassemia.

- Common clinical picture (expression depending on the number of affected genes)
    - Mainly microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemolysis
    - Iron overload due to recurrent transfusions
    - Target cells (syn. bull's-eye cells) in blood smear

#### α-Thalassemia

In α-thalassemia, the synthesis of α-globin chains is disturbed. Since there are two gene loci for the α-chain and they are located on two chromosomes, there are a total of four α-chain genes. The severity of the disease depends on how many of the four gene loci are affected by the mutation.

- Occurrence: Mainly Southeast Asia
- Pathophysiology: Mutation in α-chain gene
    - Four genes per person → Symptomatology depending on the number of affected genes
        - A gene: Slight symptomatology
        - Two genes: minor form, mild anemia
        - Three genes: Major form, strong increase of the pathological hemoglobins HbH (β4), Hb Barts (γ4) → Severe anemia, requirement for transfusions
        - Four genes: Affected individuals outside the womb are not viable.

#### β-Thalassemia

The β-thalassemia is the most common form in Europe. There is only one gene locus for the β-chain, so each person possesses two β-chain genes. Depending on whether one gene or both are affected, a distinction is made between thalassemia minor and thalassemia major.

- Occurrence: Mainly around the Mediterranean
- Pathophysiology: Mutation in the β-chain gene (Two genes → Thalassemia minor or major)
    - Thalassemia minor (one gene affected): Mild form, slight microcytic hypochromic anemia
    - Thalassemia major (both genes affected): Severe form with increased HbA2 (α2δ2) and HbF (α2γ2) → Pronounced anemia, requirement for transfusions

### Sickle Cell Disease

Sickle cell disease is another important hemoglobinopathy. It is based on a mutation in the β-chain gene, which does not lead to a lack of β-globin, but rather to pathologically altered β-chains. This results in altered unstable erythrocytes, which are referred to as sickle cells due to their typical shape. Not only does this lead to hemolytic anemia, but also a tendency for blockages in small vessels with corresponding circulation disorders. Like thalassemia, sickle cell disease offers some protection against infections with Plasmodium falciparum and thus against malaria diseases. This selective advantage explains the increased prevalence of sickle cell disease in Sub-Saharan Africa.

- Occurrence: Mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region
- Genetics: Point mutation in the β-chain gene → Replacement of glutamic acid with valine → Formation of pathological HbS instead of HbA1
    - In heterozygosity, a rather mild form of the disease; in homozygosity, a severe disease.
- Pathophysiology:
    - Through valine: Formation of a hydrophobic region in the globin chain → Hemoglobin can aggregate into fibrils
    - HbS fibrils impair the shape of erythrocytes
        - Hemolysis
        - Occlusion of small vessels → Circulatory disorders, infarcts
    - Fibril formation favored by low O2 partial pressure → Sickle cell crises under stress
## Review Questions on the Chapter Hemoglobin
### Hemoglobin Structure

Name examples of other heme-containing proteins besides hemoglobin!
- Heme are not only contained in hemoglobin but also function, among other things, as a prosthetic group in cytochromes (e.g., cytochrome P450 enzymes, cytochrome c) and in myoglobin.
### Hemoglobin Types and Variants

From which globin chains is fetal hemoglobin composed? What important advantage does it have over adult hemoglobin?
- Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the predominant hemoglobin type in the embryo, fetus, and newborn and consists of two α- and two γ-chains (α2γ2). HbF has a significantly higher oxygen affinity compared to adult HbA, which is also hardly influenced by 2,3-BPG. This facilitates the transfer of oxygen from maternal to fetal hemoglobin in the placenta.
Through which chemical reaction does glycohemoglobin HbA1c form, and what diagnostic significance does it have?
- Glycohemoglobin HbA1c is an irreversibly modified form of hemoglobin formed by the attachment of glucose to amino acid residues of adult hemoglobin. This so-called glycation is not catalyzed by an enzyme but occurs spontaneously depending on the glucose concentration. The HbA1c value is an important diagnostic long-term parameter in diabetes mellitus. Due to the erythrocyte lifespan of 120 days, the determination of the proportion of HbA1c in total hemoglobin allows an assessment of blood sugar levels over the past 4–12 weeks ("blood sugar memory"). If the average blood sugar concentration was elevated over the past weeks, a correspondingly increased HbA1c concentration is shown.
Through which reaction does hemoglobin turn into methemoglobin (Met-Hb)? What is the danger of increased formation?
- Methemoglobin (Met-Hb) refers to hemoglobin whose iron ion has been oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. This occurs constantly and spontaneously. A radical forms in this reaction, the superoxide anion O2–. Since Met-Hb can no longer bind oxygen, oxygen deficiency threatens at very high concentrations in the blood (e.g., in the case of a congenital deficiency of the enzyme methemoglobin reductase).
A small part of the CO2 present in the blood is transported bound to hemoglobin as carbaminohemoglobin. At which position of the hemoglobin does it bind?
- CO2 can covalently bind to the terminal NH2 group of the α-globin chains of hemoglobin and thus be transported in the blood. However, the much larger part of CO2 is transported in the blood in the form of bicarbonate.
### Hemoglobin Synthesis

What are the starting materials of heme synthesis?
- The starting materials of heme synthesis are succinyl-CoA (from the citric acid cycle) and glycine.
Which is the key enzyme of heme synthesis, what cofactor does it require, and what substance is released in its reaction?
- The key enzyme of heme synthesis is δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase. It catalyzes, using its cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PALP), the reaction of succinyl-CoA and glycine to α-amino-β-ketoadipic acid, which is then spontaneously decarboxylated to δ-aminolevulinic acid. Coenzyme A is released from succinyl-CoA during the reaction.
In heme synthesis, δ-aminolevulinic acid is produced in the mitochondria and then transported to the cytoplasm. What further reaction steps follow?
- In the cytoplasm, δ-aminolevulinic acid is first converted into porphobilinogen. Four molecules of porphobilinogen are assembled in several steps into the porphyrin ring system, into which iron is subsequently incorporated (again in the mitochondria), resulting in heme.
### Hemoglobin Degradation

Where does the breakdown of hemoglobin take place and what role does haptoglobin play in this process?
- Most erythrocytes are broken down by macrophages in the spleen, which immediately degrade hemoglobin as well. If erythrocytes are destroyed outside the spleen, the free hemoglobin is first bound to the transport protein haptoglobin and thus delivered to the monocyte phagocyte system (MPS). Haptoglobin is an α2-globulin that can form a stable complex with free hemoglobin.
Describe the first step of heme degradation catalyzed by heme oxygenase! Which substances are consumed, which are released?
- In the first step of heme degradation, biliverdin is formed. Heme oxygenase first opens the porphyrin ring system, releasing one carbon atom and the iron ion, which can then be reused. The carbon atom is oxidized with the consumption of O2 and NADPH + H+ and leaves the reaction as carbon monoxide (CO).
How is biliverdin converted into bilirubin?
- In the final step of heme degradation, biliverdin reductase reduces green biliverdin to orange bilirubin using NADPH + H+.
How do indirect (unconjugated) and direct (conjugated) bilirubin differ in their solubility behavior?
- Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble. Only through conjugation in the liver is bilirubin made water-soluble and subsequently excreted via the biliary tract.
What happens during the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver? Which enzyme is involved?
- Bilirubin is the end product of heme and has no further use for the body. However, in its original non-water-soluble form, it cannot be excreted. In hepatocytes, bilirubin is coupled to two molecules of UDP-glucuronic acid (glucuronidated) with the help of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, thereby becoming water-soluble and able to be excreted via the bile ducts.
### Hemoglobinopathies
Which hereditary disease is caused by a point mutation in the β-chain of hemoglobin?
- In sickle cell anemia, a point mutation in the gene of β-globin causes the substitution of the amino acid glutamate with valine. This produces a pathologically altered hemoglobin, called HbS, which especially at low oxygen partial pressure leads to an unstable (sickle-shaped) deformation of the erythrocytes.
