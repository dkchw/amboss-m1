# Water and Electrolyte Balance
## Summary

The human body is made up mostly of water and also contains a variety of specific electrolytes. Both the overall function of the human body and that of each individual cell depend significantly on the presence of these components in adequate and balanced proportions. To ensure this, the body's water and electrolyte balance is subject to a complex regulatory system.

Water and electrolytes occur in different compositions in various compartments (so-called fluid compartments) of the human body. The electrolytes (in the form of ions) act as osmotically active components in water. The main regulatory organ of water and electrolyte balance is the kidney. In the event of decompensation of the water balance, it can lead to dehydration or hyperhydration and life-threatening electrolyte imbalances.
## Distribution of Body Water

### Compartments

The body's fluid is distributed among two distinguishable compartments, the intracellular and extracellular space. The intracellular space includes the portion within a cell and represents the largest compartment. Extracellular fluids include transcellular, intravascular, and interstitial fluids. The respective distribution volume of these compartments can be calculated using specific indicator substances.

| **Compartment**         | **Extracellular space (ECS): Space outside the cells**                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Intracellular space (ICS): Space inside the cells**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### Calculation of Distribution Volumes

- Procedure: A known amount of indicator substance is injected intravenously. After about 2 hours, the concentration of the indicator substance in the plasma can be determined. From the distribution of the indicator substance in the fluid compartments, conclusions can be drawn about the distribution volume (V).
- Indicators: Substances that accumulate only in certain compartments and thereby make the content of this compartment indirectly measurable.
    - Evans Blue: Distribution corresponds to the intravascular distribution volume
    - Inulin: Distribution corresponds to the volume of distribution in the extracellular space.
    - Antipyrin, deuterium, tritium: Distributions correspond to the total water content of the body.
    - Derived size: The intracellular distribution volume can be calculated from the difference in the distribution volumes of antipyrine, deuterium or tritium, and inulin.
- Calculation: Distribution volume (V) = Amount applied / Plasma concentration
## Water Balance

Water is an essential component of our lives. It is needed for numerous reactions and mechanisms in our body and is used, among other things, as a solvent and coolant, heat buffer, and transport medium.

### Water Balance

A balanced water balance is ensured by daily water intake and water excretion, allowing for a constant water content in the body.

- Intake (2.5 L/day)
    - About drinks: 1.4 L
    - About food: 900 mL
    - Oxidation water: 300 mL
- Excretion (2.5 L/day)
    - About the urine: 1.5 L
    - About breathing and the skin: Approximately 10 mL/kg body weight per day
    - About the chair: 200 mL

### Regulation of the Water Management

The body's water needs are perceived through specialized receptors, namely baroreceptors, volume receptors, and osmoreceptors, and are regulated by the sensation of thirst and the excretion of water by the kidneys. A fundamental role is played by a number of hormones that are released in response to the perception of the receptors and, among other things, influence water excretion and reabsorption in the kidneys.

#### Osmoreceptors

Osmoreceptors in the portal vein system and hypothalamus detect the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid.

- Water deficiency → Plasma hyperosmolarity → ADH secretion and increased thirst sensation↑
- Water surplus → Plasma hypoosmolarity → ADH secretion and thirst sensation↓

#### Regulation of Thirst Sensation

Thirst sensation occurs after a water loss of about 0.5% of body weight. Depending on whether the fluid content decreases intracellularly or there is a volume deficit in the extracellular space, a distinction is made between osmotic and hypovolemic thirst.

- Osmotic thirst: Intracellular osmolality increases → Thirst center in the hypothalamus is activated via osmoreceptors → Thirst sensation and ADH secretion increase → Increased drinking and increased water retention in the kidneys → Osmolality decreases
- Hypovolemic thirst: Blood pressure and blood volume decrease → Baroreceptors and volume receptors are activated less → Increased ADH secretion and activation of the RAAS → Increased drinking and rising water retention in the kidney → Blood pressure and blood volume increase

##### Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP)

- Function: Lowering of blood pressure and blood volume
- Synthesis: In the myocytes of the atria, especially of the right atrium
- Stimulation through
    - Volume increase (elevated central venous pressure): It is recorded by stretch sensors in the atria.
- Effect: ANP lowers arterial blood pressure and increases natriuresis and diuresis through the following mechanisms:
    - Relaxation of the smooth vascular muscle, thereby
        - Drop in blood pressure
        - Increase in renal medullary blood flow and glomerular filtration rate → Enhanced natriuresis and diuresis
    - Inhibition of the epithelial Na+-channel in the collecting duct → Decrease in renal Na+-reabsorption → Increase in Na+-excretion and consequently also in water excretion → Decrease in central venous pressure (CVP)
    - Inhibition of aldosterone, renin, ADH, and ACTH release

### Disruptions of the Water Balance

> [!NOTE] Dehydration
> Dehydration is a clinical condition that often needs to be treated, especially in elderly people. Typical clinical signs include reduced body weight, low blood pressure, decreased urine output, and elevated hematocrit in laboratory tests. Therapeutically, isotonic dehydration is balanced by administering a balanced electrolyte solution! In hypertonic dehydration (e.g., due to excessive sweating), more water than electrolytes is excreted, resulting in elevated serum sodium (hypertonic) and water moving from the intracellular to the extracellular space due to the osmotic gradient. Due to the increased water loss, both extracellular and intracellular volumes are reduced. However, the amount of hemoglobin present does not change, resulting in an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).

> [!NOTE] Water for injection purposes
> When it comes to water for injection purposes (Aqua ad iniectabilia), it is hypotonic, sterile water that may only be used for the preparation, dissolution, and dilution of medicines! It must not be injected without dissolved medications, as its hypotonic properties can otherwise lead to cell and tissue swelling.

> [!NOTE] Parenteral Nutrition
> Electrolyte solutions are clinically used to balance the body's mineral levels. Glucose solutions, on the other hand, are clinically used for parenteral energy supply in the context of artificial nutrition and do not contain electrolytes! However, glucose easily crosses cell membranes and is osmotically active there, which can quickly increase the intracellular volume. It should therefore be considered in therapeutic use that the hypotonic nature of the glucose solution may pose a risk of pulmonary edema, for example!

> [!NOTE] Osmotic myelinolysis
> If hyponatremia is corrected too quickly through sodium substitution, the increased intravascular osmolarity can lead to the outflow of water from the myelin sheaths, resulting in the destruction of the myelin sheaths (so-called "osmotic myelinolysis"). Usually, the central region of the pons is affected (hence also referred to as "central pontine myelinolysis"). To counteract this, sodium must be substituted slowly and under constant monitoring of serum sodium levels.

## Sodium

Sodium (Na+) is significantly involved in the regulation of water exchange between the intracellular and extracellular space. Furthermore, the sodium gradient between the intracellular and extracellular space is a prerequisite for the generation of action potentials and serves as a driving force for secondary active processes. Humans primarily absorb sodium through food.

For shifts in sodium balance, see: Electrolyte disorders sodium.

### Distribution in the Body

- Total content: 70–100 g (55–60 mmol/kg body weight)
    - Extracellular (Serum concentration): Approx. 135–145 mmol/L (95 %)
        - Hyponatremia = Serum concentration <135 mmol/L
        - Hypernatremia = Serum concentration >145 mmol/L
    - Intracellular: Approx. 10–15 mmol/L (5 %)
- Maintenance of sodium distribution: Via the Na+-K+-ATPase

### Intake and Excretion

Sodium is found as a component of table salt in almost all foods. Cheese, meat, seafood, and bread have a particularly high sodium content.

- Average salt intake: Approximately 5–15 g/day
- Average Na+ excretion: Approx. 3 g/day
    - 95% are excreted through the kidneys.
    - 5% will be excreted through sweat and stool.

### Regulation

The regulation of sodium concentration is carried out by the RAAS and ANP.

### Function

- Regulation of the water exchange between IZR and EZR
- Sodium gradient
    - Requirement for the generation of action potentials
    - Driving force for secondarily active processes

> [!NOTE] Arterial Hypertension
> A high daily intake of salt increases the risk of essential (primary) hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. The underlying pathomechanism is not yet fully understood. It is being discussed whether a genetic component plays a role, as a familial clustering has been observed in salt-sensitive hypertension. Other risk factors for primary arterial hypertension include smoking, advanced age, obesity, and high alcohol consumption.

> [!NOTE] Nutrient regulations
> Pathological serum sodium concentrations are usually based on a change in water balance and are thus a result of concentration or dilution. Less frequently, actual sodium losses (diuretics, diarrhea, vomiting) or sodium loads (increased intake) are the cause. Hypo- and hypernatremias can lead to various neurological symptoms. Most commonly, muscle reflexes increase and there is a risk of epileptic seizures due to a lowered seizure threshold.

## Potassium

Potassium (K+) is the osmotically most important cation of the intracellular space. It plays a crucial role in the generation of action potentials and is also involved in the regulation of pH levels.

For shifts in potassium balance see: Electrolyte disorders potassium.

### Distribution in the Body

- Total content: 140 g (40–50 mmol/kg body weight)
    - Extracellular (Serum concentration): Approx. 3.6–5.2 mmol/L (2%)
        - Hypokalemia = Serum concentration < 3.6 mmol/L
        - Hyperkalemia = Serum concentration > 5.2 mmol/L
    - Intracellular: Approximately 140–160 mmol/L (98%)
- Maintenance of potassium distribution: Via the Na+-K+-ATPase

### Intake and Excretion

Potassium is absorbed through food and is mainly found in oranges, bananas, apricots, figs, meat, and potatoes.

- Average intake: 2–6 g/day (50–150 mmol)
- Average excretion: Approximately 25 mmol/day are excreted through sweat, stool, and urine.
    - Approximately 10% are excreted enterally.
    - About 90% are excreted renally.

### Regulation

The potassium concentration is regulated by the RAAS. In this process, aldosterone indirectly influences potassium distribution through Na+ resorption.

### Function

- Influence on the resting membrane potential
- Influence of the pH value

> [!NOTE] Heart rhythm disorders
> A low concentration of potassium in the serum (= hypokalemia) and a high concentration of potassium in the serum (= hyperkalemia) increase the risk of life-threatening heart rhythm disorders. Hypokalemia can occur, for example, in the case of severe diarrhea, intense vomiting, or uncontrolled, intense insulin therapy (temporary potassium shift into cells). Hyperkalemia is triggered, for example, by chronic kidney failure, increased potassium release from body cells (trauma, hemolysis), or insulin deficiency. Depending on the severity, symptoms can range from mild heart palpitations or rapid heartbeat to heart attack with cardiogenic shock.

## Calcium

Calcium (Ca2+) is the most abundant mineral in the human body, with a total content of about 1 kg. However, it exists 99% bound as calcium phosphate in the bones.

For shifts in calcium balance see: Electrolyte disturbances calcium.

### Distribution in the Body

- Total weight: Approx. 1 kg
    - Extracellular (Serum concentration): Total calcium approx. 2.20–2.65 mmol/L
        - Hypokalemia = Serum concentration total calcium <2.20 mmol/L or ionized calcium <1.15 mmol/L
        - Hypercalcemia = Serum concentration total calcium >2.65 mmol/L or ionized calcium >1.35 mmol/L
        - Approximately 1.15–1.35 mmol/L of this is ionized, unbound, and consequently biologically active calcium.
        - The remaining calcium is bound and therefore biologically inactive calcium
    - Intracellular: Ionized Calcium: Ca. 0.0001 mmol/L

### Intake and Excretion

Calcium is absorbed through food and is primarily found in milk and dairy products, cheese, and green vegetables. The Ca2+ ions enter the cytosol of the enterocytes through an ion channel.

- Average intake: 0.8–1.2 g/day
- Average Excretion
    - ⅔ of the orally ingested calcium is not absorbed, but is excreted with the stool.
    - 1% of the glomerularly freely filtered calcium is excreted with the urine.

### Regulation

The regulation of calcium balance is subject to a complex mechanism and is regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, and calcitonin. For more details, see parathyroid glands.

### Function

- Component of signal transduction cascades
    - As an intracellular second messenger
    - Increase in presynaptic transmitter release at chemical synapses
- Component of muscle contraction through binding to accessory proteins
- Stabilization of the membrane potential
- Function as a coagulation factor (Factor IV)
- Formation of tooth and bone substance as calcium phosphate (= Ca3(PO4)2)

> [!NOTE] Acidosis/Alkalosis
> Calcium competes with protons for protein binding sites. In acidosis with a decrease in pH (protons↑) of the blood, there is more free calcium. Clinically, hypercalcemia can be very variable (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, constipation, paresis) to asymptomatic. In alkalosis (e.g., in respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation during a panic attack) with an increase in pH (protons↓) of the blood, there is less free calcium. Clinically, it can lead to paresthesias, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias. This condition is also referred to as hyperventilation tetany.

## Phosphate

Phosphate (PO4−) is the second most abundant mineral in the human body, with a body content of about 700 g (after calcium). It is found bound as calcium phosphate in the bone, making up 85% together with calcium.

### Distribution in the Body

- Total weight: Approx. 700 g
    - Extracellular (Serum concentration): Approx. 0.84–1.45 mmol/L (1%)
        - Hypophosphatemia = Serum concentration <0.84 mmol/L
        - Hyperphosphatemia = Serum concentration >1.45 mmol/L
    - Intracellular: 14%

### Intake and Excretion

Phosphate is obtained through food and is mainly found in fish, meat, nuts, seeds, cheese, and chocolate.

- Average intake: 0.7–1.3 g/day
- Average Excretion
    - ⅔ of the orally ingested phosphates are not absorbed, but are excreted with the stool.
    - Depending on serum concentration, 5–20% of the glomerularly freely filtered phosphate is excreted.

### Regulation

The regulation of phosphate balance is governed by a complex mechanism and is controlled by parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, and calcitonin. For more details on this, see parathyroid glands.

### Function

- Regulation of energy metabolism (e.g. in glycolysis in the form of adenosine triphosphate = ATP)
- Formation of tooth and bone substance as calcium phosphate (Ca3(PO4)2)
- Regulation of the acid-base balance (phosphate buffer system)
- Regulation of enzyme activities through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation

> [!NOTE] Hyperphosphatemia
> With a permanently elevated phosphate concentration in the serum of >2 mmol/L, the body can no longer excrete the excess phosphate through the intestines and kidneys. Clinically, this leads to hyperfunction of the parathyroid glands due to increased PTH stimulation, increased bone remodeling and resorption, and the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the soft tissues. This results in a decrease in the Ca2+ serum level!

## Magnesium

Magnesium (Mg2+) is the least represented mineral in the human organism, with a body content of about 20 g, and is present 65% bound in the bones.

### Distribution in the Body

- Total content: Approximately 20 g (approximately 16 mmol/kg body weight)
    - Extracellular (Serum concentration): Approx. 0.73–1.06 mmol/L (1%)
    - Intracellular: Approximately 15 mmol/L (34%)

### Intake and Excretion

Magnesium is absorbed through food and is mainly found in seeds, nuts, cocoa, fruits, and vegetables.

- Average intake: 0.3–0.35 g/day
- Average Excretion
    - ⅔ of the orally ingested magnesium is not absorbed and is excreted with the stool.
    - 30% of the filtered magnesium is excreted

### Regulation

The magnesium balance is closely linked to the absorption capacity of the intestines and kidneys.

- Enteral Resorption
    - Increased by calcitriol, parathyroid hormone, and somatotropin
    - Is inhibited by calcitonin and aldosterone
- Renal Resorption
    - Increased by calcitriol
    - Is inhibited by calcitonin

### Function

- Regulation of signal transduction as a cofactor of enzymes
- Reduction of neuromuscular excitability through
    - Inhibition of acetylcholine release at the motor end plate
    - Inhibition of Ca2+ channels at nerve endings and the sarcoplasmic reticulum
- Build-up of tooth and bone substance

> [!NOTE] Muscle cramps ("tetany")
> Magnesium is a physiological calcium antagonist that prevents the intracellular accumulation of calcium. In the case of hypomagnesemia, a redistribution of calcium into the cells can lead to hypocalcemia. Both the hypocalcemia and the underlying hypomagnesemia itself result in increased excitability of muscle cells, presenting clinically as muscle cramps.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Water and Electrolyte Balance
### Water Balance

What stimulates the release of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and how does it exert its effect?
- The release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is stimulated by stretching of the atria due to volume increase. The stretch receptors located there register the increased central venous pressure, after which ANP is released from the myocytes of the atria. It causes a reduction in arterial blood pressure as well as increased natriuresis and diuresis through: 1. relaxation of the smooth vascular muscle (which simultaneously increases renal medullary perfusion and thus the glomerular filtration rate), 2. inhibition of aldosterone, renin, ADH, and ACTH release, and 3. inhibition of the epithelial Na+ channel in the collecting duct, thereby decreasing renal Na+ reabsorption.

What forms of dehydration are there, how are they characterized, and how can they occur?
- In hypertonic dehydration, water loss is greater than sodium loss, which can occur, for example, in fever or heavy sweating. Hypotonic dehydration, in contrast, is characterized by predominant sodium loss, for example in diarrhea or vomiting. In isotonic dehydration, loss of sodium and water occurs in the same proportion, such as in bleeding.

What is hypotonic hyperhydration and how does it occur?
- Hypotonic hyperhydration refers to a surplus of water due to a greater intake of water than sodium. This can be caused, for example, by excessive drinking of distilled water.

### Sodium

The normal extracellular serum concentration of sodium is typically around 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), and this concentration is essential for various functions such as maintaining fluid balance, transmitting nerve impulses, and regulating muscle contractions.
- The physiological normal values of serum sodium concentration lie between 135–145 mmol/L – above this is referred to as hypernatremia, below this range as hyponatremia. The sodium gradient is a prerequisite for the generation of action potentials and the driving force for secondary active transport processes. Furthermore, sodium largely determines the osmolarity of the extracellular space (ECS) (regulation of water exchange between intracellular space (ICS) and ECS).

### Potassium

What can cause hyperkalemia?
- Hyperkalemia can be caused, for example, by chronic kidney failure, increased potassium release from body cells (trauma, hemolysis), or insulin deficiency.

### Calcium

How does calcium enter the enterocyte from the intestinal lumen?
- Calcium is absorbed from food by Ca2+ ions entering the cytosol of enterocytes through an ion channel.

What influence does breathing have on the serum concentration of calcium? What symptoms would one expect as a result of severe hyperventilation?
- In respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation (but also in other alkaloses), the blood pH value increases. Due to the reduced number of protons, more free calcium binds to albumin, which lowers the serum concentration of biologically active, free Ca2+ ions. Clinically, this can lead to dizziness, tingling paraesthesia, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias (hyperventilation tetany).

### Magnesium

What is the concentration of Mg2+ ions extracellularly and intracellularly, and what percentage do they each contribute to the total content?
- The extracellular magnesium concentration is about 0.73–1.06 mmol/L, which corresponds to about 1% of the total magnesium content in the body. The intracellular concentration of Mg2+ is about 15 mmol/L, a multiple of this, and accounts for about 34% of the total magnesium content. 65% of magnesium is bound in the bone.
