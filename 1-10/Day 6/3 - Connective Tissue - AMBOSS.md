# Connective Tissue
## Summary

The term "connective tissue" can be interpreted in two ways: On one hand, connective tissue "connects" different types of tissues in the body and serves as a reserve or displacement layer, e.g., between the mucous membrane and the smooth muscle in the intestine. On the other hand, the special intercellular space of connective tissue, also referred to as the "extracellular matrix," acts as a kind of "binding agent" for large amounts of ions and water, which are crucial to the biomechanical properties of connective tissue.
## Development and Composition

### Development of Connective Tissue

Regardless of the localization, all connective and supportive tissues in the body originate from the mesenchyme. The mesenchyme itself mostly comes from the mesoderm.

- Output: Predominantly mesoderm
- Further development steps
    1. Mesoderm differentiates into mesenchyme.
        - Mesenchyme
            - Definition: Embryonic connective tissue
            - Structure
                - Cells: Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells
                - Intercellular: Abundant water-binding hyaluronate (= gelatinous matrix)
    2. Mesenchyme forms all the cells of connective tissue.
    3. Connective tissue cells synthesize the intercellular substance (= extracellular matrix)

### Composition of Connective Tissue

Connective tissue consists of specialized cells and the intervening intercellular space. The intercellular space occupies a particularly large volume in connective tissue and contains fibrous proteins as well as a special "ground substance" capable of binding a lot of water.

#### Cells

1. Resident cells
2. Mobile Cells

#### Extracellular Matrix

1. Fibers
    - Built from collagen molecules
        - Collagen fibers
        - Reticular fibers
    - Elastic fibers (made up of elastin molecules)
2. "Basic substance"
    - Glycosaminoglycans
    - Proteoglycans
    - Glycoproteins
3. Water

## Cells of Connective Tissue

The main cell type in connective tissue is the fibroblast, which is responsible for the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Additionally, various immune system cells are present in connective tissue.

- Resident cells
    - Fibroblast
        - Definition: Most common cell type of connective tissue, whose main function is the synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.
        - Histological characteristics: Spindle-shaped cell with branched processes that create a three-dimensional network between fibroblasts.
    - Fibrocyte: Correspond to fibroblasts with low synthetic activity.
    - Myofibroblast
        - Definition: Contractile "hybrid cell" with properties of fibroblasts and leiomyocytes, which synthesizes components of the extracellular matrix.
        - Histological characteristics: Not distinguishable from fibroblasts under light microscopy
        - Occurrences
            - Physiological: Myometrium (Uterus), Tunica albuginea (Testes), Alveolar framework (Lung), Pericytes (Blood vessels), Spleen capsule
            - In injured tissues (wound healing)
- Mobile cells: In the connective tissue, immune system cells such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells constantly patrol.

## Extracellular Matrix

Under the term "extracellular matrix" (ECM), one must envision a three-dimensional network of various macromolecules. Depending on the exact composition of the extracellular matrix, the connective tissue has different biomechanical properties. The macromolecules can be divided into the following main groups:

- Connective tissue fibers
    - Collagen fibers
    - Reticular fibers
    - Elastic fibers
- Glycosaminoglycans
- Proteoglycans
- Glycoproteins

## Connective Tissue Fibers

The three fiber types of the ECM (collagenous, reticular, and elastic fibers) each consist of several thousand protein molecules linked together in a chain. There are two types of proteins distinguished: collagen and elastin. Collagen molecules form the collagenous fibers and the reticular fibers, while elastin molecules form the elastic fibers.

#### Collagen

- Definition: Collagens are glycoproteins that are secreted by fibroblasts and assemble extracellularly into long-chain, partially fiber-forming macromolecules (=polymers). Depending on the amino acid sequence, about 20 isoforms are distinguished.
- Properties of collagen molecules
    - Insoluble
    - There are fibril-forming (fibrillary) and non-fibril-forming (=non-fibrillary) types of collagen.
- Structure: Collagen molecule = protein with repetitive amino acid sequence (Gly-X-Y)n
    - The first amino acid in this triplet is always glycine.
    - Position X: Mostly Proline (Second most common: Lysine or Hydroxylysine)
    - Position Y: Mostly Hydroxyproline (Second most common: Lysine or Hydroxylysine)
- Breakdown: Occurs enzymatically through specific collagenases
- Biosynthesis: The formation of collagen corresponds to the biosynthesis of secretory proteins with several post-translational modifications, which are presented in the following table.

> [!NOTE]
> Vitamin C is required for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine, thus it is a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. This hydroxylation is a prerequisite for a later cross-linking of collagen. The actual cross-linking by lysyl oxidase (!) is not vitamin C-dependent!

> [!NOTE] Osteogenesis imperfecta (also known as brittle bone disease)
> Osteogenesis imperfecta refers to a group of genetically inherited bone disorders characterized by significantly reduced bone stability due to a disturbance in collagen synthesis. Currently, eleven different forms are described, which differ in the gene locus of the mutation as well as the severity of the disease. About 90% of all cases of Osteogenesis imperfecta are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the gene for collagen type I protein. For example, in Osteogenesis imperfecta type IV, a mutation leads to the substitution of a glycine with various larger amino acids. This results in a disruption of the "twisting" of the three pro-α chains into a triple helix. Consequently, defective collagen is formed, which cannot fulfill its stabilizing function within the extracellular matrix of the bone. Those affected are prone to fractures even with minimal bone stress, sometimes even in utero or during birth. Thus, individuals may suffer more than a hundred bone fractures over their lifetime, resulting in later bone deformities and dwarfism.

#### Elastin

Elastin is, alongside collagen, the second fiber-forming protein of the extracellular matrix. Several elastin molecules are interconnected (= polymerization) and bundled into elastic fibers that, among other things, give elasticity to blood vessels or skin.

- Definition: Elastin is a protein with a high content of the amino acids glycine and proline.
- Properties: Elasticity of the connective tissue (due to alternating α-helices and hydrophobic domains)
- Biosynthesis
    - Intracellular: Synthesis of the precursor peptide Tropoelastin → Exocytosis
    - Extracellular: Tropoelastin binds to microfibrils (consisting of the protein fibrillin) → Covalent cross-linking of tropoelastins with each other through lysyl oxidase → Elastic fiber
- Breakdown: Occurs enzymatically through elastase (inhibition of elastase by α1-antitrypsin)

> [!NOTE] Marfan syndrome
> In the genetically inherited Marfan syndrome, a mutation in the Fibrillin-1 gene leads to the faulty formation of elastic fibers. The resulting connective tissue weakness manifests externally as tall stature, abnormally flexible joints with a tendency for dislocations, and arachnodactyly. Internally, it can result in aneurysmal dilation of the aorta with potentially life-threatening dissection.

### Glycosaminoglycans

- Definition: Glycosaminoglycans are long carbohydrate chains made up of repeating disaccharide units without protein content, possessing a strong negative charge, and constitute the largest volume fraction of the extracellular matrix.
- Structure of a GAG molecule: Polymer made of repeating disaccharide units
- Building principle: 1. Sugar = Hexuronic acid, 2. Sugar = Hexosamine
    - Example: Hyaluronan consists of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine
- Function
    - Binding of H2O in the connective tissue → cushioning function
    - Component of proteoglycans
- Four main groups: Hyaluronate, Chondroitin sulfate, Heparin/Heparan sulfate, Keratan sulfate

|Main Group|   |Disaccharide Units|Glycosidic Bond|Occurrence|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Hyaluronate|   |GlcA + GlcNAc|β|- Skin<br>- Synovial fluid (in the joint)<br>- Umbilical cord<br>- Vitreous body (eye)|- Up to 25,000 disaccharides long<br>- Function in embryogenesis<br>- The only GAG without a sulfate group!|
|Chondroitin sulfate|Chondroitin-4-sulfate|GlcA + GalNAc|β|- Cartilage<br>- Aorta|- Sulfate group at C4|
|Chondroitin-6-sulfate|GlcA + GalNAc|β|- Heart valves|- Sulfate group at C6|
|Dermatan sulfate|GlcA / IduA + GalNAc|β|- Heart valves<br>- Blood vessels<br>- Skin|- Sulfate group at C4|
|Heparin|   |GlcA / IduA + GlcN|α and β|- Intracellular: Mast cells (from lung, liver, skin)|- Anticoagulant<br>- Often multiple sulfate groups on GlcN|
|Heparan sulfate|   |GlcA / IduA + GlcN / GlcNAc|- Endothelial/Epithelial<br>- Basement membrane|- Antithrombin-binding|
|Keratan sulfate|   |Gal + GlcNAc|β|- Cornea<br>- Cartilage and bone<br>- Nucleus pulposus|- No uronic acid<br>- Sulfate groups on both monosaccharides|
|Abbr.: GlcA = Glucuronic acid, GlcNAc = N-Acetylglucosamine, GalNAc = N-Acetylgalactosamine, IduA = Iduronic acid, GlcN = Glucosamine, Gal = Galactose|   |   |   |   |   |

> [!NOTE]
> Allen glycosaminoglycans share their strong negative charge due to their sulfate and carboxyl groups. Together with Na+ cations, large amounts of water can be bound in the matrix.

> [!NOTE] Non-oral anticoagulation with heparin
> The glycosaminoglycan heparin is clinically used as a subcutaneous injection solution for thrombosis prophylaxis. It works by binding to antithrombin in the blood. To bind, the heparin molecules must be at least 18 monosaccharides long. A specific pentasaccharide sequence in heparin is responsible for this binding, which features a glucosamine at its center with an essential negatively charged C3-sulfate group. The conformational change of antithrombin resulting from the heparin binding accelerates the breakdown of its substrates thrombin and factor Xa by about a factor of 1000.

### Proteoglycans

- Definition: Protein with many covalently linked glycosaminoglycan side chains. Due to the variety of glycosaminoglycans and the variable chain length, an almost infinite number of proteoglycan molecules arises.
- Functions
    - Mechanical
        - H2O binding → Damping and support function (e.g. in cartilage tissue → cf. compressibility of articular cartilage)
        - Cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts
    - Cell communication: Signaling molecules/growth factors secreted by other cells can be bound by proteoglycans.
    - Regulatory
        - Can extracellular enzymes inactivate
        - Chemotaxis: Binding of pro-inflammatory chemokines from the blood to proteoglycans → Concentration of chemokines at the site of inflammation → Migration of leukocytes from the bloodstream into the extracellular matrix
- Special Representatives
    - Aggrecan: Proteoglycan, primarily found in cartilage as an aggregate with hyaluronate → cushioning function (cf. → bone and cartilage)
    - Decorin: Binds collagen → Fibrillogenesis of collagen
    - Perlecan: Only found in the basement membrane → Filter function

> [!NOTE]
> Proteoglycans mainly consist of carbohydrates that are attached laterally to a small protein core! Glycoproteins, on the other hand, mainly consist of a protein to which short carbohydrate chains are attached laterally!

### Glycoproteins

Several glycoproteins are involved in the composition of the extracellular matrix. These are proteins with attached short carbohydrate chains. Below is an overview of the most important non-fibril-forming glycoproteins present here.

#### Fibronectin

- Definition: Fibronectin is a dimeric protein that occurs in various isoforms due to alternative splicing.
- Function
    - Connector protein
        - Binds to collagen: connection between individual ECM components
        - Binds to integrins: Connection between ECM and cell
    - Embryonic development: Manages the migration of cells
    - Hemostasis: Fibronectin additionally links fibrin molecules (the main component of the blood clot) with the membranes of platelets and fibroblasts during blood coagulation.

#### Laminin

- Definition: Laminin is a heterotrimeric protein that occurs in various isoforms through alternative splicing.
- Function
    - Component of the basal lamina
    - Connector protein
        - Binds to integrins → Connection between the basement membrane and the cell
        - Binds to collagen type IV and perlecan → connection between the basement membrane and other ECM components

## The different forms of connective tissue

### Loose collagenous connective tissue (Interstitial connective tissue)

- Main components: collagen fibers (especially types I and III), elastic fibers, hyaluronate, decorin
- Function
    - Building substance for the orange frameworks (=interstitium)
    - Shear layer
- Occurrence
    - Intercellular space (=Stroma) of all epithelial organs
    - Wall of hollow organs
    - Papillary layer of the dermis
    - As a "cuff" around vascular nerve bundles
- Special feature
    - Most common type of connective tissue in the body

    - Reticular fibers, fibronectin
    - Fibroblastic reticulum cells
        - Histological characteristics: Large cell with branched extensions that envelop the reticular fibers.
- Function: Reticulum cells and reticular fibers form a network in whose meshes the stem cells of blood and the immune system mature.
- Occurrence: In the bone marrow and the secondary lymphatic organs

### Elastic Bands

- Main components: Elastic fibers > Collagen fibers
- Function: Gives bands higher elasticity
- Occurrences: Lig. flava, Lig. nuchae
- Special feature: Macroscopically, these bands exhibit a slightly yellow hue.

### Gelatinous Connective Tissue

- Main components: Fine collagen fibers, hyaluronate, and H2O constitute the so-called "Wharton jelly."
- Function: Protection of the umbilical cord vessels from constriction (due to the high flexibility of the gelatinous connective tissue with low compressibility)
- Occurrence
    - Umbilical cord
    - Skin in embryonic development
    - Pulp of young teeth
- Special feature: Relatively low in cells

### Spinozellular Connective Tissue

- Main components: Few reticular fibers and many cells
- Function: Follicle formation in the ovary (= folliculogenesis)
- Occurrence: Only in the ovary (Cortex ovarii = ovarian cortex)
- Special feature: Microscopic strictly parallel ("fishing rod-like") alignment of the spindle-shaped fibroblasts

### Special Variations of Connective Tissue

Some types of tissues in the body consist almost entirely of connective tissue with a specially composed extracellular matrix. They are discussed in separate chapters due to their special functions. These include:

- Bands → General Anatomy
- Tendons → General Anatomy
- Cartilage tissue
- Bone tissue

## Review Questions on the Chapter Connective Tissue
### Development and Composition

Describe the composition of connective tissue.
- Connective tissue consists of specialized cells and the intervening intercellular space, the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is formed by a three-dimensional network of connective tissue fibers and a "ground substance" composed of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. The ground substance is capable of binding large amounts of water, which serves the pressure elasticity of the connective tissue.

What types of connective tissue fibers are there in the extracellular matrix and what protein is each of them made from?
- Three types of connective tissue fibers of the extracellular matrix are distinguished: collagenous, reticular, and elastic fibers. Collagenous and reticular fibers are made from collagen molecules, whereas elastic fibers are made from elastin molecules.

Describe the basic structure of collagens. How do the collagen isoforms differ from each other?
- Collagens are glycoproteins secreted by fibroblasts, whose protein portion consists of repetitive amino acid sequences. The first amino acid of this triplet is always glycine, the second is usually proline (second most common: lysine or hydroxylysine), and the third position is generally hydroxyproline (second most common: lysine or hydroxylysine). Approximately 20 collagen isoforms are distinguished according to the amino acid sequence, which differ in their properties (e.g., their ability to assemble into fibers).

What steps are involved in collagen biosynthesis?
- Collagen formation corresponds to the biosynthesis of secretory proteins with several post-translational modifications. After translation of the pre-procollagen, intracellular hydroxylation and glycosylation of the polypeptide chain occur in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), producing procollagen. Subsequently, three procollagen molecules coil around each other to form the triple helix. After exocytosis, the triple helix is processed extracellularly. Through cross-linking, collagen fibrils form, which may then assemble into collagen fibers.

What is the function of the so-called signal peptide of the precursor protein of collagen?
- At the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain of the collagen precursor protein is a short amino acid sequence called the signal peptide. It mediates the transport of the emerging collagen molecule into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER).

Describe the process and function of hydroxylation and name the involved enzymes and cofactors.
- The hydroxylation of the pre-procollagen formed during translation occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Proline and lysine residues of the polypeptide chain are equipped with OH groups (hydroxyl groups) to enable subsequent cross-linking through hydrogen bonds and covalent atomic bonds. Hydroxylation is mediated by vitamin C-dependent hydroxylases (prolyl hydroxylase, lysyl hydroxylase); other cofactors are α-ketoglutarate, Fe2+, and O2.

Where does the so-called processing of procollagen take place and what purpose does it serve?
- Procollagen is secreted into the extracellular space in the form of a triple helix, where the first extracellular synthesis step, called processing, takes place. The propeptides at the C- and N-termini of procollagen are cleaved off, producing water-insoluble tropocollagen. The propeptides prevent premature fibril formation intracellularly, and their cleavage allows for proper formation of collagen fibrils extracellularly.

How do collagen fibrils and fibers form?
- After cleavage of the propeptides, several tropocollagens assemble extracellularly into fibrils. Cross-linking within the fibrils is mediated by the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which converts hydroxylysine residues of tropocollagen into allysine. The allysine residues of two tropocollagens can then spontaneously cross-link, creating a stable cross-linking of the fibrils. Several fibrils finally assemble into a thicker bundle, the collagen fiber, with the help of intercalated matrix-specific proteins.

To which class of substances do both heparin and hyaluronan belong? What is the structure of hyaluronan?
- Heparin and hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) belong to the glycosaminoglycans. Hyaluronan consists of repeating disaccharide units of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine.

How are glycosaminoglycans structured and what function do they have?
- Glycosaminoglycans are an important component of the extracellular matrix and are composed of long carbohydrate chains of repeating disaccharide units. Due to their numerous sulfate and carboxyl groups, they are strongly negatively charged and can bind large amounts of water. They thereby serve as cushioning.

How are proteoglycans structured? Which proteoglycan is present in hyaline cartilage and what function does it have there?
- The basic structure of proteoglycans is formed by glycosaminoglycans (= repetitive disaccharide units) bound laterally to a small protein portion. In hyaline cartilage, the proteoglycan aggrecan is present as an aggregate with hyaluronic acid and gives it a shock-absorbing effect.

### The different types of connective tissue

Describe the structure and function of dense collagenous connective tissue. Where is it typically found?
- Dense collagenous connective tissue provides tensile strength in mechanically highly stressed tissue (e.g., tendons, ligaments, aponeuroses). It consists largely of collagen fibers (especially type I), which may be arranged parallel or in a meshwork.
