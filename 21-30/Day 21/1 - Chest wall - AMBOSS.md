# Chest wall
## Summary

The chest wall includes the skin, superficial blood vessels, fascia, muscles, and the bony thorax, which consists of the ribs, the sternum, and the thoracic spine. It is primarily supplied by the so-called intercostal vessels, which are conduits that run in the intercostal space. The thorax supports the mechanics of breathing through the rib joints and the intercostal muscles. The organs located in the thoracic cavity project onto specific areas of the chest wall. By tapping the chest wall, the position of the thoracic organs can be determined, allowing inferences to be made about pathological changes. In order to document the position accurately, there are imagined auxiliary lines that project vertically onto the thorax.
## Topography

The course of the ribs and the intercostal spaces allows the thoracic wall to be divided into transverse (= oblique) zones. In addition, there are some vertically running auxiliary lines that facilitate the organization of the thoracic wall.

### Ripping

- Number of ribs: 12
- Length of the ribs: The length increases continuously up to the 7th rib and then decreases again.
- Sections of the ribs
    - Head of rib (= Caput costae): Has articular surfaces at the free end for the thoracic vertebrae.
    - Rib neck (= Collum costae): At the transition to the rib body, there is a thickening (= Tuberculum costae), where the transverse process of the thoracic vertebrae attaches from the 1st to the 10th rib.
    - Rib body (= Corpus costae): Longest section of the rib
        - Angulus costae (= rib angle): Location of the strongest curvature
        - Sulcus costae: Groove located on the inside and bottom where the intercostal nerves and vessels run.
- Course of the ribs: Running downwards from dorsal to ventral
- Intercostal space: Space between the ribs
- Connection to the sternum: costal cartilage (= Cartilago costalis)
    - 1.–7. Ribs: Directly connected to their costal cartilage with the sternum ("true" ribs = Costae verae)
    - 8–10. Ribs: Indirectly connected to the sternum through their costal cartilage ("false" ribs = Costae spuriae)
    - 11.–12. Rib: Ends free ("free" ribs = Costae fluctuantes)

> [!NOTE] Cervical rib and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
> Due to a disturbance in the formation of the ribs, a so-called "cervical rib" can develop in some individuals at the seventh cervical vertebra instead of the tuberculum anterius. If such a cervical rib is very long, it can lead to a thoracic outlet syndrome. This term encompasses compression syndromes that arise because the lower fibers of the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery must traverse over the cervical rib at a very sharp angle on their way to the axilla. Various movements, such as carrying a suitcase, can further compress the structures against the cervical rib, resulting in circulatory disturbances (e.g., pallor, pulselessness, pain) and sensory disturbances (e.g., dysesthesias and muscle weakness). In cases of mild symptoms, a conservative therapeutic approach through physiotherapy is usually initiated first. However, if the symptoms do not improve as a result, surgical resection of the cervical rib may be performed. Analogous to the cervical rib, a so-called lumbar rib can also occur at the first lumbar vertebra due to a faulty rib formation instead of the processus costalis.

### Sternum

The sternum (= breastbone) is a flattened bone that consists of three sections.

- Sections of the sternum
    - Manubrium sterni (= Handle): Attachment for the clavicle, 1st rib and half of the cartilage of the 2nd rib
    - Body of the sternum (= sternum body): Attachment for the cartilage of the 2nd to 7th ribs
    - Xiphoid process (= sword-like appendage)
- Glenoid cavities of the sternum
    - Clavicular notch
    - Costal notches I–VII
- Areas palpable through the skin
    - Jugular notch: Notch at the upper border of the manubrium of the sternum
    - Angle of the sternum: Projection at the junction of the manubrium sterni and the corpus sterni
    - Xiphoid process
## Joints and Ligaments of the Ribs

The rib joints serve the mechanics of breathing and are reinforced by several ligaments.

### Rippengelenke

#### Costovertebral Joints (= Articulationes costovertebrales)

- Rib head joint (= Articulatio capitis costae): Connects the rib head with the thoracic vertebral body.
- Costotransverse joint (= Articulatio costotransversaria): Connects the tubercle of the 1st to 10th rib with the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae.

#### Sternoclavicular Joints

The ribs 8 to 10 are only indirectly connected to the sternum; their cartilage extends to the cartilage of the 7th rib, forming the costal arch.

- 1st, 6th, and 7th rib: synchondroses
- 2.–5. Ribs: Sternocostal joints (= Sternocostal articulations)

### Ligaments of the Costovertebral Joints

There are some reinforcing bands that connect the rib joints to the thoracic vertebrae and the sternum.

- Ligamentum capitis costae intraarticulare: Connects the 2nd to 10th rib with the intervertebral disc and divides the joint cavities into two halves.
- Radiate ligament of the head of the rib: Connects the 2nd to 10th rib with the thoracic vertebra body.
- Ligamentum costotransversarium superius: Connects the costal tubercle with the transverse process of the next higher thoracic vertebra.
- Costotransverse ligament lateral: Connects the tubercle of the rib with the transverse process of the thoracic vertebra of the same segment.
- Radiate sternocostal ligament: Extends from the costal cartilage to the ventral side of the sternum and radiates into the joint capsule.
- Intra-articular sternocostal ligament: Divides the joint cavity at the sternum for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th ribs into two halves.

### Mechanics of Rib Joints

The joints of the ribs support inspiration and expiration. Due to their anatomical shape, the rib head and sternocostal joints are ball-and-socket joints, and the rib transverse process joints are hinge joints. Functionally, however, the rib joints are significantly less mobile due to their tight ligamentous fixation.

- Inspiration (Inhalation): Rotation of the costovertebral joints → Elevation of the sternal ends of the ribs → Increase in thoracic volume
- Expiration: Lowering of the sternal rib ends → Thorax becomes flatter and narrower → Volume of the thorax decreases

> [!NOTE]
> During inspiration, the rib cartilage is elastically deformed and the ligaments are tightened. The elastic restoring forces of these structures can then assist with expiration!

> [!NOTE] Thorax shapes
> Kids physiologically have a very broad thorax with a slight inclination of the upper thoracic aperture. As they age, the ribs lower and the upper part of the thorax leans forward (= thoracic kyphosis). Since the ribs are connected to the sternum and the thoracic spine via joints, deformations of the spine always lead to a change in the thoracic shape. A very common thoracic deformity is the so-called pectus excavatum. This is a genetically conditioned malformation, where there is a funnel-shaped indentation of the anterior thoracic wall, particularly below the sternum. In most cases, this primarily represents a cosmetic impairment (possibly accompanied by a psychological burden). However, to counteract potential cardiopulmonary complaints, patients should start breathing exercises and physical therapy early on.

## Intercostal Muscles and Fascia

### Intercostal Muscles

The musculature in the intercostal spaces serves to seal these spaces on one hand, and on the other hand, it plays an important role in the mechanics of breathing. Between the Mm. intercostales interni and Mm. intercostales intimi runs the connective tissue compartment of the intercostal vessels and nerves, which separates the two muscles from each other.

| **Muscle**                       | **Origin**                                                    | **Approach**                                                                                         | **Innervation**                   | **Function**                                                               |

> [!NOTE]
> The chest wall muscles that lift the ventral part of the ribs are responsible for inspiration, and those that lower this part are responsible for expiration!

### Fascia

The chest wall is covered externally by the external thoracic fascia and internally by the endothoracic fascia.

- Thoracic fascia externa: Covers the periosteum of the ribs and the external intercostal muscles.
- Endothoracic fascia
    - Separation of the intercostal muscles from the thoracic organs
    - Cranial transition into the prevertebral lamina and caudal into the transversalis fascia
    - Covers peripheral areas of the diaphragm
    - Transition to the parietal pleura of the lung and the diaphragm
## Conduction Paths

The supply of the chest wall is primarily provided by the so-called intercostal vessels, which are conduits that run in the intercostal spaces. Accordingly, there is an intercostal artery, an intercostal vein, and an intercostal nerve in each intercostal space. These structures run along the lower border of the ribs, where they are guided through the costal groove. The internal thoracic artery and vein also play an important role in the arterial supply and venous drainage of the anterior chest wall.

## Projection of the Thoracic Organs

The thoracic organs project onto specific areas of the thoracic wall, whereby the position of the heart and lungs can be roughly estimated by tapping on the chest wall (percussion).

### Projection of the Heart

| **Position** | **Projection of the Heart on the Thorax**                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Right Cranial** | Approximates 3rd rib, 2 cm parasternal right                        |
| **Right Caudal**  | Approximates 6th rib, 2 cm parasternal right                        |
| **Left Cranial**  | Approximates 3rd rib, 2 cm parasternal left                         |
| **Left Caudal**   | 5th intercostal space on the left, 2 cm medial to the midclavicular line |

> [!NOTE]
> For the projection of the heart valves and the auscultation of the heart sounds, see LK examination methods in cardiology.

#### Cardiac Damping

You can estimate heart size and heart position by percussion of the thorax. The principle is based on the fact that the percussion sound is muffled over the heart and can be well distinguished from the air-filled lung, where the percussion sound is sonorous (hollow and loud).

- Absolute heart damping
    - Relationship to the thorax: The heart lies directly against the thoracic wall.
    - Knock sound: Dull
- Relative heart damping
    - Relationship to the thorax: Lung tissue lies between the heart and the thoracic wall.
    - Percussion sound: Sonorous

### Projection of the Lung and the Diaphragm

In the projection of the lung, a distinction is made between the resting position of the breath and the position during the breathing phases (breath mobility).

#### Breathing Shiftability

The lung borders change depending on the phase of respiration. During inspiration, they are lower, and during expiration, they are higher, as the lungs passively adjust to the height changes of the diaphragm.

#### Lung lobe boundaries

- Since in some diseases not the entire lung but only individual lobes may be affected (e.g., in the so-called lobar pneumonia), it is important to distinguish the individual lung lobe boundaries as well. They run diagonally from back-top to front-bottom.
    - Upper lobe-lower lobe boundary (= oblique fissure): Begins dorsally at the level of the spine of the scapula and runs anteriorly to the cartilage-bone boundary of the 6th rib.
    - Upper lobe-middle lobe boundary (= horizontal fissure): Follows its course approximately along the right 4th rib.
- For auscultation of the lung: See clinical examination of the lung

> [!NOTE] Percussion of the lung
> Since the lung is an air-filled space, its tissue can be well assessed through percussion. A healthy lung produces a "resonant percussion sound" when tapped, meaning a relatively hollow and loud tone. If the sound is louder and hollower than normal (hyper-resonant percussion sound), this indicates an excessive air content in the lung (e.g., in bronchial asthma or a pneumothorax). If the percussion sound is duller and quieter than that of a healthy lung (hypo-resonant percussion sound), this indicates an increased fluid content in the lung (e.g., in pneumonia or a pleural effusion). However, the percussion field of the lung, which is the area that can be assessed through percussion, does not correspond to the entire extent of the lung, as only well-ventilated areas produce a resonant percussion sound. The respiratory mobility of the lung borders can be well assessed with lung percussion. For this, the surface of the body over the lung borders is tapped for comparison once during deep inspiration and once during expiration.

## Development of the Thoracic Skeleton

### Development of the Ribs

- Development from blastemas
    - The rib blastema is formed by scleroderma cells that have migrated into the somatopleura.
    - A segmental division of the chest wall is created: ribs are unisegmental structures.
    - Ossification of the ribs: Starting at the end of the 2nd embryonic month
        - Begins enchondral in the area of the costal angle
        - Proceeds ventrally forward
        - The sternal ends remain cartilaginous.
        - During puberty, bone nuclei develop in the rib head and in the costal tubercle.
        - By adulthood, the bone cores fuse with the bony rib body.

### Development of the Sternum

- Development from two separate blastemas (= sternal ridges)
    - The ends of the true ribs touch the blastema.
    - This connects the two sternal bars from cranial to caudal.
    - Ossification of the sternum: Begins in the 6th fetal month
        - Begins in a core of the manubrium sterni and in the 6–12 cores of the corpus sterni
        - Ossification continues until puberty.
        - The cartilaginous synchondroses between the manubrium sterni, corpus sterni, and processus xiphoideus can persist until the age of 40.
## Review Questions for the Chapter on Chest Wall
### Bony Structure

What is the so-called angulus sterni and which rib does it serve as an attachment point?
- The angulus sterni is a palpable elevation at the transition from the manubrium sterni to the body of the sternum. The 2nd rib attaches to it, which is why it serves as a reference point for counting the ribs and determining the position of the intercostal spaces.

### Joints and Ligaments of the Ribs

Which structures articulate with each other in the two costovertebral joints?
- The two costovertebral joints connect the ribs with the thoracic vertebrae. The rib head joint (Art. capitis costae) connects the rib head with the thoracic vertebral body. The costotransverse joint (Art. costotransversaria) connects the tuberculum costae of the 1st to 10th rib with the transverse processes of the respective thoracic vertebrae.

### Conduits

In what arrangement and with what reference to the associated rib do the intercostal vessels and nerves run?
- The intercostal vessels and nerves run in the costal groove at the lower edge of the ribs from cranial to caudal in the following order: intercostal vein, intercostal artery, corresponding intercostal nerve.

### Projection of the Thoracic Organs

Along which ribs do the oblique fissure and the horizontal fissure of the lung approximately run?
- The lobar boundaries of the lungs run obliquely from posterior-superior to anterior-inferior. The boundary between the upper and lower lobes (= oblique fissure) starts dorsally at the level of the scapular spine and runs ventrally to the cartilage-bone junction of the 6th rib. The boundary between the upper and middle lobes (= horizontal fissure) exists only on the right side and roughly follows the 4th rib.

Where do the pleural domes project in relation to the ventral wall of the rib cage?
- The pleural domes project onto the ventral wall of the thorax about 2 cm above the clavicle.

At which rib levels do the caudal pleural and lung borders intersect the scapular, midclavicular, and midaxillary lines (in a state of rest during breathing)?
- Due to the oblique course of the caudal pleural and lung borders, the intersections with the vertical reference lines of the upper body lie at different rib levels. On the scapular line, the caudal margin of the pleura is roughly at the level of the 11th rib, the lung border at the level of the 10th rib. The midclavicular line intersects the caudal pleural and lung borders at rest at the level of the 7th and 6th rib, respectively. The intersections of the midaxillary line with the lower borders of the pleura and lung lie approximately at the levels of the 9th and 8th rib.
