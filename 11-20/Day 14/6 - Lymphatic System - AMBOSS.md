# Lymphatic System
## Summary

The lymphatic system consists of the lymphatic organs and the lymphatic vessel system. The lymphatic organs can be further divided into primary and secondary lymphatic organs. In the primary lymphatic organs, the formation, development, and maturation of immune cells occur. These include the bone marrow, which is responsible for blood cell formation and the maturation of B lymphocytes, and the thymus, where the maturation of T lymphocytes takes place. The secondary lymphatic organs represent limited spaces for immune defense, where mature lymphocytes interact with antigens and thereby differentiate into effector cells. These include, in addition to the lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue, the spleen, which is also responsible for blood cell turnover.

The lymphatic system is, alongside the blood vascular system, a second transport system of the body. It plays an important role in the return of interstitial fluid to the bloodstream, immune defense, and nutrient transport. The lymph nodes are interposed in the lymphatic system as immunological control stations. Clinically, the lymphatic system is also of great importance, as it can lead to lymphatic metastases in the context of tumor diseases, for example.
## Primary lymphatic organs

As primary lymphatic organs, those in which the formation and maturation of immune cells take place are referred to. The goal is the production of immunocompetent lymphocytes that are capable of recognizing and binding antigens. Compared to secondary lymphatic organs, the primary lymphatic organs therefore play a superior role; however, they are not directly involved in immune defense.
The primary lymphatic organs include bone marrow and thymus.

### Bone Marrow

The bone marrow is located as soft tissue inside all bones. It serves as the central organ of hematopoiesis. In addition, it is also an important site for the immune system. As a primary lymphatic organ, the formation of immune cells (leukopoiesis) as well as the maturation of B-lymphocytes occurs here. For detailed information, see: bone marrow

> [!NOTE]
> While the B cells also complete their maturation in the bone marrow, the immature T lymphocytes migrate to the thymus for maturation!

> [!NOTE]
> Lymphocyte maturation: B-lymphocytes - Bone marrow, T-lymphocytes - Thymus!

### Thymus

The thymus is a relatively small primary lymphatic organ located in the upper mediastinum. Here, the maturation of T precursor cells into mature naive T cells occurs.

#### Macroscopic Anatomy

##### Profile

- Function: Primary lymphatic organ (maturation of T-lymphocytes)
- Location: In the upper mediastinum
- Shape: Bilobular
- Size: Dependent on age (largest expansion during puberty; progressive involution over time)
- Weight: Puberty: approx. 30g, Adulthood: approx. 18g

##### Structure and Form

The thymus is a lymphoepithelial soft organ located in the mediastinum. It has a bilobed shape with two asymmetrical lobes (lobi) that taper off caudally. The thymus is surrounded by a delicate connective tissue capsule, whose extensions subdivide the lobes into smaller lobules (lobuli).

- Capsule (= Capsule): Vascular delicate capsule made of connective tissue
- Lobes (= Flaps): Are interconnected
    - Lobus dexter: Right Lobe
    - Lobus sinister: Left Lobe
- Lobules (= Lobuli): Projections of the connective tissue capsule form vascular septa that subdivide the lobes into smaller lobules.
- Parenchyma: It is divided into a darker, cell-rich cortex and a lighter, cell-poorer medulla.

##### Involution of the Thymus

The size of the thymus changes over the course of life depending on age.

1. Until puberty: Maximum expansion of the organ (30g)
2. From puberty to the 5th decade of life: Physiological regression (= age involution) → Thymus tissue replaced by adipose tissue
3. From the 5th decade of life: Only a small remainder of thymus tissue remains → Differentiation of immature T-cells is also ensured into old age (18g)

> [!NOTE]
> The thymus is an organ of childhood and adolescence; however, a small remnant remains even into old age!

##### Topography

The thymus is located in the upper mediastinum and projects into the so-called "thymus triangle."

|Topography of the Thymus|   |
|---|---|
|Ventral Boundary|- Sternum|
|Dorsal Boundary|- Pericardium<br>- Large Vessels (Aorta, Pulmonary Trunk, Superior Vena Cava, Brachiocephalic Veins)|
|Lateral Boundary|- Mediastinal Pleura|

##### Vascular Supply and Innervation

Due to its position in the upper mediastinum, the thymus is primarily supplied by the cranial mediastinal vessels.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Thymic branches from the internal thoracic artery|
|Venous|- Thymic veins in Brachiocephalic veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Parasympathetic|- Recurrent laryngeal nerve from the vagus nerve|
|Sympathetic|- Branches from cervical ganglia|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Afferents: The thymus has no afferent lymphatic vessels compared to the lymph nodes.<br>- Efferents: Nll. brachiocephalici in Trunci bronchomediastinales|

#### Microscopic Anatomy

The fine structure of the thymus is characterized by the division of the parenchyma into cortex and medulla. While the cortex is dominated by immature T-lymphocytes (thymocytes), the medulla mainly contains thymic epithelium.

- Basic structure of the parenchyma: Specialized thymic epithelium that forms a three-dimensional network for the embedded maturing T-lymphocytes (thymocytes).
    - Cortex (Cortex)
        - Zellreich
        - Above all, densely packed immature T lymphocytes (thymocytes)
    - Mark (Medulla)
        - Zellarm
        - Above all thymic epithelium (only a few lymphocytes)
- Cellular fine structure
    - Thymocytes
        - Immature T lymphocytes that migrate from the hematopoietic organs to the thymus and mature there.
        - Through the blood vessels of the medulla, the matured T-lymphocytes leave the thymus again.
    - Thymic epithelium
        - Lies as a closed layer beneath the connective tissue capsule, separating the intrathymic space from the connective tissue capsule and its septa.
        - Over long extensions, these cells are connected to form a three-dimensional network.
            - Cell types: The thymic epithelium consists of two different cell types.
                - Cortical thymic epithelial cells that lie in the outer cortex and essentially envelop the thymocytes.
                - Hassall's corpuscles: Onion-skin-like arranged eosinophilic epithelial cells in the medulla, whose function is still unclear.
            - Blood-thymus barrier
                - The blood vessels enter through the connective tissue septa at the boundary between the medulla and cortex.
                - To shield the bark from the antigens circulating in the blood, the epithelial cells in this area form an epithelial sheath around the blood vessels.
                - Capillary endothelium and epithelial sheath are collectively referred to as the blood-thymus barrier.

> [!NOTE]
> Physiologically, there are no B lymphocytes in the thymus!

#### Function

The thymus is a primary lymphatic organ responsible for the maturation of T-lymphocytes into immune-competent, self-tolerant cells. Immature precursor cells migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus and initially remain there as thymocytes in the cortex. From there, they undergo several maturation steps and move into the thymic medulla. In over 90% of thymocytes, it becomes apparent during this maturation process that the T-cell receptor is not functioning properly or that the cells are autoreactive. These cells undergo apoptosis. The immune-competent, self-tolerant naive T-cells leave the thymic medulla via the bloodstream toward secondary lymphatic organs. For more information, see: Maturation of T-lymphocytes.

Role of the thymus in myasthenia gravis
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies are formed against the acetylcholine receptors of the motor end plate. As a result, patients experience pronounced weakness of the skeletal muscles, which can be life-threatening depending on the severity. In 50-60% of patients, the thymus is enlarged or there is a tumor of the thymus (thymoma). The underlying cause of this connection is probably that thymic epithelial cells exhibit acetylcholine-like antigens that could trigger the formation of autoreactive antibodies. The surgical removal of the thymus (thymectomy) or the thymoma leads to an improvement in symptoms or even healing in 50-80% of patients. The reason for this is not yet clearly understood.

#### Development

The thymus gland develops from the endoderm of the third pharyngeal pouch.

- 9th week: Lymphoid progenitor cells migrate from the fetal hematopoietic organs into the thymic epithelium and are now referred to as thymocytes.
- 17th week: The thymus is fully differentiated and is divided into a lymphocyte-rich cortex and a less cellular medulla.

> [!NOTE] DiGeorge Syndrome
> In DiGeorge syndrome, it is a genetic disorder where a microdeletion leads to a malformation of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches. In addition to a number of other malformations, this can result in the complete absence of the thymus (thymic aplasia) in the worst case. Due to the resulting disturbance in T-cell maturation, there is a massive immunodeficiency. Under sterile conditions, survival is possible today. A thymus transplant can potentially cure the patients.

## Secondary lymphatic organs

As secondary lymphatic organs, those are referred to that are visited by mature but naive B or T lymphocytes in search of a suitable antigen. In these organs, antigen presentation and recognition occur, as well as the subsequent differentiation of naive cells into effector cells. Secondary lymphatic organs thus represent a defined space of immune defense in which specific immune responses are initiated.
The secondary lymphatic organs include:

- Spleen
- Lymph nodes
- Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)

### Fundamentals of Secondary Lymphatic Organs

#### Function

The secondary lymphatic organs represent a defined location for specific immune defense. In them, antigen presentation and recognition, as well as the differentiation of naive T and B lymphocytes into effector cells, occur. This takes place roughly in several steps:

1. Migration of lymphocytes
    - Mature, naive T or B cells migrate into the bloodstream after leaving the primary lymphatic organs (bone marrow or thymus).
    - From there, they enter the bloodstream to the secondary lymphatic organs.
    - The transition occurs, except in the spleen, transendothelially via the high endothelial venules.
2. Antigen recognition and differentiation to effector cell (For more details see: Specific immune system)
3. Emigration of differentiated effector cells: The now differentiated mature effector cells leave the secondary lymphatic organs via efferent lymphatic vessels to reach the infectious agents and exert their specific immune response there.

#### Structure

Due to their similar function, the basic structure of the secondary lymphatic organs is also similar to one another.

- Framework: Reticular connective tissue with fibroblastic reticular cells and reticular fibers
- Outline
    - B-Zone: B-lymphocytes of the lymph follicles
        - The incoming B cells arrange themselves in the form of lymph follicles (primary and secondary lymph follicles) around so-called follicular dendritic cells (FDC).
            - Primary lymphoid follicle: Spherical accumulation of naive, resting B cells that have not yet encountered an antigen.
            - Secondary lymphoid follicle: Consist of two components and form after antigen contact.
                - Germ Center
                    - Appearance: Bright Zone (inside)
                        - Within the bright germinal center, a darker and a lighter region can be distinguished, in which the different stages of B cell differentiation occur (for more information see: affinity maturation)
                    - Function: Site of proliferation and antigen-dependent differentiation of activated, specialized B cells after antigen contact
                - Climatic zone
                    - Appearance: Dark Zone (outside)
                        - The inactive (naive) B cells are pushed to the periphery by the proliferating B lymphocytes and are histologically identifiable as a darker mantle zone.
    - T-Zone: Parafollicular T Lymphocytes
        - The incoming T cells group around so-called antigen-presenting interdigitating dendritic cells (IDCs) in order to be activated by them.
        - High endothelial venules: They are located parafollicularly in the T-zone of secondary lymphatic organs (exception: the spleen has no high endothelial venules!) and serve the recirculation of lymphocytes.

#### Recirculation of Lymphocytes

After their maturation in the primary lymphatic organs, the mature, naive lymphocytes frequently switch back and forth between the bloodstream and the periphery. This process occurs in several steps.

1. Leaving the bloodstream (Emigration)
    - Lymphocytes usually remain in the bloodstream for about one hour during their migration before leaving it to reach a target organ.
    - This occurs through different pathways depending on the target organ and generally proceeds in three steps:
        1. "Rolling" of leukocytes on the endothelium: Cytokine-mediated activation of the endothelium triggers the expression of cell adhesion molecules (selectins) on the endothelial surface.
        2. Adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium: Under the influence of chemokines, there is a binding between leukocyte integrins and endothelial adhesion molecules.
        3. Leukodiapedesis: Passage of leukocytes between the endothelial cells or translocation through the endothelial cells
            - Non-lymphatic tissues: Emigration through post-capillary venules
            - Lymphatic tissue: Emigration through specialized post-capillary venules (high endothelial venules)
2. Stay in the tissue
3. Exit of the tissue: Through the efferent lymphatic vessels of the tissue, the lymphocytes enter the main lymph trunks and reach the bloodstream via their junction with the venous angle.

#### Antigen delivery to the secondary lymphatic organs

The different structure of the secondary lymphatic organs can be explained by the various routes of antigen delivery.

- Lymph nodes: Antigen supply through the lymph (characteristic: numerous lymphatic afferent vessels and a well-developed lymph sinus system)
- Spleen: Antigen delivery via the bloodstream (Distinguishing feature: blood-filled red pulp)
- MALT system: Antigen delivery through the surface epithelium (marker: follicle-associated epithelium)

### Lymphatic System

The lymphatic system, alongside the circulatory system, is a second transport system of the body that has different functions: the return of interstitial fluid to the bloodstream, immune defense, and nutrient transport. Unlike the circulatory system, the lymphatic system is not a closed circuit. Due to the blind beginnings of the lymphatic capillaries and their incomplete wall structure, metabolic products as well as microorganisms or foreign substances can also enter the lymph. Therefore, the lymph nodes (secondary lymphatic organs) are interposed as immunological control stations in the lymphatic system.

### Function

The lymphatic system essentially has three functions.

1. Transport function: Returns a portion of the ultrafiltered interstitial fluid to the bloodstream.
2. Defense function
    - Microorganisms and foreign substances easily enter the lymphatic system due to the blind ends and high permeability of the lymph capillaries.
    - Supply of these potential pathogens to the lymph node stations
3. Lipid transport
    - The fats absorbed in the intestine as chylomicrons pass through the permeable endothelium of the lymph capillaries into the lymphatic system and are thus brought into the bloodstream.
    - The fatty lymph of the intestine is also referred to as chyle.

### Structure

Through the blind-starting lymph capillaries in the interstitial area of the organs, lymph flows into the larger lymph vessels. The merging of several lymph vessels forms the large lymph trunks, where the lymph from a specific body region is collected. It is then returned to the bloodstream through two central lymph ducts that empty into the left and right venous angles.

1. Lymph capillaries: The first and smallest section of the lymphatic system
    - Function: Absorption of interstitial fluid and dissolved substances
    - Location: Located in the interstitial connective tissue of the organs or in the dermis.
    - Structure: Blind-terminating tubes that form a network between the blood capillaries.
        - Wand construction
            - Flat incomplete endothelium
            - Missing or permeable basement membrane → Fluid from the interstitium, including proteins, fats, and possibly microorganisms, can easily be absorbed into the lymphatic system.
        - Special feature: Lymphatic capillaries are absent in bone marrow and cartilage tissue.
2. Lymph vessels (Vasa lymphatica or lymph collectors)
    - Function: Transport of lymph to the lymph node stations
    - Structure: The structure of a lymphatic vessel is similar to that of a vein, only with significantly thinner layers.
        - Vessel structure: Endothelium with basal lamina, thin muscle layer, and adventitia
        - Special feature: Like veins, lymphatic vessels have valves that facilitate the transport of lymph.
3. Lymph trunks (Trunci lymphatici): Usually arranged in pairs and individually named.
4. Lymphatic vessels (Lymph ducts): Thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct, which drain into the venous angle as the final section of the lymphatic circulation.

> [!NOTE]
> Lymphatic vessels also have valves that facilitate the transport of lymph!

### Topography

The lymphatic system can be divided into a superficial and a deep system. The superficial lymphatic system channels its lymph to the deep vascular system via perforating vessels. To do this, these vessels must penetrate the superficial fascia of the body. The connection between the superficial and deep systems is particularly pronounced in the area of the lateral neck, in the axilla, and in the inguinal region. There are especially many lymph nodes in these areas to effectively filter potential pathogens before they enter the deep system. These should always be examined during a physical examination, as they can provide clues to infections.

- Superficial lymphatic system
    - Course: Above the superficial fascia of the body
    - Drained areas: skin and subcutis
- Deep lymphatic system
    - Course: Below the superficial fascia of the body
    - Drained areas: All organs, muscles, nerves, and bones

### Overview of Lymph Drainage

The lymph drainage occurs from the small, blind-ending lymph capillaries through the larger lymph collecting vessels (Vasa lymphatica) into the usually paired lymph trunks. From there, the lymph from a body region is directed to the respective lymph ducts (Ductus lymphaticus dexter and Ductus thoracicus). As the main lymph vessels, they drain into the venous system of the circulatory system at the venous angle. The drive for lymph flow is, in addition to the autonomously controlled contraction of the lymph vessel musculature, also the muscle pump of the skeletal musculature and the arterial pulse wave. In the chest area, the thoracic pressure change during the respiratory excursion also facilitates lymph drainage.

- Thoracic duct: The thoracic duct begins as an enlarged cisterna chyli in the abdomen from the confluence of the intestinal trunks and lumbar trunks, and then ascends as a strong lymphatic vessel until it empties into the left venous angle just before the origin of the vertebral artery (from the subclavian artery).
    - Drained area: Collection of lymph from the entire lower body including the abdominal and pelvic organs, the left thorax including chest organs, the left arm, and the left half of the head.
    - Lymph inflows
        - Intestinal trunks: Drain the lymph of the unpaired abdominal organs (spleen, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract except for the descending colon, sigmoid, and from the orally located parts of the rectum)
            - Important lymph node stations
                - Celiac nodes: Located around the celiac trunk and drain the spleen, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and stomach.
                - Superior mesenteric nodes: Located at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and drain the jejunum, ileum, ascending colon, and transverse colon.
        - Lumbar trunks: Drain the lymph from the paired abdominal organs (kidneys, adrenal glands), all pelvic organs (including the descending colon, sigmoid, and oral parts of the rectum), abdominal wall, pelvic wall, and lower extremity.
            - Important lymph node stations
                - Inferior mesenteric nerves: They are located at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and drain the descending colon, sigmoid, and the oral rectal section.
                - Common iliac veins: They are located around the common iliac artery and drain the lower extremity as well as the pelvic organs.
                - Lumbar nerves right and left: Lie around the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava and drain the kidneys including the adrenal glands, the ovaries including the appendages, and the testes including the epididymis.
        - Left subclavian trunk: Drains the lymph from the left arm
        - Left jugular trunk: Drains the lymph from the left side of the head and the left neck.
        - Bronchomediastinal trunk on the left: Drains lymph from the left chest wall, thoracic organs, diaphragm, part of the liver(!), and mediastinum
        - Smaller unnamed lymphatic influxes with lymph from the mediastinum and the intercostal spaces
- Right lymphatic duct: Formed by the confluence of the right subclavian trunk, right jugular trunk, and right bronchomediastinal trunk, and drains as a lymph vessel only about 1cm long into the right venous angle.
    - Drained area: Collection of lymph from the right thorax including thoracic organs and the right arm as well as the lymph from the right half of the head.
    - Lymph inflows
        - Right subclavian trunk: Drains the lymph from the right arm
        - Right jugular trunk: Drains the lymph from the right side of the head and the right side of the neck.
        - Right bronchomediastinal trunk: Drains lymph from the right chest wall, thoracic organs, diaphragm, part of the liver(!), and mediastinum.
        - Smaller unnamed lymphatic influxes with lymph from the mediastinum and the intercostal spaces
## Lymph

### Overview

Lymph is the part of the interstitial fluid that is returned to the bloodstream via the lymphatic system.

- Color: White-yellow liquid, clear or cloudy depending on fat and protein content
- Quantity: Approx. 2-3l per day
- Components: Similar to interstitial fluid
    - Proteins: Numerous plasma proteins (especially after passing through the digestive organs and the liver, high protein content)
    - Lipids: Due to the lipid transport function, the content is high after passing through the digestive tract.
    - Coagulation factors and fibrinogen: Coagulation ability is similar to that of blood
    - Cellular components: In particular, immune system cells

### Origin

1. Filtration: Several liters of fluid exit the capillaries of the blood vessel system into the interstitium each day.
    - Underlying forces: Hydrostatic pressure vs. colloid osmotic pressure
    - For more detailed information on the formation of the filtrate, see: Effective Filtration Pressure.
2. Resorption: Of these approximately 20 liters of filtrate, most returns to the bloodstream through the microcirculation (capillary endstream).
3. Lymph formation: Only about 10% (2-3 liters per day) flows through the openly beginning lymph capillaries into the lymphatic circulation and is then referred to as lymph.
    - Due to the incomplete structure of the lymph capillaries, dissolved metabolic products, microorganisms, or foreign bodies can also be absorbed into the lymphatic system in addition to interstitial fluid.

> [!NOTE] Lymphedema
> A lymphedema can arise, for example, as a result of a lymphatic drainage disorder. The causes of such a drainage disorder are diverse. Most commonly, it occurs due to a narrowing or the absence of lymphatic vessels resulting from tumors, surgeries such as axillary dissection in breast cancer, or radiation therapies. Less commonly, a congenital malformation of the lymphatic vessels or an infection is the cause. Typically, the extremities are affected. Therapeutically, conservative treatment may focus on physical decongestive therapy or treatment of the underlying condition. In rarer cases, a surgical approach may also be indicated.

## Review Questions on the Lymphatic System Chapter
### Primary lymphatic organs

Which organs are considered the primary lymphatic organs and what are their functions?
- The primary lymphatic organs serve for the formation, development, and maturation of immune cells. These include the bone marrow and the thymus. While the formation of immune cells and the maturation of B lymphocytes take place in the bone marrow, the thymus is responsible for the maturation of T lymphocytes. The primary lymphatic organs are not involved in the direct immune defense.
In which anatomical space is the thymus located and which artery is primarily responsible for its blood supply?
- The thymus is located in the superior mediastinum and is mainly supplied arterially by the thymic branches (Rr. thymici) from the internal thoracic artery (A. thoracica interna).
How is the juvenile thymus histologically organized?
- The thymic parenchyma, divided into medulla and cortex, consists of a network of epithelial cells in which the maturing T lymphocytes are embedded. Epithelial cells and T lymphocytes are found both in the medulla and in the cortex. However, epithelial cells predominate in the medulla, whereas T lymphocytes predominate in the cortex. A characteristic feature of the thymus is also the Hassall's corpuscles located in the medulla; onion-shaped arranged, degenerated epithelial cells.
### Secondary lymphatic organs

Which organs are classified as secondary lymphatic organs and what common histological features do they possess?
- The secondary lymphatic organs include the lymph nodes, the spleen, and the mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT). All secondary lymphatic organs consist of a framework of reticular connective tissue as well as locally varying zones populated by B and T lymphocytes (B-zone and T-zone). The B lymphocytes preferentially arrange themselves in the form of (primary and secondary) lymph follicles.
Explain briefly the recirculation of leukocytes! Which section of the vascular system is particularly important in this context?
- Mature lymphocytes continuously change their location and circulate between the bloodstream and the periphery. They enter lymphatic or non-lymphatic tissue via the blood and return to the bloodstream via efferent lymphatic vessels. The transition from the blood into tissue takes place via postcapillary venules, which structurally resemble capillaries and have especially high permeability. Except for the spleen, specialized postcapillary venules are located within the secondary lymphatic organs. These so-called high endothelial venules lie parafollicularly within the T-zone.
### Lymphatic System

With which vessels do lymphatic vessels show histological similarities and why?
- Due to their thin-walled structure and the presence of valves, lymphatic vessels show histological similarities to veins.
Describe the sequence of sections of the lymphatic vessel system from the periphery to the venous angle!
- The lymphatic capillaries, which begin blindly, are the smallest sections of the lymph vessel. They absorb the interstitial fluid and then drain into larger lymph vessels (= vasa lymphatica). These conduct the lymph fluid into the lymph trunks (= trunci lymphatici) and finally into the two central lymphatic ducts (= ductus lymphatici). The lymphatic ducts drain into the left and right venous angle, thereby returning the lymph fluid to the blood circulation.
### Lymph

What is lymph made of?
- Lymph largely corresponds in its composition to the interstitial fluid and therefore contains, among other things, proteins, lipids, and cells of the immune system. Since coagulation factors and fibrinogen also belong to the components of lymph, lymph is capable of coagulation.
