# Structure of Matter
## Summary

A fundamental understanding of biological processes requires knowledge of how matter is structured. Starting from atoms and their building blocks, it is shown here how these atoms can bond through various mechanisms to form simple to very complex molecules.

Atoms with the same structure and consequently the same chemical behavior are grouped under a single element name. These elements are arranged in a table according to their number of protons and electrons in the periodic table of elements. The properties of an element can then be predicted from its position in the periodic table; moreover, elements in a column can be classified as a group with similar chemical behavior.

Substances, i.e., molecular amounts in gaseous, liquid, or solid form, rarely exist as pure substances, but are usually found as so-called mixtures. Due to their chemical and physical properties, these mixtures can be separated using some of the methods presented here.

## Atoms and Chemical Elements

Atoms were long considered the smallest particles (Gr. "atomos" = indivisible). However, today it is known that atoms themselves consist of even smaller particles, which are the fundamental building blocks of all matter. Many properties of chemical substances can be explained by the structure of atoms.

### Building Blocks of Atoms

- Definition: Atoms are made up of smaller building blocks, of which only the three most important are relevant to medical professionals and will be addressed here.
- Types: In chemistry, three types are important: protons, neutrons, electrons.
- Properties
    - Mass: Neutrons and protons each have a mass of 1 u
        - Unit: u (Unit, 1 u = 1/12 of the mass of the carbon atom)
        - Relative atomic mass: Since the mass of an atom is always expressed in relation to the mass of the carbon atom using the unit "u," it is not an absolute value but rather a relative mass indication.
    - Charge: The electron has a negative charge of 1e, protons have a positive charge that is equal in magnitude to the charge of the electrons.
        - Unit: e (elementary charge), the smallest unit of electric charge that occurs
    - Spin
        - Electrons: They move permanently in space and also rotate around their own axis. The angular momentum of this intrinsic rotation is called spin.
        - Nucleus: The nucleus of atoms can also have a total spin. When the number of protons and neutrons is odd, the nuclei behave like small magnets (magnetic dipole moment). This phenomenon is utilized in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

|Elementary Particles|Mass|Charge|
|---|---|---|
|Protons|1 u|+ e|
|Neutrons|1 u|0|
|Electrons|5.5x10^-4 u|- e|
> [!note]
> Chemists approximately calculate the relative atomic mass of an element as the sum of all protons and neutrons.

### Atom

Before the discovery of elementary particles, atoms were considered the smallest components of matter. They are made up of a nucleus and a shell, with the shell being up to 150,000 times larger than the nucleus.

- Structure: Atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus and a negatively charged electron shell.
- Properties
    - Charge: In the neutral basic form, atoms are uncharged.
    - Shape: Nearly spherical
- Classification: Atoms are systematically arranged in the so-called periodic table of elements (see below).
    - Element: Atoms that have the same structure and therefore behave chemically the same are grouped under the collective term "Element."
    - Nomenclature: Designation by element symbols, usually the initial letters of the name are taken in Latin or Greek writing: For example, calcium = Ca; oxygen (Latin: oxygenium, from Greek: oxys = "acid" and genesis = "to become") = O; bromine = Br; silver (Latin: argentum) = Ag

#### Atomic Nucleus

Atom nuclei consist of protons and neutrons, which are also referred to as nucleons (nuclear particles). The number of protons determines an atom's affiliation to an element. However, the number of neutrons can vary. Atoms that all belong to an element due to their number of protons, but have different numbers of neutrons, are called isotopes.

- Construction
    - Number of protons: The type of an atom or element is defined by the number of protons, which is also known as the atomic number.
    - Number of neutrons: Is usually equal to the number of protons, but can vary slightly.
        - Isotope (a form of nuclides): Atoms that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.
            - Nomenclature: To distinguish atoms or nuclides, the nucleon number is written above the element symbol and the proton number is written below the element.
                - Ex.: 116C, 126C, 146C, 168O
            - Stability: Different isotopes are of varying stability. For example, carbon occurs in the natural isotopes 12C, 13C, and 14C, where 12C and 13C are stable and 14C is unstable.
                - Proton excess: If there are more protons than neutrons in the atomic nucleus, resulting in a strong positive charge that is not well shielded, then the isotope is unstable and tends to reduce the proton excess by converting protons into neutrons (so-called β+-radiation)
                - Neutron excess: Many larger nuclei require an excess of neutrons to be stable. However, a neutron excess can also be energetically unfavorable, causing the respective isotope to tend to convert the excess neutrons into protons (so-called β--decay).
            - Radioactive decay: Unstable nuclides decay by emitting radiation, which is why they are referred to as "radioactive." For details, see: Ionizing radiation
            - Isotopic mixtures: Most elements have multiple isotopes and therefore occur as isotopic mixtures. They are described by the atomic mass of the isotopic mixture.
                - Calculation: The atomic mass of an isotope mixture can be calculated by multiplying the frequency of each isotope by its atomic mass and adding all the values together.
- Properties
    - Charge
        - The atomic nucleus is positively charged.
        - Its charge size corresponds to the number of protons, which is also referred to as the atomic number.
        - In an atom, the positive charge of the nucleus corresponds to the negative total charge of the electron shell.
    - Mass
        - The atomic nucleus is indeed very compact, but it accounts for almost the entire mass of an atom.
        - Its relative atomic mass approximately corresponds to the number of nucleons (nucleon number = mass number).

> [!note] Isotopes in Medicine
> Many radioactive isotopes are used in medicine, both as therapeutics and in diagnostics. Radioactive iodine (131I) is administered, for example, because it selectively accumulates in the thyroid gland. There it can be used as a therapeutic agent in radioiodine therapy, among other things, for thyroid cancer. The radiation emitted by 131I produces locally free radicals that destroy the DNA of the cells, leading to their death and breakdown. Since this destructive effect naturally affects not only cancer cells but also healthy cell material, the previously standard radioiodine test for diagnosing thyroid diseases is now used only very limitedly.

#### Atomic Shell

In the atom's shell, there are electrons that balance the positive charge of the nucleus with their negative charges. To describe the structure of the atom's shell, various models have been developed, each addressing different aspects of electron movement.

- Structure: The shell is formed by the electrons, and in a neutral atom, the number of electrons corresponds to the number of protons in the nucleus.
- Properties
    - Charge: The atomic shell is negatively charged.
    - Mass: The shell is indeed significantly larger than the compact core, but its mass is negligible.
- Models for the distribution of electrons in the shell: Electrons are negatively charged particles that repel each other. Therefore, they can only coexist in the shell under certain conditions. These conditions are described by two models.
    - Bohr's atomic model: Electrons move around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits (shells). From the inside out, the shells are designated as follows:
        - K-shell: 2 electrons
        - L-shell: 8 electrons
        - M-shell: 18 electrons
        - N-shell: 32 electrons
    - Atomic orbital model: Describes the distribution of electrons within the various shells
        - Basic assumption: Electrons do not move in fixed paths, but in variously shaped regions of the shells, which are called atomic orbitals (AO)
        - Atomic orbital types: The following orbital types are distinguished by their shape
            - s-Orbital (spherical)
            - p-Orbitals (dumbbell-shaped)
            - d-orbital (crossed double dumbbell)
        - Atomic orbital occupancy
            - Pauli Principle: In each AO, there are a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins.
            - Electron configuration: Describes the distribution of electrons in the atomic orbitals in the shell.

                1. First, the shell closest to the core is filled, as it is the most energetically favorable.
                2. In this process, each AO type of the respective shell is first occupied by an electron.
                3. When there is one electron in each AO of the shell, it starts over and a second electron with opposite spin (Pauli principle) enters each AO.

                - Example: Electron configuration of manganese: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d5
- Valence electrons: Valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost shell of an atom. With these, atoms form bonds with other atoms.
- Octet rule: Elements are particularly stable when their valence electron configuration leads to the outer shell of the atom being completely filled. For hydrogen, this is achieved with 2 electrons; all other elements require 8 valence electrons.

### Ions

If an atom or a molecule releases or accepts electrons, the number of electrons no longer corresponds to the number of protons. This results in a charged particle, which is called an ion. The formation of ions is not voluntary; energy must be supplied for an ion to form. This energy is called ionization energy when electrons are released, and electron affinity when electrons are accepted.

- Definition: An ion is a charged atom or molecule.
- Classification: Ions are distinguished by their charge into
    - Anions: Ions with a negative charge
    - Cations: Ions with a positive charge
- Origin
    - By the transfer or acceptance of electrons
    - By the addition or release of protons (H+)
    - Ionization energy: Energy that must be expended to remove one (or more) electrons from an atom (formation of cations)
        - This energy increases with every existing total charge of the atom.
        - The ionization energy decreases the further the electron is from the nucleus.
    - Electron affinity: Energy that must be expended (or is released) when electrons attach to an atom (formation of anions)
- Reactivity: Generally, ions are less stable than atoms, which means they react more easily than atoms.
    - Stabilizing influences
        - Noble gas configuration: Ions whose electron configuration corresponds to a completed shell are relatively stable.
            - The common stable ions have noble gas configuration (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, Cl-, ...)
        - Resonance stabilization: When the ion charge can be distributed over more than one atom, the ions are also particularly stable, e.g. in the case of acid anions.
        - Resonance (Chemistry): Ions whose charge density is localized on different atoms are more stable than others, e.g. the negative charge of acid anions.
    - The higher the charge, the higher the reactivity.

## Periodic Table of Elements

In the periodic table of elements (PSE), the over one hundred different elements are arranged according to various criteria such as atomic number and the configuration of valence electrons. It is therefore a useful tool for obtaining information about the properties of the different elements.

### Order Criteria in the PSE

The structure of the periodic table of elements is based on the building blocks of the respective atoms. The following criteria emerge for the structure:

- Order of elements: Elements are sorted by increasing atomic number (= nuclear charge number)
- Periods (Rows): For every shell that is filled with electrons, a new row in the periodic table is started.
- Groups (columns): All elements that are aligned in a column have the same valence electron configuration.
    - Main groups: Here, electrons are added to s- or p-orbitals.
        - Groups 1+2: Here, electrons are filled into the s-orbitals of the different shells, meaning that elements of Group 1 have one valence electron, while elements of Group 2 have two.
        - Groups 13-18: Here, electrons are filled into the p orbitals of the various shells.
    - Transition Metals: Here, electrons are added to d-orbitals (Groups 3-12)
- Empty spaces in the periodic table: Small shells do not have room for all types of orbitals, which is why there are empty spaces in the first periods of the periodic table.

> [!note]
> In the periodic table of elements, the columns are referred to as groups and the rows as periods. The atomic number increases within a group from top to bottom and within a period from left to right!

### Trends in the Periodic Table

Through the sorting of the elements, some elemental properties systematically change within the periodic table. The main trends are summarized as follows:

|Property|Trend in the Periodic Table|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|Atomradius|Increases from top to bottom and decreases from left to right|The size of the atom increases with the number of electrons that form the shell, i.e., the atomic radius within a group in the periodic table increases from top to bottom. However, within a period from left to right, the number of nuclear charges also increases, causing the electrons in the shell to be attracted more strongly, and the atomic radius decreases from left to right.<br><br>- The size of an atom increases with the number of electrons that form the shell<br>- The size of the atom decreases within a period (= from left to right) due to the increasing number of nuclear charges|
|Ion radius|- Increases from top to bottom<br>- Decreases from left to right|The size of the ion depends on the size of the atom from which it is formed (see atomic radius) and its charge:<br><br>- The size of an ion increases with the number of occupied orbitals<br>    - In each period, a new orbital is added → Within a group, the ion radius increases<br>    - The charge affects the number of valence electrons → Within a period, anions are larger than cations<br>- The size of an ion decreases with increasing nuclear charge|
|Ionization energy|Increases from left to right and simultaneously from bottom to top|With increasing nuclear charge (due to an increasing number of protons in the nucleus), the electrons in the shell are more tightly bound to the nucleus. It becomes harder to remove them, and more energy must be expended for ionization.|
|Electronegativity|Increases from bottom left to top right|Electronegativity, or the ability to strongly bind electrons, increases with increasing nuclear charge and decreases the further the free atomic orbital is from the nucleus.|
|Metallic Character|Increases from top to bottom and from right to left|The metallic character includes typical metal properties such as metallic luster, ductility, and malleability, as well as good electrical and thermal conductivity. Its trend correlates negatively with electronegativity and ionization energy, meaning that metallic character increases with decreasing electronegativity and ionization energy. The elements can be categorized based on this characteristic into three groups:<br><br>- Metal<br>- Metalloid<br>- Non-metal|

> [!note]
> The metallic character of an element is not a clearly defined quantity, which is why the distinction between metal, metalloid, and non-metal is often not unambiguous!

### Element Groups and Their Properties

Within the different groups in the periodic table, similar properties occur. For some groups, these are more pronounced than for others.

|Group Number|Group Names|Elements|Characteristic Properties|
|---|---|---|---|
|1. Group|Alkali Metals|H, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs|- Form cations of the form A+<br>- Elements are reactive, primarily reacting vigorously with water|
|2. Group|Alkaline Earth Metals|Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra|- Form cations of the type A2+<br>- Are less reactive than alkali metals|
|3. - 12. Group|Transition metals|including Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mo, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Hg|- Metals (e.g., heavy metals and noble metals)<br>- Form cations of different oxidation states (see also: Chemical reactions, → Oxidation number)<br>- Compounds are often colored|
|13. Group|Earth Metals|B, Al, Ga, In, Tl|- Lightweight Metals (these are true metals, but they have a lower density than other metals such as iron)<br>- Boron is the only metalloid, all other elements have metallic character<br>- Mainly form ions of the type A3+|
|14. Group|Tetrele|C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb|- Carbon is the only non-metal in the group, silicon and germanium are metalloids, all others are metals<br>- Chemical properties in this group have little similarity (due to the change in metallic character)|
|15. Group|Pnictogens|N, P, As, Sb, Bi|- Elements tend to be 3-valent or 5-valent<br>- N and P are non-metals, As and Sb are metalloids, Bi is a metal|
|16. Group|Chalcogens|O, S, Se, Te, Po|- O, S, and Se are nonmetals, all others are metalloids<br>- Often form ions in which they mainly have an oxidation state of -2<br>- Compounds of these elements are often poorly soluble|
|17. Group|Halogens|F, Cl, Br, I, At|- Form anions of the kind X-<br>- Very reactive elements|
|18. Group|Noble Gases|He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn|- All compounds in this group are gaseous and exist as individual atoms<br>- Do not form ions, as they have a complete electron shell<br>- Very unreactive|

### The most important elements in medicine

Many elements of the periodic table also have significance in medicine. In addition to the main building blocks of biological matter, which are summarized in the table below, there are also elements whose importance as electrolytes is considerable (see: water and electrolyte balance) or as trace elements.

|Element|Symbol|Important Properties|Significance for Medicine|
|---|---|---|---|
|Hydrogen|H|- Element: H2 = a colorless, odorless gas<br>- Important ions: H+, the so-called proton|- Atom percent in the body: ∼63%<br>- Component of<br>    - Water molecules<br>    - Almost all biomolecules in the backbone and in functional groups<br>- Properties<br>    - Bonds of hydrogen with other elements are generally easily polarizable<br>    - Forms very strong bonds with C and N; the C-H and N-H bonds therefore limit the reactivity of the respective C and N atoms.<br>- Special<br>    - The pH value is defined as the negative, decimal logarithm of the concentration of protons (H+-ions)<br>    - Protons are freely movable<br>        - Example: In the mitochondria, they create a gradient that is used during respiration for the production of ATP.<br>    - Hydrogen nuclei are usually excited in MRI because hydrogen is the numerically dominant element in the human body.|
|Oxygen|O|- Element: O2, colorless gas<br>- Important ions: OH- (hydroxide), H3O+ (hydronium), O2- (oxo-ion) is not actually stable| - Atomic percentage in the body: ∼25%<br><br>With 61% share of human body weight, oxygen is the element with the highest mass percentage<br><br>- Component of<br>    - Air (∼21%) → Enables respiration!<br>    - Water molecules<br>    - Many biomolecules, e.g. sugars, amino acids, DNA and RNA bases<br>        - Functional groups: Especially as alcohol, acid, and keto groups|
|Carbon|C|- Element: C, e.g. as graphite or as diamond<br>- Important ions: HCO3- (bicarbonate), CO32- (carbonate)|- Atom percent in the body: ∼9%<br>    - With 23% of total human body weight, carbon is the element with the second highest mass percentage<br>- Component of<br>    - Almost all biomolecules in the basic structure and in functional groups, therefore also involved in all tissues and all metabolic processes.<br>    - As gases, also in the air<br>        - CO2 (carbon dioxide)<br>        - CH4 (methane)|
|Nitrogen|N|- Element: N2 = colorless and odorless gas<br>- Important ions: NO3- (nitrate), NO+ (nitrosyl)|- Atomic percentage in the body: ∼1%<br>- Component of<br>    - Main component of the air (78%)<br>    - Many biomolecules, e.g. amino acids, DNA and RNA bases<br>        - Functional groups: Mainly amino group, nitrates, or in heterocycles<br>- Special<br>    - NO is an endogenous neurotransmitter that also has vasodilatory effects|

## Chemical Bonds

Elements usually do not occur in their atomic form, but combine into larger units such as molecules. This occurs through four different basic types of bonds, between which there are fluid transitions. The name of a substance usually indicates what type of bond it involves.

|Binding Type|   |Products|
|---|---|---|
|Ionic Bond|   |Salts|
|Atomic bond|Covalent bond|Molecules|
|Complex binding|Complexes|
|Metal Bonding|   |Metals|
|Van der Waals Bond|   |Large spatial structures (e.g., DNA double helix, H2O) or spatial influence within molecules (secondary structure of proteins)|

### Ionic Bonding

When an electropositive particle (a particle with pronounced metallic character) binds with an electronegative particle (a particle with pronounced non-metallic character), this usually occurs through an ionic bond:

- Binding force: Electrostatic attraction between differently charged ions
- Binding properties: Non-directional (i.e., equally strong in all spatial directions)
- Product: Salts
    - Structure
        - To balance the negative charge of an anion, cations gather around the anion and vice versa → Strongly ordered spatial structure (lattice structure)
    - Appearance
        - Form good crystals due to the ordered lattice structure.
        - Solids are hard and brittle.
        - Mostly colorless
    - Physical Properties
        - High melting and boiling points
        - Dissolve in aqueous solution into individual ions; for details see: solubility product
            - The solubility of salts in water varies greatly: Sodium chloride (table salt) and barium chloride are very soluble, whereas calcium carbonate (lime) and barium sulfate (heavy spar) are hardly soluble.
        - Conduct electricity in liquid form (thus in solution or as a melt), do not conduct electricity in solid form.

### Atomic Bonding

When two atoms with non-metallic character bond together, this usually occurs through a covalent bond (atomic bond).

- Bonding force: Formation of energetically favorable, shared molecular orbitals of two atoms, in which the electrons of the bonding partners pair.
- Theoretical explanation of molecular orbital formation: There are two models of explanation (see below for each)
    - According to valence bond theory
    - According to molecular orbital theory
- Binding properties
    - Spatially strongly oriented
    - No large spatial structures are formed as with salts or metals, but rather "discrete" molecules, i.e., small particles made up of several connected atoms, known as molecules.
    - Polarization of bonds
        - Arises when both bonding partners have very different electronegativity.
        - Electrons of the bond are pulled closer to the partner with high electronegativity → This atom is then partially negatively charged, while the other bonding partner is partially positively charged.
            - Intramolecular interactions: Polarized bonds form the basis for weak interactions between different parts within the same molecule.
            - Intermolecular interactions: Polarized bonds form the basis for weak interactions between molecules.
- Product: Molecules
    - Polarization of molecules or molecular parts
        - Occurs when parts (functional groups) of molecules exhibit varying electron densities or possess highly polarized bonds.
        - Molecules with two different charge centers (= partial charges) are called dipoles.
        - The strength of the charge displacement is indicated by the dipole moment.

> [!note]
> Partial charges are real, i.e., measurable charges and should not be confused with the fictitious formal charges (see oxidation numbers)!

#### Electron Pair Repulsion Model

- Definition: Model for deriving the spatial structure of a molecule, i.e., its molecular geometry, based on the repulsion between electron pairs (regardless of whether they are lone or bonding electron pairs)
- Rule: All valence electron pairs of a molecule arrange themselves in such a way that their distance is maximized.
    - The smaller the atom to which the electrons are attached, the greater the steric and electronic repulsion forces.
    - The greater the electron density at a location, the greater the space requirement.
        - Double bonds > Single bonds
        - Lone electron pairs > Bonding electron pairs → Lone electron pairs push bonds closer together
        - Lone electron pairs > Unpaired (i.e., radical) electrons
    - The greater the electronegativity difference between two bonding partners, the shorter the bond length.

##### Molecular Geometries According to the Electron Pair Repulsion Model

From the above-formulated rules, the following important geometries for molecules consisting of a central atom (Z), a bonding partner (L), and possibly lone electron pairs (E) can be derived.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Valence electrons pairs|Geometry with maximum distance|Polyhedron|Bonding situation|Example|Resulting molecular geometry|
|1; 2|linear||ZL|H2|linear (180°)|
|ZL2|CO2|
|ZLE|CO|
|3|trigonal-planar||ZL3|BF3|trigonal-planar (≈120°)|
|ZL2E|O3|angled (≈115°)|
|4|tetrahedral||ZL4|CH4|tetrahedral (≈109°)|
|ZL3E|NH3|trigonal-pyramidal (≈107°)|
|ZL2E2|H2O|bent (≈104°)|
|5|trigonal-Bipyramidal||ZL5|PF5|trigonal-bipyramidal (90° and 120°)|
|6|octahedral||ZL6|SF6|octahedral (90° and 109°)|

#### Formation of Covalent Bonds According to Valence Bond Theory

- Formation of molecular orbitals: Through the overlap of valence atomic orbitals of two bonding partners.
    - σ-bond
        - They arise from the overlap of s-s, s-p, and p-p orbitals that point directly at each other.
        - The highest electron density is exactly between the two atomic nuclei.
        - Bonding is strong
    - π-bond
        - p-p orbitals can also overlap 'sideways'
        - Highest electron density above and below the bonding plane between the atomic nuclei
        - Bonding is weak.
- Energy levels: When combining two atomic orbitals into a molecular orbital, the total number of orbitals and the energy centroid of all orbitals remain the same (law of conservation of energy)
- Electron distribution: Each electron from the respective bonding partner occupies the bonding molecular orbital, thus creating the bond between the partners.

If two fully occupied atomic orbitals were to overlap, then all four electrons would have to be accommodated in the resulting molecular orbitals. Therefore, the energetically unfavorable antibonding molecular orbital would also be occupied. Because this is energetically so unfavorable, paired valence electrons generally do not participate in bonding; these are also referred to as lone pairs of electrons!

By mixing the atomic orbitals of the bonding partners, hybrid orbitals are formed, known as molecular orbitals. These contain one electron from each bonding partner. The resulting hybrid orbitals try to stay as far apart as possible in space, which leads to the usual molecular geometries for single and multiple bonds:

|Bond Type|Hybridization|Orbital is formed from|Appearance of the Orbital|Molecular Geometry|Example Molecule|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1-fold bonding|- sp3 hybridization|- 1 σ-bond, contains 2 electrons||- Tetrahedral (i.e., there is a bond angle of about 109°)|- CH4 (methane)|
|Double bond|- sp2 hybridization|- 1 σ bond and 1 π bond; contains 4 electrons||- Trigonal planar (i.e., there is a bond angle of about 120°)|- C2H4 (ethene)<br>- Aromatics such as benzene|
|3-fold bond, cumulative double bond|- sp-hybridization|- 1 σ-bond and 2 π-bonds; contains 6 electrons||- Linear (i.e. there is a bond angle of 180°)<br>- Linear when an atom forms two double bonds, such as in CO2|- C2H2 (Ethyne)<br>- CO2|

The number of bonds that an atom forms is referred to as the "valence" of the atom!

#### Representation of Molecules

For the representation of covalent bonds, there is a simple formalism known as Lewis structures.

- Development of a Lewis structure formula
    1. Write down element symbols as they are linked together.
    2. Plot all existing valence electrons as points.
    3. When two electrons form a bond, they are connected with a solid line. If two atoms are linked by more than two electrons, a separate line is drawn for each bonding electron pair.
    4. For estimating the geometry of a molecule, see the electron pair repulsion model.
    5. Draw free electron pairs with a solid line.
        - If a molecule has an odd number of electrons remaining, then one of the electrons remains unpaired (it is still written as a dot), and the molecule is then a radical.
    6. If an atom has more or fewer bonds in a molecule than it normally needs to achieve the noble gas configuration, then positive or negative charges are written on the corresponding atoms.

> [!note]
> If the bonding of atoms in a molecule is not unambiguous, it can be represented by different Lewis structure formulas. This effect is called mesomerism or resonance!

> [!note]
> Some molecules contain unpaired electrons (which are represented as simple dots attached to the respective atom), these molecules are called radicals. Because of the unpaired electrons, they are very reactive! An example from medicine is the NO radical.

#### Special Case Complex Binding

Unlike in a normal covalent bond, where each bonding partner contributes one electron to the bond, in a complex bond (also called a coordinate bond), both electrons in the bond come from only one bonding partner.

- Definition: Covalent bond, in which one partner contributes both bonding electrons and the other provides the bonding orbitals.
- Product: Complex = Molecule that also contains coordinate bonds
- Structure: Consists of a central atom that can accept electrons and ligands with lone electron pairs.
    - Central atom: Metal atom or ion with free orbitals that can accept electrons (mostly transition metals)
        - Charge: Positive or neutral
        - Coordination number: Number of coordinate bonds between the central atom and ligands
        - Coordination polyhedron: Spatial structure of the ligands around the central atom
    - Ligands: Organic molecules or ions with free electron pairs
        - Charge: Anions (e.g., Cl-), cations (e.g., NO+) or neutral molecules with lone electron pairs (e.g., NH3)
        - Denticity: Number of binding sites that a ligand possesses (e.g. Cl- = 1-dentate; Ethylenediamine = 2-dentate)
            - Chelating ligands: Ligands that bind to a central atom with at least two atoms, like a 'crab claw' (from Greek “chelé”)
        - Combinations: Multiple ligands of the same type or different ligands can bind simultaneously.
- Binding properties
    - Education: Electrons of the ligand are shifted into orbitals of the central atom.
    - Properties
        - Spatially strongly directed
        - No large spatial structures, like those found in salts or metals, are formed; instead, "discrete" molecules are created, meaning small particles composed of several connected atoms, known as molecules.
        - Bond strength varies depending on the central atom and ligands.
        - Charge: The total charge is the sum of the charges of the central atom and the ligands; positive, negative, or neutral is possible.
        - Color
            - Main group metals: Generally colorless
            - Transition metals: Generally strongly colored
    - Nomenclature
        1. Always specify the cation first, then the anion in ionic complexes.
        2. Is the entire complex
            - Anionic, it gets the ending -ate
            - Cationic, it does not receive an ending.
            - Neutral, it receives no ending.
        3. The name of the central particle is written at the back.
        4. The charge of the central particle (oxidation state) is indicated as a Roman numeral in parentheses following it.
        5. List all ligand names in alphabetical order beforehand.
        6. Indicate the number of ligands of the same type with Greek prefixes (mono-, di-, tri, ...)
        7. Ligand names receive a suffix depending on the charge of the ligand:
            - Anionic: Ending -o
            - Cationic: no ending
            - Neutral: no ending
            - Radical: Suffix -yl
        8. Examples: Hexacyanidoferrate(II), Hexaaquairon(III), Diammine dichloroplatinate(II)

| Coordination Number | Coordination Polyhedron |     |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --- |
| 2                 | Linear                |     |
| 3                 | Trigonal              |     |
| 4                 | Tetrahedral          |     |
| 4                 | Square-planar        |     |

| 5                 | Trigonal-bipyramidal  |     |
| 6                 | Octahedral           |     |

> [!note] Complex compounds
> There are complexes (e.g., iron-sulfur clusters) in the active centers of some enzymes, complexes are involved in substance transport (e.g., in the heme group) or they are administered as medications (e.g., cisplatin as a chemotherapy drug).

> [!note] Cisplatin
> This diamminedichloroplatinum(II) complex is a cytostatic drug. The primary mode of action of the complex is based on its ability to cleave the two chlorido ligands and bind to the free binding sites in the major groove of a DNA strand (preferably at the N7 atoms of guanine and adenine). This leads to cross-linking within a DNA strand and between DNA strands, resulting in the loss of DNA functionality, halting of cellular metabolism, and initiation of apoptosis. In addition to cisplatin, which has quite a few side effects, there are other cytostatics that are similarly structured and function similarly, but whose side effects are less pronounced (e.g., spiroplatin and carboplatin).

> [!note]
> The term "complex" is not always used in the same way in chemistry, biology, and medicine! While in chemistry a compound as described above is referred to as a complex, in biology and medicine, other particles that are connected through weak interactions are also referred to as complexes, e.g., several proteins that form a "protein complex"; chemically, however, this is more aligned with weak interactions (see below)!

### Metallic Bonding

The bonding of two atoms with metallic character to each other is called a metallic bond. It has some peculiarities:

- Binding force: Freely movable valence electrons form a so-called electron gas
- Binding properties
    - Spatially undirected
    - Large spatial structures are being formed.
- Product: Metals and Alloys
    - Are easily deformable
    - Conduct electricity well

> [!note]
> The valence electrons are delocalized in metallic bonding and exist as a so-called electron gas!

### Van der Waals Forces

Often, only weak interactions exist between multiple partners or within different parts of a molecule. If the interactions are due to dipole forces, they are referred to as "Van der Waals bonds."

- Dipole: Molecules or molecular ions whose positive and negative partial charges are localized at different points in the molecule.
    - Property: Dipoles behave like small magnets
    - Origin
        - Electrons are attracted to the more electronegative bonding partner → Partially negative charge
        - Electrons are pulled away from the less electronegative bonding partner → Partially positive charge
    - Dipole moment: Measure of the polarity of a particle or the strength of charge separation in a particle
- Dipole interactions
    - Binding force: Electrostatic interactions between partially charged particles
    - Binding properties
        - Less directed than in a covalent bond, more than in an ionic bond
        - Images generally form larger spatial structures.
        - Very weak interactions
    - Products
        - Aggregate (e.g. quaternary structure of proteins)
        - Spatial structure (e.g. secondary and tertiary structure of proteins)

#### Hydrogen Bonds

A hydrogen bond results from weak electrostatic interactions between polarized molecules. Particularly for water and aqueous solutions, hydrogen bonds have special significance as they lead to the formation of a three-dimensional network.

- Binding force: Electrostatic interactions between molecules with H atoms, which are connected through highly polarized bonds to very electronegative bonding partners.
- Binding properties
    - Partner: Partially positively charged hydrogen atom and partially negatively charged heteroatom (O, N, S, halogens, ...)
    - Form
        - Binding is usually linear, very rarely slightly angled.
        - Asymmetric; the H atom is closer to the atom to which it is covalently bonded than to the atom with which it forms a hydrogen bond.
    - Consequence: Strong spatial order of the molecules of a substance due to hydrogen bonds.

##### Example Water

The water molecule exhibits some macroscopic properties solely due to weak interactions at the molecular level. Here, the key aspects of water are summarized:

- Water molecules (H2O)
    - Bivalency: Oxygen is bivalent: H-O-H
    - Geometry: Molecule is bent (bond angle = 104°)
- Density anomaly of water: Liquid water has the greatest density at around 4°C; therefore, ice floats on top of the water.
- Water as a solvent: Water dissolves everything that is also made up of polar or charged particles.
- Hydrophobic interactions
    - Water molecules repel completely nonpolar molecules; this repellent effect is called hydrophobia.
        - To keep the contact area with water molecules as small as possible, hydrophobic particles aggregate together.
- Hydration: Charged particles that are dissolved in water are surrounded by water molecules in such a way that the oppositely polarized atoms of the water molecule form a shell around the particle. This is an ion/dipole interaction.

> [!note] Hydrogen bonds
> Hydrogen bonds are present in many biomolecules and are therefore very important. In addition to the formation and stabilization of proteins, the formation of the DNA double helix should also be mentioned. Furthermore, since all cells exist in an aqueous environment, the properties of water and its solutions also play a role.

## Substances and Mixtures

### Mixture

Elements and their compounds often do not occur in separate form (i.e., as pure substances), but as mixtures of several components. This includes not only substances that are (unintentionally) contaminated, but also mixtures that are specially produced because of their unique properties (e.g., emulsions in creams, solutions of electrolytes or medications, gas mixtures and aerosols for anesthesia, including nitrous oxide mixtures).

- Heterogeneous: mixture in which the components can be distinguished by the naked eye
    - Mixture: Combination of solids (e.g., sand and shells)
    - Suspension: Mixture of liquid and solid (e.g., sand and water)
    - Foam: Mixture of liquid and gas (e.g., foam on the bathtub, which consists of air and water)
    - Emulsion: mixture of liquids (e.g., water and oil)
    - Aerosol
        - Smoke: a mixture of gas and solid (e.g., the smoke from a fire, it consists of fine carbon particles and air)
        - Fog: Mixture of gas and liquid (e.g. the weather phenomenon "fog", this fog consists of water and air)
- Homogeneous: a mixture in which the individual components can no longer be distinguished by the naked eye.
    - Alloy: Mixture of solids (e.g. brass is an alloy made from the metals copper and zinc)
    - Solution: Mixture of liquid with solid, liquid, or gas (e.g., water and salt)
    - Gas mixture: Mixture of gases (e.g. the Earth's atmosphere mainly consists of a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon)

### Separation of Mixtures

Various methods have been developed for the separation of heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures. The most important ones will be described here:

|Separation Process|Involved Substances|Method|Application Examples|
|---|---|---|---|
|Distillation|Solutions|- A mixture is heated until the liquid with the lowest boiling point evaporates<br>- What remains is a solid or a liquid with a higher boiling point<br>- The evaporated liquid can be recovered by cooling (condensation)|- Distillation of water to produce deionized water<br>- Distillery|
|Extraction|Mixtures of solid, liquid, or gaseous individual substances|- An extraction solvent is a liquid (rarely a gas or a solid) used to dissolve the component to be extracted from the mixture<br>- The extraction solvent must then be separated from the desired substance, e.g., by distillation (see above)|- Obtaining essential oils from plant parts|
|Filtration|Suspensions and aerosols|- A suspension or an aerosol is passed through a filter with an appropriate pore size<br>- Solid material remains in the filter, while the liquid or gas flows through|- Household water filtration systems|
|Chromatography|Different Substance Mixtures|- A liquid or gas flows (= mobile phase) through a stationary solid (= stationary phase)<br>- The components to be separated are carried away at different speeds by the mobile phase and thus separated<br>- Various substance properties can be utilized for the separation:<br>    - Charge<br>    - Particle size<br>    - Solubility|- In organic chemistry, e.g. as thin-layer chromatography|
|Electrophoresis|Charged particles from a mixture|- The mixture to be separated is applied to a gel, which is then placed in an electric field. Charged particles migrate at different speeds through this field<br>    - Besides the charge, the size of the particles also plays a role in the speed:|- In biochemistry and biology, among other things in paternity testing|

## Review Questions on the Chapter Structure of Matter
### Atoms and Chemical Elements

How is an atom structured?
- An atom consists of a nucleus and a shell. The nucleus is made up of the so-called nucleons, which include the positively charged protons and the uncharged neutrons. The "shell" refers to the entire space surrounding the atomic nucleus in which the negatively charged electrons are most likely to be found.

What is meant by the electron configuration of an atom? Explain the nomenclature used to specify the electron configuration.
- The negatively charged electrons of an atom are located in the atomic shell, where they repel each other. To be exposed to as little interaction as possible, the electrons occupy different regions in which they are most likely to be found, called orbitals. The distribution of the electrons of an atom across these different orbitals is called the electron configuration. A few basic rules derived from quantum mechanics apply when determining the electron configuration: An orbital can never contain more than two electrons. The orbitals are filled in the order that achieves a minimum energy state for the electrons. When specifying the electron configuration of an atom, a nomenclature is used in which the considered orbitals are first indicated: A number indicates how far the orbital is from the nucleus (this can be pictured as the different shells of the Bohr atomic model), and a letter describes the shape of the orbital (s-orbitals are spherical, p-orbitals are dumbbell-shaped, d-orbitals are crossed double dumbbells). The number and letter for the orbital are followed by a superscript number that indicates how many electrons are present in these orbitals. The orbitals are sorted according to their respective energy levels. This leads, for example, to the 3d orbitals being filled only after the 4s orbitals!

Which elemental property is measured in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and which element is typically detected during an MRI examination?
- As the name suggests, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging examines the so-called (nuclear) spin, a rotational movement around the axis of the atomic nucleus. This occurs when an atom has an odd number of protons in its nucleus, because then it behaves like a small magnet. Since the MRI examination requires the strongest possible signal, the most common element with nuclear spin in the human body is usually examined – hydrogen (H).

What does the atomic mass consist of and in what unit is it expressed?
- Since electrons have a negligibly small mass, the mass of an atom is determined by the components of its nucleus. Protons and neutrons each have a mass of one "u" (= unit). Since 1 u is defined as 1/12 of the mass of a carbon atom, the so-determined atomic mass is called the relative atomic mass.

For which elements do the following symbols stand: H, O, N, P, C, Ag, Na, K, Ca, and Mg?
- The element symbols stand for the following elements: H = Hydrogen, O = Oxygen, N = Nitrogen, P = Phosphorus, C = Carbon, Ag = Silver, Na = Sodium, K = Potassium, Ca = Calcium, and Mg = Magnesium.

What are isotopes? Explain their structure using the usual terminology.
- Isotopes are types of atoms (i.e., nuclides) of an element that have the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. To describe isotopes, a nuclide notation is used in which, in addition to the element symbol, the nucleon number is added at the upper left and the proton number at the lower left.

What happens when an atom has an excess of protons?
- If an isotope’s atomic nucleus contains more protons than neutrons, the atomic nucleus has a strong positive charge that is not well shielded. As a result, the isotope is unstable and tends to reduce the proton excess by transforming protons into neutrons. The radiation produced in this process is called β+ radiation.

Why is the atomic mass indicated in the periodic table of elements (PSE) not identical to the relative atomic mass?
- The atomic mass indicated in the periodic table of elements takes into account which isotopes occur naturally in what proportion and forms a corresponding average value. Therefore, this value is not exactly identical to the relative atomic mass of the most common isotope.

What ions make up the salt sodium nitrate (NaNO3)?
- Sodium nitrate consists of the singly positively charged cation Na+ and the singly negatively charged anion NO3-.

### Periodic Table of Elements

Explain the ordering principle of the elements in the periodic table.
- The periodic table of elements is built based on several ordering principles: 1) The elements are sorted according to increasing proton number in the nucleus; this is therefore also called the "atomic number." 2) In each row of the periodic table, a different shell of the atomic shell is filled with electrons, in the first row the first shell (= K-shell), in the second the second (= L-shell), in the third the third (= M-shell), and so on. 3) In each column of the periodic table, a different orbital type in the respective shell is filled, in the first two groups the s-orbitals, in the so-called transition groups (groups 3–12) the d-orbitals, and in groups 13–18 the p-orbitals.

How many valence electrons do the elements of the eight main groups have, respectively?
- The number of the main group corresponds to the number of valence electrons of the elements in that group. In the first main group, the elements have one valence electron, in the eighth main group eight valence electrons.

Derives from the number of its valence electrons how many bonds the element phosphorus (Group 5 = Group 15) prefers to form.
- The element phosphorus has five valence electrons and can thus form a maximum of five bonds. Since two of the five valence electrons can also exist as an electron pair, phosphorus often forms only three bonds.

What are the noble gases and where does the name come from?
- Noble gases are the elements of the 8th main group (= group 18) in the periodic table of elements. These include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). The name "noble gases" was given to these gaseous elements because they virtually do not react with other substances (i.e., they are inert). This is because the elements have a closed (i.e., completely filled) shell with their eight valence electrons on the outermost shell. To react further, either an electron must be removed from the complete shell (forming a cation) or an electron must be added to an until-then unoccupied shell (forming an anion). Both are energetically very unfavorable and therefore only occur under drastic reaction conditions.

Which trend does the ionic radius follow in the periodic table of elements?
- The size of an ion (indicated by the ionic radius) increases within a group from top to bottom and decreases within a row from left to right.

What trend does electronegativity follow in the periodic table of elements?
- Electronegativity is the ability of an atom to attract electrons to its nucleus. Therefore, the electronegativity of elements decreases within a column from top to bottom and increases within a row from left to right.

Which element constitutes the largest mass proportion in the human body?
- The most common element in the human body is hydrogen (H) with about 63 atomic percent. However, since hydrogen is such a light element, it only accounts for the third largest mass proportion (about 10%). The element with the largest mass proportion in the human body (about 61%) is oxygen (O), followed by carbon (C) with a mass proportion of about 23%.

### Chemical Bonds

How do lone electron pairs influence the bonding geometry in a molecule and what is this model called?
- Due to their negative charge density, electrons in a molecule take the greatest possible distance from each other. This influences the spatial structure of molecules, i.e., their bonding geometry. The so-called electron pair repulsion model uses this effect to predict which bonding geometry should be energetically most favorable for molecules with a certain number of bonds. Lone electron pairs distort the geometry of the bodies because they also have a negative charge density. This is even estimated to be somewhat greater than that of bonding electrons, because there is no second bonding partner shielding the negative charge density. The water molecule (H2O) with its two bonds is therefore not linear but bent (104°) because of the two lone electron pairs on the oxygen atom. And the ammonia molecule (NH3) is also not trigonal planar but trigonal pyramidal (107°).

What is meant by sp2 hybridization?
- Hybridization refers to the "mixing" of orbitals when molecular orbitals form from atomic orbitals in a covalent bond. If a double bond forms in the molecule, two p orbitals and one s orbital mix to form sp2 hybridization. This results in a bond where half of the electron density is localized exactly on the bonding axis between the two atoms (so-called σ-bond) and the other half is located above and below the bonding axis between the atoms (π-bond).

What is meant by the term "complex" in chemistry?
- In chemistry, the term "complex" refers to a molecule whose central particle is a metal atom or ion and to which ligands (atoms, organic molecules, or ions) bind. In the complex bond, both electrons come from the ligand, but the orbital into which these are pushed comes from the central particle. The coordinate bonds in the complex are therefore basically normal covalent bonds, but with the difference that in a normal covalent molecular bond, the electrons and orbitals are contributed by both bonding partners.

What is special about so-called chelate complexes?
- Chelate complexes contain ligands that form more than one bond to the central particle. Since this bonding motif resembles a crab’s claw, the term "chelate" (from Greek chele = "crab’s claw") is used. The special thing about these complexes is that the chelate ligands bind more firmly to the central particle than simply bonded ligands. If one of the ligand’s bonds to the central particle breaks, the other bonds still keep it close to the central particle, making it more likely that the bond re-forms.

Explain what a hydrogen bond is and provide examples of why it plays such an important role in biochemistry.
- A hydrogen bond is a weak intermolecular interaction between a hydrogen donor (molecule with a positively polarized H atom) and a hydrogen acceptor (negatively polarized heteroatom, e.g., oxygen or nitrogen). The interaction between the molecules is therefore based solely on electrostatic attraction and involves only little energy. Nevertheless, hydrogen bonds are very important in biological systems. They cause the density anomaly of water, influence the solvation of molecules, as well as the spatial structure and reactivity of proteins.

What is hydrophobia and how does it occur?
- Hydrophobia refers to the effect that nonpolar molecules are repelled by polar water molecules. This repulsive interaction belongs to the so-called weak interactions – so it does not require much energy to overcome the repulsive forces. Nevertheless, hydrophobic particles aggregate into spherical clusters in water to minimize their contact surface with water molecules.
