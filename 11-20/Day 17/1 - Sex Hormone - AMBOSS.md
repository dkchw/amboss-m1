### Overview of Sex Hormones and Central Regulation

Through which feedback loop is the release of sexual hormones regulated? Name the involved hormones!
- The release of sexual hormones is centrally controlled via the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The pulsatile, hypothalamic secretion of the releasing hormone GnRH causes the release of the gonadotropins LH and FSH from the adenohypophysis. LH and FSH stimulate the release of sexual hormones in the ovaries or testes.
What effect does Luteinizing Hormone (LH) have on its target cells?
- Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates the Leydig cells of the testis or the theca cells of the ovaries. In men, this causes an increase primarily in testosterone biosynthesis; in women, a steep rise in its concentration in the middle of the cycle induces ovulation and subsequently the formation of the corpus luteum.
What stimulates the release of inhibin and what effect does it have on the regulatory circuit of sex hormones?
- Inhibin is synthesized in the ovaries (granulosa cells) or in the testes (Sertoli cells) and its release is stimulated by FSH. In terms of negative feedback, it inhibits FSH secretion in the pituitary gland.
### Androgen

What is the starting substance of all sex steroids? Describe the first step of testosterone biosynthesis!
- The synthesis of sex steroids always begins with cholesterol. In the first step of testosterone biosynthesis, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone, from which testosterone is then produced via two different pathways involving the formation of several already active prohormones.
What reaction is catalyzed by aromatase? Name the number of carbon atoms in the starting and end product!
- Estrogens are steroid hormones with 18 carbon atoms and are formed from androgens with the help of aromatase. During this process, the C19 methyl group of the androgen is removed and a characteristic aromatic ring is formed at the A-ring of the steroid backbone (aromatization).
Describe the effects of testosterone on metabolism! What CNS effect of the hormone has been proven in animals but is still being discussed in humans?
- The luteal phase is designated as the second half of the menstrual cycle, beginning with ovulation. The leading hormone of this phase is the gestagen progesterone produced by the corpus luteum, under whose influence the basal core body temperature rises by about 0.5 °C (the so-called "thermogenic effect").
### Estrogens and Progestogens

What effect do estrogens have on bone tissue?
- Estrogens activate osteoblasts and thereby promote bone formation. Estrogen deficiency (e.g., after menopause) correspondingly favors bone resorption.
How are estrogens structured? What characteristic biochemical property do they possess?
- Estrogens are steroid hormones with 18 carbon atoms and are formed from androgens with the help of aromatase. During this process, the C19 methyl group of the androgen is removed and a characteristic aromatic ring is formed at the A-ring of the steroid backbone (aromatization).
What changes in body temperature can be observed during the so-called "luteal phase" of the menstrual cycle, and which hormone causes them?
- The luteal phase is designated as the second half of the menstrual cycle, beginning with ovulation. The leading hormone of this phase is the gestagen progesterone produced by the corpus luteum, under whose influence the basal core body temperature rises by about 0.5 °C (the so-called "thermogenic effect").
### Menstrual Cycle

At what point or in which phase of the menstrual cycle does the so-called LH peak occur? What triggers it and what effect does it have?
- LH reaches its highest concentration at mid-cycle (around day 14) during the late follicular phase. Its sudden rise is triggered by estrogen production of the growing ovarian follicles (10–20 follicles per cycle) and in turn induces ovulation.
Describe the changes in the endometrium of the non-pregnant uterus during the so-called "secretory phase" of the menstrual cycle! Which hormone dominates?
- The secretory phase of the menstrual cycle begins with ovulation. Under the influence of the hormone progesterone, whose concentration initially rises sharply in this phase, the uterine lining differentiates in preparation for the possible implantation of a fertilized egg. By taking up nutrients (glycogen, proteins, lipids), the stromal cells of the endometrium visibly swell histologically and are called predecidual cells due to their similarity to the decidual cells of the placenta. If pregnancy does not occur, the progesterone level drops. The withdrawal of the hormone triggers vasospasms in the spiral arteries of the endometrium, resulting in ischemic necrosis and shedding of the functional layer. This so-called "desquamation phase" initiates menstruation and a new cycle begins.
What prevents the coagulation of menstrual blood in the uterus?
- Coagulation of menstrual blood is prevented by increased local fibrinolysis through the enzyme plasmin contained in the uterine lining.
