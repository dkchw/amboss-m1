# Bacteria
## Summary

Bacteria are small, single-celled organisms that are primarily distinguished from the cells of animal or plant life by the absence of a nucleus. Therefore, they are collectively referred to as prokaryotes (from Greek pro = "before," "instead of," and karyon = "nut"). Bacteria are, on one hand, part of the healthy and necessary colonization of humans, but they can also trigger a variety of infectious diseases. This will provide an overview of the classification of bacteria, their morphological characteristics, and their genetics.

## Morphological Basic Forms of Bacteria

- Classification by shape (excerpt)
    - Rods: For example, Escherichia coli
    - Cook: Round bacteria
        - Arrangement of the cocci
            - Streptococci: Chain-shaped, such as Streptococcus pyogenes
            - Staphylococci: Cluster-shaped, such as Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of purulent abscesses)
            - Diplococci: In pairs, such as Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae
    - Spirochetes: Spiral-shaped, flexible, such as Treponema pallidum (the causative agent of syphilis) and Borrelia burgdorferi (the causative agent of Lyme disease)
    - Vibrios: Comma-shaped, such as Vibrio cholerae (the causative agent of cholera)
- Classification by dyeing behavior
    - Gram-positive
    - Gram-negative
    - Atypical Gram behavior

> [!note] Urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli
> E. coli are gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria and are part of the normal intestinal flora. However, due to anatomical conditions, they can easily move from the intestines to the urinary tract, especially in women, and cause an infection there. A urinary tract infection is characterized by pain and burning during urination. In microbiological diagnostics, the gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria appear red under the microscope.

## Characteristics of Prokaryotic Cells

The morphology of the prokaryotic cell has some particularities, which are outlined below. Further information about the individual cell compartments can be found under: "The Cell". There, you will also find the comparison of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.

### Intracellular Components and Cell Membrane

- Nucleoid
    - Genome of the prokaryotic cell
    - Circular, double helical DNA molecule
    - No nuclear envelope
    - Is located in the cytoplasm
- Plasmid: Small DNA rings that can code for important traits and pathogenicity factors in addition to the nucleoid and can replicate autonomously.
- Ribosomes
    - Sedimentation coefficient: 70S
    - 30S and 50S subunit
    - Starting point for numerous antibiotics, e.g. tetracyclines and macrolides (see below)
- Cell membrane
    - Phospholipid bilayer between cytoplasm and cell wall
    - Electron transport chain and DNA replication localized on the inner side of the membrane → Higher protein content than in eukaryotic cells
    - Contains penicillin-binding protein: enzyme involved in the synthesis of murein

> [!note]
> Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus - the circular DNA is located in the cytoplasm and is called the nucleoid!

> [!note]
> Prokaryotic cells do not contain mitochondria. The respiratory chain is located at the cell membrane of the bacterial cell!

> [!note]
> Prokaryotic cells possess 70S ribosomes with a 30S and a 50S subunit!

> [!note] Macrolide
> Macrolide antibiotics bind to the 50S subunit of the ribosomes and thus inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, which hinders the growth of bacteria. Therapeutic applications of macrolides include infections with streptococci, but also with intracellular pathogens such as chlamydia.

> [!note] Tetracycline
> The antibiotics of the tetracycline class bind to the 30S subunit of prokaryotic ribosomes. They prevent cell growth by inhibiting translation (protein biosynthesis). The spectrum of pathogens includes, for example, Neisseria.

> [!note] Chloramphenicol
> The antibiotic chloramphenicol binds to the large subunit of bacterial ribosomes (50S subunit) and inhibits its peptidyl transferase activity. The bacterial metabolism is therefore inhibited at the level of translation.

### Special Features of the Bacterial Cell Wall

With few exceptions (e.g., mycoplasmas), most bacteria have a cell wall: This surrounds the cell membrane and additionally stabilizes the bacterium. The cell wall provides a target for various antibiotics.

- Function
    - Form and stabilization of the bacterium
    - Anchoring of pili and flagella
    - Protection against chemical noxious substances and bursting
- Structure: Layers of varying thickness made of peptidoglycan, known as "peptidoglycan sacculus" → Varying stainability in Gram staining
- Dyeability
    - Gram-positive bacteria: Thick peptidoglycan layers are stained more intensely in the Gram stain → Blue-violet appearance under the microscope
        - Teichuronic acids: Glycopolymers anchored in the cell wall
        - For example, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus
    - Gram-negative bacteria: Single-layered peptidoglycan sacculus → Red representation after Gram staining
        - Phospholipid membrane: It is anchored to the monolayer peptidoglycan sacculus via lipoproteins and contains lipopolysaccharides.
        - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
            - They are located on the surface of the phospholipid membrane and point outward.
            - Sol. Endotoxins: Release during the death of the bacterial cell triggers a toxic reaction in the host.
        - For example, E. coli
- Special Features
    - Wall-less bacteria: e.g. Mycoplasmas
    - Atypical cell wall
        - Mycobacteria: Special cell wall structure made of wax and lipids → Nutrients enter the interior of the bacteria only with difficulty due to the cell wall structure → Slow growth and reproduction
- Clinical relevance: Cell wall synthesis target for penicillin (see below)

> [!note] Gram staining
> The Gram staining was developed in 1884 by the Danish pathologist Christian Gram and takes advantage of the different peptidoglycan concentrations of bacterial cell walls. The first staining occurs in two steps with crystal violet and iodine solution, followed by a wash with alcohol. In bacteria with a thick peptidoglycan layer, the dye cannot be washed out by the alcohol, so they appear blue under the microscope (= "gram-positive"). In bacteria with a thin peptidoglycan layer, the dye is washed out, resulting in complete decolorization. To subsequently visualize the gram-negative bacteria, the preparation is stained with fuchsin in an additional step. Gram-positive bacteria retain the blue color from the first steps, while the gram-negative bacteria now appear red.


> [!note]
> Gram-negative bacterial cells are structured from the inside out as follows: 1. Inner cell membrane 2. Single-layered peptidoglycan sacculus 3. Outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides!

> [!note]
> The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria contains lipopolysaccharides. These so-called endotoxins, which are produced when the bacterium dies, are among the triggers of severe systemic inflammatory reactions (sepsis). Endotoxins are characteristic of gram-negative bacteria!

> [!note] Penicillin
> β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin primarily act against gram-positive pathogens that have cell walls composed of thick layers of peptidoglycan. Penicillin exerts its bactericidal effect by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme transpeptidase, preventing the cross-linking of the peptidoglycan subunits.

## Pathogenic Factors (Virulence Factors)

Pathogenic factors (virulence factors) give a bacterium its infectiousness and thus contribute to the development of diseases. However, many of the pathogenic factors mentioned here occur only in certain bacteria - for example, most bacteria do not have a capsule, whereas pneumococci do.

- Capsule
    - Structure: Mucus capsule made of polysaccharides and polypeptides
    - Function
        - Prevention of phagocytosis
        - Improved adhesion to substrates
        - Nutrient reserve
    - Typical representative: Pneumococci (gram-positive encapsulated diplococci)
- Flagella (flagella)
    - Function: Rotation of the flagella → Directed movement of the bacterium
    - Structure: Screw shape made of long chains of flagellin
    - Number: Cell with one (Monotrich) or more flagella (Polytrich)
    - Arrangement to Cell
        - Monopolar: At one cell end
        - Bipolar: At both cell ends
        - Peritrich: Distributed on the surface
- Pili (Fimbriate)
    - Function: Adherence = The sticking of bacteria to each other or to host cells
    - Structure: Similar to flagella, but much smaller (especially gram-negative bacteria, e.g. the most important pathogenic factor of uropathogenic E. coli)
        - Special form Sexpili: Protein tubes for contacting other bacteria → Enabling gene exchange
- Spores
    - Structure: Shell made of spore wall, -bark and -coat
    - Function: Long-term forms of bacteria that are formed under unfavorable external conditions → Survival of external states
    - Properties: Resistant to heating or chemical noxious substances (e.g., disinfectants!)
    - Education: Breakdown of the cytoplasm to a small residue, which contains DNA, RNA, ribosomes, and enzymes → Restricted metabolism until conditions improve.
    - Typical representatives: Gram-positive rod bacteria such as Clostridia or Bacillus anthracis
- Endotoxin (s.o.)

> [!note] Spore formation
> Spores of various dangerous bacteria can survive for decades, during which they tolerate temperatures exceeding 100°C and are also resistant to many disinfectants. Well-known spore formers include, for example, Clostridium tetani (the causative agent of tetanus), Clostridium perfringens (the most common cause of gas gangrene), or Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax).

> [!note] Pathogenic factors of pneumococci
> Pneumococci (Streptococcus pneumoniae), which cause, among other things, pneumonia and meningitis, obtain their pathogenicity partly through their capsule, which protects them from phagocytosis by macrophages. Under the microscope, they appear as gram-positive cocci arranged in pairs. The spleen, as a lymphatic organ, plays a special role in defending against encapsulated bacteria. If it needs to be removed (e.g., after an injury), those affected must receive vaccinations against pneumococci prophylactically due to increased susceptibility to infections!

## Growth and Reproduction of Bacteria

The bacteria can be distinguished by their need for oxygen: Some can only multiply in the presence of oxygen, while others can only multiply in its absence. This can be of great relevance in clinical practice, for example in the case of an infection with anaerobes. In this case, a wound must be treated openly to prevent the growth of the bacteria.

### Classification by Oxygen Reference and Intracellular Growth

- Obligate aerobes: Oxygen is required for energy production from the respiratory chain.
    - Typical representative: Legionella pneumophila
- Obligate anaerobe: Energy production exclusively through anaerobic glycolysis (fermentation); oxygen is toxic.
    - Typical representative: Clostridioides difficile
- Facultative anaerobic bacteria: Growth is possible with or without oxygen.
- Intracellular proliferation: Proliferation of some bacteria is obligately intracellular.
    - Typical representatives: Chlamydia, Rickettsia

### Bacterial Cultures

- Definition: Cultivation of bacteria in bacteriological diagnostics on various nutrient media
- Function: Microscopic identification, e.g., from smear material for examining responsiveness to antibiotics.
- Cultural media
    - Selective media: Isolation of bacteria with specific properties
    - Enrichment media: Optimal cultivation of the desired bacterium

### Growth Curve of Bacteria

- Growth curve: Describes the characteristic increase of bacterial cell concentration
    1. Lag Phase (= Initial Phase): Adaptation to the growth medium, few cell divisions
    2. Log-Phase (= Exponential Growth Phase): High growth rate, short generation time
    3. Stationary Phase
        - Slowing down of growth due to the limitation of nutrients and the increase of toxic metabolic products
        - Balance of the population
    4. Dying phase
        - Deterioration of living conditions, e.g. due to a lack of nutrients
        - Decrease of cell population

> [!note]
> Clostridia (e.g., C. difficile, C. tetani) are obligate anaerobes and spore formers!

## Bacterial Genetics and Antibiotic Resistance

The genome of a bacterium is located in its nucleoid. Gene activity is primarily regulated by controlling transcription. See also: gene expression and protein biosynthesis. Genetic information can be transferred in various ways.

### Mechanisms of Genetic Variability

- Intracellular mechanisms
    - High mutation rate
    - Homologous recombination
- Intercellular mechanisms
    - Conjugation: Transfer of plasmids between bacteria
    - Transduction (Bacteria): Distribution of genetic information through the infection of a bacterium with a bacteriophage
        - Direct production of new viruses with destruction of the bacterium (lytic phage)
        - Integration of phage DNA into the bacterial genome (prophage)
    - Transformation (Bacteria): Uptake of free DNA through the cell wall
- Transposition: Exchange of genetic information in the form of a so-called transposon ("jumping gene" with a typical structure, see below) within a genome or between the genomes of different bacteria that do not resemble each other in their gene sequence.

### Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance

Bacteria have the ability to develop resistance to antibiotics, which they can also exchange among themselves via plasmids. Since they have high mutation rates and very short generation times, bacteria are particularly adaptable. This has gained significant relevance due to the widespread use of antibiotics - a well-known example of this is the so-called "hospital germs," which can no longer be fought with common antibiotics.

- Possible resistance mechanisms with examples
    - Change in target structure: Mutation in the gyrase gene leads to resistance against fluoroquinolones, as these can no longer bind to gyrase.
    - Inactivation: Formation of a β-lactamase that cleaves the β-lactam ring (e.g., of penicillin)
    - Extrusion: Tetracyclines are actively pumped out of the cell by membrane proteins.
- Resistance types
    - Natural species or genus resistance
    - Neumutation
    - Gene transfer
        - Example: Resistance transfer by means of transposition ("cut & paste" mechanism)
            - Structure of the transposon
                - "Upstream" insertion sequence (IS element) consisting of:
                    - Inverted Repeat (IR; short, opposing sequence repeats)
                    - Genes that encode proteins important for transposition (e.g., for transposase)
                - Genes for antibiotic resistance, e.g. against vancomycin
                - "Subsequent" IS element
            - Mechanism
                - The transposase binds to the ends of the transposon (more specifically to the inverted repeats) and creates strand breaks.
                - The target DNA sequence is cut, resulting in staggered cuts with free 5' ends.
                - The excised transposon is integrated into the target DNA sequence on an R-plasmid.
                - DNA polymerase fills the gaps that arise, so that the same sequences are formed before and after the transposon.
            - Result: The transposon is now located on an R-plasmid with the resistance gene (in this example, the vancomycin resistance), which can be transferred to other bacteria.
- Emergence of multi-resistant pathogens: Administration of antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity or premature discontinuation of antibiotic therapy creates selection pressure that promotes the growth of resistant bacteria.

> [!note] MRSA
> The so-called "methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA) has lost the ability to bind to the so-called β-lactam antibiotics through modification of its penicillin-binding protein. MRSA primarily causes wound infections in hospitals among patients with risk factors. For alternative therapy, vancomycin can be used; however, infections with vancomycin-resistant MRSA (VRSA) are already occurring.


## Review Questions on the Chapter Bacteria

### Morphological Basic Forms of Bacteria

How are round bacteria referred to and how can they be arranged?
- Bacteria with a round shape are called cocci. They can be arranged in clusters (staphylococci), chains (streptococci), or pairs (diplococci).

What is the most common pathogen of urinary tract infections? Describe its shape and Gram reaction!
- The most common pathogen of urinary tract infections is Escherichia coli (E. coli) - a gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that is part of the physiological intestinal flora. It can particularly easily enter the urinary tract from the intestine in women due to anatomical proximity and cause an infection there.

Which type of pathogen is often found in purulent abscesses? Describe its shape and Gram reaction!
- Pustular abscesses are usually caused by staphylococci (especially Staph. aureus). These are gram-positive, cluster-shaped bacteria.

Describe the shape of spirochete bacteria! What disease is caused by Treponema pallidum, which belongs to the spirochetes?
- The spirochetes have a spiral, flexible shape. Among them is the pathogen of syphilis, Treponema pallidum.

### Characteristics of the Prokaryotic Cell

Where does energy production take place in the bacterial cell?
- Prokaryotes, like eukaryotes, obtain their energy through the respiratory chain. However, since they do not possess mitochondria, the protein complexes of the respiratory chain in prokaryotes are anchored on the inner side of the cell membrane.

The so-called lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are found only in gram-negative bacteria. Where exactly are they located and what happens to them when the bacterial cell breaks down?
- The lipopolysaccharides are located in the outer phospholipid membrane of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria. Upon the death of the bacterial cell, they trigger toxic reactions in the host as so-called endotoxins (e.g., activation of the coagulation cascade, vasodilation), which can, in the worst case, lead to shock.

Which cell property determines whether a bacterium can be stained as gram-positive or gram-negative?
- Gram-positive bacteria differ from gram-negative bacteria in the structure of their cell wall: Gram-positive bacteria have thick layers of peptidoglycan (so-called murein sacculus), which can be strongly stained by Gram staining and appear blue-violet under the microscope. The staining remains even after rinsing with alcohol. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria usually have only a single-layered murein sacculus, which allows the Gram stain to be completely washed out, and the bacteria (after further staining) appear red.

The mycobacteria, which include the pathogen of tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), have a unique cell wall structure. What characterizes it and what effects does this have on cellular processes?
- Mycobacteria have an atypical cell wall structure made of wax and lipids. As a result, nutrients have difficulty entering the interior of the bacteria; consequently, cell growth and reproduction can only occur very slowly.

How does penicillin exert its antibiotic effect? Against which type of bacteria is it especially effective?
- Penicillin prevents the cross-linking of the subunits of peptidoglycan and thus bacterial cell wall synthesis by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme transpeptidase. This leads to osmotic cell lysis, meaning that penicillin actively kills the bacteria (bactericidal effect). It is particularly effective against gram-positive pathogens, whose cell walls consist of thick layers of peptidoglycan.

In what common way do the antibiotic groups of macrolides and tetracyclines, as well as chloramphenicol, exert their effect?
- Macrolides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol exert their antibacterial effect by binding to prokaryotic ribosomes (at different subunits). They intervene at the level of translation (protein biosynthesis) and prevent cell growth (bacteriostatic effect).

Where is the bacterial DNA located and in what form does it exist?
- Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus, and their DNA is found freely in the cytoplasm. It exists in the form of a nucleoid (= circular, double-helical DNA molecule) and also as plasmids (= small DNA rings). In addition to the nucleoid, plasmids code for important traits (e.g., antibiotic resistances and virulence factors) and can replicate independently of it.

### Pathogenic Factors

Describe the shape and gram behavior of pneumococci (Streptococcus pneumoniae)! What is their most important pathogenic factor and what function does it have?
- Pneumococci appear under the microscope as gram-positive, paired cocci (so-called diplococci). Their most important and characteristic virulence factor is the formation of a mucous capsule made of polysaccharides and polypeptides, which prevents the phagocytosis of the bacteria by macrophages.

How do the so-called pili (= fimbriae) contribute to the infectivity of a bacterium? For which bacterium are they the most important pathogenicity factor?
- Pili or fimbriae are cell protrusions that extend from the cell wall and serve for the adhesion of bacteria to one another or to host cells (so-called adherence). They are the most important virulence factor of uropathogenic E. coli, which can use them to attach to the urogenital epithelium.

What are flagella (= flagella)?
- Flagella or flagella are filamentous cell protrusions made of flagellin, which are anchored in the cell wall. They can rotate around their own axis like a propeller, thus enabling directed movements of the bacteria.

What is the name of the very resistant dormant form of bacteria that can be produced by some bacteria under unfavorable external conditions? Which bacteria are typically involved?
- Some pathogens are capable of forming spores. These are dormant forms of bacteria that can withstand unfavorable conditions and are resistant to heat or disinfectants. Typically, they are produced by gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria such as Bacillus anthracis (the causative agent of anthrax) or various species of Clostridia.

### Growth and Reproduction of Bacteria

Name an example of a bacterium that lacks its own energy metabolism and therefore relies on the ATP of the host cell for its reproduction!
- Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria; they can only multiply within a host cell. This is because they do not possess their own energy metabolism and require the host's ATP (so-called energy parasites).

What are bacteria called that can only grow under low oxygen conditions? Name a typical representative!
- Bacteria that can only grow under low-oxygen conditions are also called obligate anaerobes. They obtain their energy through anaerobic glycolysis. Typical obligate anaerobic bacteria include clostridia (e.g., Clostridium tetani, Clostridioides difficile).

### Bacterial Genetics and Antibiotic Resistance

Through which intercellular mechanisms can a bacterium acquire additional genetic information (e.g., pathogenicity factors)?
- The transfer of genetic information to a bacterium can occur through various mechanisms. Transduction refers to the transfer of genetic information (especially virulence factors) to a bacterium through infection with a bacteriophage (a virus specialized in bacteria). Conjugation describes the exchange of plasmids between bacteria (e.g., for the transfer of resistances), while transformation refers to the uptake of free DNA through the cell wall.
