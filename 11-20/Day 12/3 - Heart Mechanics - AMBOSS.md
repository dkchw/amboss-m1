# Heart Mechanics
## Summary

The heart functions similarly to an electric water pump, performing pumping actions at a certain frequency (heart rate) and pumping a certain amount of fluid (stroke volume) into the water line (vessels). The electrical impulse that drives this process is generated autonomously in specialized pacemaker centers of the heart, such as the sinoatrial node (see also: heart excitation). The resulting action potential is coordinated and transmitted to all heart muscle cells via a specialized conduction system. The electrical impulse is translated into the physical movement of the myofilaments actin and myosin in each individual heart muscle cell through the process of electromechanical coupling, causing the heart muscle to contract.

To describe the heart action, the pumping process is divided into two phases: the "pumping phase" (systole) and the "suction phase" (diastole). The pressure and volume changes in the left ventricle during the heart action can be observed on the heart's work diagram, as well as the constant adjustments to pressure and volume fluctuations that occur in daily life. The intrinsic Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart is responsible for short-term adjustments, while medium- and long-term changes are regulated by the autonomic nervous system.
## Basic Parameters of Heart Function

The main task of the heart is to supply the body with blood. This activity can be described by measurable parameters such as heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output.

- Heart rate (HR): Number of heart contractions per unit of time (e.g., 60/min)
- Stroke volume (SV): Blood volume that is ejected by the (left or right) ventricle per contraction.
- Ejection fraction (EF): The proportion of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected from the ventricle; in healthy individuals, it should be at least 55%.
    - Calculation formula: EF = Stroke volume / End-diastolic volume
- Cardiac output (CO): Volume ejected by the ventricle per unit of time → Results from stroke volume and heart rate
    - Calculation formula: SV = Stroke volume × Heart rate
    - Determination: Usually using Fick's principle

> [!NOTE]
> The stroke volume of the heart is difficult to determine in clinical practice, so an indicator dilution method based on the so-called Fick principle can be applied!

## Phases of Cardiac Action

The heart action can be divided into two phases: on one hand, systole, in which blood is pumped out of the heart, and on the other hand, diastole, in which the heart fills with blood. Systole and diastole are each subdivided into two further phases, resulting in a total of four phases of heart action. Due to the contraction and pumping processes, pressure and volume in the heart chambers and atria change in a characteristic manner, with the pressure in the left ventricle changing the most and the pressure in the atria changing the least.

### Systole

#### 1.) Tension Phase

- Main function: ventricles contract
- Process
    1. All valves are closed and the ventricles are filled with blood.
    2. Isovolumetric contraction of the working myocardium
    3. Pressure increase in the ventricles until the pressure in the aorta or the pulmonary trunk is exceeded.
    4. Passive opening of the pouch flaps (pulmonary and aortic valve) → beginning of the ejection phase
- Status of the left ventricle
    - Pressure: Increase from about 8 mmHg to about 80 mmHg
    - Volume: Constantly about 150 mL (isovolumetric tension)

#### 2.) Eviction Phase

- Main function: Blood is pumped from the ventricles into the circulation and lungs.
- Process
    1. Blood flows from the ventricles into the pulmonary trunk or the aorta (most of it already at the beginning of the ejection phase)
    2. Further contraction of the myocardium (starting at the distal septum and the heart apex)
    3. Ventricular wall thickness ↑ and ventricular inner diameter ↓
    4. Pressure in the ventricles ↑ (Laplace's Law) → Blood volume ↓ in the ventricle (max. ventricular pressure is approximately at the peak of the T-wave in the ECG)
    5. Pressure ↓ slowly in the ventricle (until below the pressure of the aorta or pulmonary trunk)
    6. End of the pocket flaps → Beginning of the relaxation phase (approximately at the end of the T-wave in the ECG)
- Status of the left ventricle
    - Pressure: Increase from about 80 mmHg to about 120 mmHg, then decrease
    - Volume: Ejection of approximately 90 mL stroke volume (150 mL → 60 mL)

### Diastole

#### 3.) Relaxation Phase

- Main function: Ventricles relax
- Process
    1. All heart valves are closed (volume remains constant)
    2. Further relaxation of the myocardium (pressure ↓ in the ventricles)
    3. Isovolumetric relaxation
    4. Ventricular pressure falls below the pressure in the atria.
    5. The sail flaps open → Beginning of the filling phase
- Status of the left ventricle
    - Pressure: Decrease to about 10 mmHg
    - Volume: Constantly about 60 mL (isovolumetric relaxation)

#### 4.) Filling Phase

- Main function: Ventricles fill again with blood
- Process
    1. The valve plane raises and "turns over" the blood column in the atria (valve plane mechanism)
        - Ventilation levels mechanism: Contributes significantly to diastolic filling
    2. At the end of diastole, the atria contract briefly.
    3. Pressure in the ventricle exceeds the pressure in the atria.
    4. End of the flap adjustment → Start of the tensioning phase
- Status of the left ventricle
    - Pressure: approx. 8 mmHg
    - Volume: Filling with approx. 90 mL (60 mL → 150 mL)

| Expulsion phase                                                  | Further increase in pressure from about 80 mmHg to about 120 mmHg | 150 mL → about 60 mL                    |
| Relaxation phase                                                 | Decrease in pressure to about 10 mmHg                  | about 60 mL                          |
| Filling phase                                                      | Relatively constant at about 8 mmHg                    | about 60 mL → 150 mL                    |
## Working Diagram of the Heart

During a cardiac cycle and its four phases, both the pressure and volume in the left ventricle change. If you plot these cyclical changes in volume and pressure during a cardiac cycle on a coordinate system, you obtain the so-called work diagram of the heart. The area on the diagram enclosed by the graphs of the four phases of the cardiac cycle corresponds to the pressure-volume work of the heart.

### Sequence of a Heartbeat in the Heart's Work Diagram

A work diagram is clearly easier to read than to create, which is why it is often helpful to first try to understand a heart action in the work diagram and only then focus on constructing the respective curves. The exact processes of the respective phases of the heart action are described further above; here they should primarily be considered in relation to the work diagram.

#### Systole

- 1) Tension phase (see: Point 1 → Point 2 in the diagram)
    - Changed parameters: Pressure
    - Function: The left ventricle builds pressure until the pressure in the aorta is reached, while no volume is ejected yet (isovolumetric contraction)
- 2) Expulsion phase (see: Point 2 → Point 3 in the diagram)
    - Changed parameters: pressure and volume
    - Function: Opening of the pocket flaps and expulsion of the stroke volume with maximum systolic pressure

#### Diastole

- 3) Relaxation phase (see: Point 3 → Point 4 in the diagram)
    - Changed parameters: Pressure
    - Function: Closing of the pocket valves and decrease of the ventricular inner pressure (isovolumetric), until the pressure in the atria is fallen below, then opening of the atrioventricular valves
- 4) Filling phase (see point 4 → point 1 in the diagram)
    - Changed parameters: Pressure << Volume
    - Function: Ventricles fill with blood until the pressure in the atria is exceeded, closure of the atrioventricular valves.

### Overview of the Curves of the Work Diagram

|Curves|Statement|Benefit|Determination|
|---|---|---|---|
|Heart Relaxation Curve|- Indicates the passive stretchability of a relaxed heart|- Description of heart work (represents the diastolic filling phase in the work diagram)<br>- Starting point for the construction of the curve of isovolumetric and isobaric maxima|- Volume supply to a denervated heart and measurement of the resulting pressure ("stretch")|
|Curve of Support Maxima (U-Curve)|- Represents the actual pressure/volume changes during the auxotonic contraction of the heart, starting from the respective filling state on the resting length curve.|- Description of Cardiac Work (The intersection with the U-Curve marks the end of the ejection phase in the work diagram)|1. From any point A on the resting length curve, the isovolumetric maximum is determined → Starting point of the support curve<br>2. From the same point A (as in 1.) on the resting length curve, the isobaric maximum is determined → Connection point of the support curve<br>3. Straight connection of the points determined in 1. and 2. → Curve of Support Maxima is formed|
|Curves for the construction of the U-curve|   |   |   |
|Curve of Isovolumetric Maxima|- Starting from the filling state on the resting length curve, the pressure exerted during an isovolumetric contraction is indicated|- Serves for the construction of the curve of support maxima|- A denervated heart was isovolumetrically contracted from the respective filling state on the resting length curve, and the maximum pressure generated was measured|
|Curve of Isobaric Maxima|- Based on the filling state on the resting strain curve, the volume that can be ejected maximally during isobaric contraction is specified|- A denervated heart was isobarically contracted, based on the respective filling state on the resting strain curve, and the maximum ejected volume was measured|

### Pressure-Volume Work of the Heart

The heart performs two different types of work: acceleration work (a negligibly small portion, thus not considered here) and pressure-volume work. The work of the heart in the work diagram is therefore primarily determined by the blood volume (x-axis) that it must pump against the pressure (y-axis) of the large vessels. This results in the pressure-volume work of the heart, which is graphically represented by the area on the work diagram enclosed by the four phases of the cardiac cycle.

- Calculation regulation
    - Work = Pressure × Volume
    - Work of the heart = Systolic pressure × Stroke volume → W = p × V
        - Units: Work = W [J]; Pressure = p [N/m2]; Volume = V [m3]

> [!NOTE]
> For determining cardiac work, the resting stretch curve and the curve of support maxima are particularly necessary. The curve of isobaric and isovolumetric maxima is only needed for constructing the curve of support maxima!

## Regulation of Cardiac Activity

The heart can, thanks to its pacemaker centers, generate excitation independently; however, it must adapt its work in daily life to the constantly changing demands. The intrinsic Frank-Starling mechanism provides adjustment to short-term changes. Long-term changes in heart activity are regulated by the autonomic nervous system.

### Frank-Starling Mechanism

- Definition: Short-term automatic compensation mechanism for pressure and volume fluctuations
- Goal: The stroke volume of both ventricles should remain the same.
- Basic Concepts
    - Preload: End-diastolic volume in the ventricle and the resulting tension of the myocardium
    - Afterload: Mean arterial pressure in the aorta or pulmonary artery and the associated ejection resistance for the left or right ventricle.
- Possible causes of the Frank-Starling mechanism:
    1. Improved overlap of actin and myosin filaments
    2. Increased sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium

#### Increase in preliminary loader in the work diagram

- Starting point: Increased preload (increased end-diastolic volume in the ventricle)
- Process
    1. Due to the increased end-diastolic volume, the starting point on the resting length-tension curve shifts to the right.
    2. Increased pre-stretching of the heart enhances its contraction strength.
    3. Generated blood pressure remains unchanged, but stroke volume increases.
    4. By expelling the increased stroke volume, the starting point on the resting stretch curve is almost reached.
- Conclusion
    - Ejected stroke volume: Increased
    - Heart work: Increased
    - End-systolic volume: Almost normalized
    - Generated systolic blood pressure: Unchanged

#### Load Increase in the Work Diagram

- Starting point: Increased pressure in the aorta that the left ventricle must pump against.
- Process
    1. Stronger isovolumetric contraction until the increased pressure in the aorta is exceeded.
    2. Ejection of reduced stroke volume against increased pressure → Curve of support maxima is reached earlier
3. Due to reduced stroke volume, less volume is ejected from the ventricle → Ejection fraction decreases and leaves increased end-systolic volume in the ventricle.
    4. Increased end-systolic filling leads to increased end-diastolic filling → The reference point on the resting stretch curve is shifted to the right
    5. In analogy to the preload increase, the stroke volume now rises or normalizes.
- Conclusion
    - Ejected stroke volume: Initially decreased, normalized in the second cycle.
    - Heart work: Increased
    - Intraventricular volumes (after preload increase):
        - 1. Cycle: Increased end-systolic volume
        - 2. Cycle: Increased end-diastolic volume = preload increase (further process see preload increase)
    - Generated systolic blood pressure: Increased

> [!NOTE]
> The Frank-Starling mechanism leads to a short-term increase in cardiac work!

> [!NOTE]
> During inspiration, the intrathoracic pressure decreases and the intra-abdominal pressure increases, causing the venous return to the right heart, particularly from the superior vena cava, to increase. Due to the increased preload, the stroke volume of the right ventricle also rises. Simultaneously, under the expansion of the thorax, the capacity of the pulmonary vessels increases, which leads to a reduced venous return to the left heart and a lower preload. The result is a decreased stroke volume. During expiration, the opposite occurs.

> [!NOTE] Pulmonary embolism
> A pulmonary embolism (PE) refers to the obstruction of a pulmonary artery, which is usually caused by detached thrombi. If the total cross-section of the pulmonary circulation decreases, this leads, according to the Hagen-Poiseuille law, to an exponential increase in flow resistance, that is, the afterload. Due to the increased afterload in the right ventricle, there is an increased systolic pressure in both the right ventricle and the pulmonary circulation via the Frank-Starling mechanism. In the case of a massive (so-called fulminant) pulmonary embolism, right heart failure and ultimately a life-threatening cardiogenic shock are imminent. In this case, the embolus should be dissolved promptly by thrombolysis or removed using a catheter (embolectomy).

### Autonomic Nervous System of the Heart

The vegetative nervous system is capable of regulating heart action in the long term. The parasympathetic fibers only reach the atria, whereas the sympathetic fibers reach both the atria and the ventricles. Therefore, the sympathetic system can, in contrast to the parasympathetic system, even change the contraction strength of the ventricles (inotropy).

- Definition: Modulation of heart action through nerve impulses in sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nerve fibers
- Goal: Long-term adjustment of heart action
- Basic concepts of modulation of cardiac action
    - Chronotropy: Change in heart rate
    - Dromotropism: Change in the conduction velocity from atria to ventricles
    - Inotropy: Change in contraction strength
    - Lusitropy: Change in the relaxation speed
    - Bathmotropy: Change in stimulus threshold

#### Sympathetic Nervous System

- Innervation area: Atria and chambers with fibers from the sympathetic trunk
- Nerves: Superior, middle, and inferior cervical cardiac nerves
- Modulation of the heart
    - Fundamental principle
        1. Activation of β1 receptors in the heart by adrenaline or noradrenaline → Increase in adenylate cyclase activity → Increase in intracellular cAMP concentration
        2. Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by cAMP → Modulation of the activity of various key enzymes and transporters through phosphorylation
    - Effects
        - Positive chronotropic
            - Increase in cAMP concentration in pacemaker cells → Direct interaction of cAMP and Funny Channels
            - Increased opening of funny channels → Influx of cations during spontaneous depolarization → Steeper rise of the action potential
            - Threshold potential is reached earlier and the action potential duration is shortened → Faster action potential sequence → Increase in contraction frequency (heart rate)
        - Positive dromotropic
            - Increase in the conductivity of L-type calcium channels in the cell membrane of the AV node → Faster calcium influx during the upstroke of the action potential
            - Calcium influx leads to a steeper ascent of the action potential → Faster conduction
        - Positive inotrope
            - Principle: Increase of intracellular calcium concentration during the plateau phase → Strengthening of contraction force
            - Causes
                1. Increased conductivity of L-type calcium channels in the working myocardium due to phosphorylation → Enhanced calcium influx during the plateau phase → Increased calcium-induced calcium release
                2. By disinhibition (activation) of the SERCA, more calcium ions are supplied to the SR → Increased calcium release from the SR through the ryanodine receptor during the next contraction → Slight increase in contractile force (indirectly positive inotropic)
                3. Increased calcium efflux from the ryanodine receptor in the SR into the cytosol → Elevated intracellular calcium concentration
        - Positive lutenizing
            - Protein kinase A phosphorylates the regulatory protein phospholamban (which normally inhibits SERCA) → Phospholamban activity decreases → SERCA inhibition decreases
            - Activity of SERCA increased → Accelerated transport of calcium from the cytosol to the sarcoplasmic reticulum after contraction → Accelerated relaxation

> [!NOTE]
> The heart work (enclosed area in the work diagram) can indeed be increased by both the Frank-Starling mechanism and the sympathetic nervous system; however, these are two completely different molecular mechanisms!

> [!NOTE]
> A prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to damage to the endothelial cells of the vessels due to the resulting persistently elevated blood pressure!

#### Parasympathetic Nervous System

- Innervation area: Only atria with fibers from the vagus nerve
- Nerves
    - Thoracic cardiac nerves
    - Superior and inferior cervical cardiac nerves
- Effect on the heart via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors: The main targets are the sinoatrial node for frequency reduction (negative chronotropic) and the atrioventricular node to delay the conduction of excitation from the atria to the ventricles (negative dromotropic).
    - Negative chronotrope (The heart rate is regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system through two different pathways: on one hand by influencing the funny channels and on the other hand by opening potassium channels).
        - Cause 1: ACh increases the permeability of potassium channels in the sarcolemma of pacemaker cells → Enhanced potassium efflux → Membrane potential is shifted toward the potassium potential (therefore decreases) → Delayed reaching of the threshold potential
        - Cause 2: Acetylcholine inhibits adenylate cyclase via inhibitory G-protein → cAMP concentration decreases → Conductance of Funny Channels is reduced → Slower cation influx during depolarization → Delayed depolarization
    - Negative dromotropic
        - ACh increases the permeability of potassium channels in the sarcolemma of AV node cells → Enhanced potassium efflux → Membrane potential shifts towards the potassium potential (decreases, similar to Cause 1) → Flatter rise of the action potential → Delayed conduction
        - Conduction of excitation is either slowed down by the more negative membrane potential or, in cases of strong vagal stimulation, even completely interrupted (AV block)

> [!NOTE] Heart failure
> If the heart is unable to maintain the required cardiac output, it is referred to as heart failure (= cardiac weakness). It can affect the left, right, or both heart chambers; accordingly, a distinction is made between left, right, and global heart failure. Furthermore, heart failure can be classified into systolic and diastolic heart failure based on the primarily affected cardiac phase. In systolic heart failure, the pumping function is impaired; a reduced ejection fraction (EF) and an enlarged end-diastolic diameter of the affected heart chamber are typically observed. In contrast, diastolic heart failure occurs due to impaired filling of the heart chamber, which is why the end-diastolic diameter is rather low. Initially, a reduced EF can be compensated for by neuroendocrine compensation (increased sympathetic tone, RAAS activation, ADH release) and the Frank-Starling mechanism. However, in the long term, these mechanisms increase the workload on the heart and can even lead to a worsening of heart failure, which is why they are the target of many medications. Since the pumping capacity of the heart is no longer sufficient, there is a backlog of blood in front of the affected heart chambers. In left heart failure, the blood backs up into the pulmonary circulation. The subsequently increased capillary pressure in the lungs promotes the leakage of fluid from the pulmonary vessels, which can lead to the development of pulmonary edema with shortness of breath. In right heart failure, blood backs up into the systemic circulation, which can result in leg edema and congestive liver.

> [!NOTE] Medications for the modulation of heart action
> The functional and regulatory mechanisms of the heart can be manipulated pharmacologically. If the heart rate or blood pressure needs to be lowered, for example, the effect of the sympathetic nervous system on the β-receptors of the heart can be blocked by so-called beta-blockers. On the other hand, if an increase in pumping power (e.g., in the context of heart failure) is desired, this can be achieved, among other things, through cardiac glycosides. By inhibiting the sodium/potassium ATPase, they indirectly ensure an increased intracellular calcium supply, allowing the contractile apparatus to generate greater contraction force.

## Hertz Tones and Sounds

Heart sounds are sounds that are generated during the physiological action of the heart. They can be altered in the context of pathological processes (e.g., at the heart valves). These pathological heart sounds are referred to as heart murmurs and can be heard at characteristic locations on the chest using a stethoscope.

### (Physiological) Heart Sounds

- 1. Heart tone
    - Cause: Arises from wall tension of the ventricles at the beginning of systole
    - Time: Tension phase
- 2. Heart tone
    - Cause: Closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves
    - Time: Relaxation phase

### Typical Auscultation Sites of Heart Valves

The heart sounds generated by the heart are transmitted with the blood flow, including through the respective heart valves. If these heart valves are pathologically altered (e.g., narrowed), the heart sounds are changed in a characteristic way and are referred to as heart murmurs. These heart murmurs are transmitted from each heart valve to a typical auscultation site on the chest.

- Aortic valve: 2nd intercostal space on the right, parasternal
- Pulmonary valve: 2nd intercostal space left, parasternal
- Tricuspid valve: 4th intercostal space on the right, parasternal
- Mitral valve: 5th intercostal space on the left, midclavicular.
- Erb point: 3. ICR left, parasternal

> [!NOTE]
> "Anton Pulmann drinks milk at 10:45 PM"

> [!NOTE] Heart sounds
> If blood flows through a leaky (insufficient) or narrowed (stenosed) heart valve, it becomes turbulent, resulting in so-called heart murmurs. These are transmitted to the typical auscultation sites and can be detected there using a stethoscope. Unlike physiological heart sounds, heart murmurs are considered pathological in medicine. Sounds during systole (systolic murmur) are distinguished from sounds during diastole (diastolic murmur). The atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid valves) cause a diastolic murmur in the case of stenosis and a systolic murmur in the case of insufficiency. For the aortic and pulmonary valves, it is exactly the opposite.

## Calculation of the Fick Principle for HZV

Since the cardiac output (CO) is difficult or cumbersome to determine in clinical practice, there is a need for a method that can estimate CO based on easily measurable parameters. The Fick principle employs an indicator dilution method and allows for the calculation of cardiac output based on the oxygen uptake of the lungs and the arteriovenous oxygen concentration difference. Like all indicator dilution methods, it is based on the fundamental assumption that the amount of substance taken up by an organ per unit of time corresponds to the difference between the amount of substance supplied and removed per unit of time.

- Derivation
    - Amount of substance recorded/time = (Current strength × Substance concentration before the organ) − (Current strength × Substance concentration after the organ)
    - Amount of substance absorbed/time = Current strength × (Substance concentration before the organ − Substance concentration after the organ)
    - Current strength = (Amount of substance absorbed/Time) / (Substance concentration before the organ − Substance concentration after the organ)
- Fundamental considerations regarding Fick's principle
    - HZV is difficult to determine in clinical practice → Calculation using the indicator dilution method with easily measurable indicator (usually oxygen)
    - Measurement of the concentration difference of oxygen in arterial and venous blood using blood gas analysis (arterial O2 concentration - venous O2 concentration)
    - Oxygen uptake of the lungs per unit of time measurable by spirometry (VolumeO2/Time)
    - Calculation of the lung's volumetric flow rate using Fick's principle, which approximately corresponds to the cardiac output.
- Calculation regulation
    - HZV = O2 uptake of the lung / arteriovenous O2 concentration difference
    - HZV = (VO2/t) / (CAO2 − CVO2)
    - Similarly, with the same basic assumption, stroke volume can also be calculated: SV = (VO2/t) / (HR × (CAO2 − CVO2))
- Example Calculation
    - Given
        - O2 concentration (arterial and venous) = CAO2 and CVO2 L O2/L [blood] determined by blood gas analysis
        - Oxygen uptake of the lungs = VO2/t L O2/min] measured with spirometry
    - Sought: HZV [L/min]
    - Calculation
        - HZV = (VO2/t) / (CAO2 − CVO2) → Inserting measured values (here normal values)
        - HZV = (0.3 L/min) / (0.2−0.15) L O2 per L blood = (0.3 L/min) / 0.05 = 6 L/min

> [!NOTE]
> Oxygen is often used as an indicator to determine cardiac output. However, cardiac output can also be determined with other indicators, such as CO2 elimination!

## Wall tension of the heart according to Laplace

The law of Laplace is used in medicine to describe the wall tension of hollow organs such as blood vessels or the heart. Here, wall tension (K) is understood as the force that holds the hollow organ together. The forces that "burst" the hollow organ (ptm × r / 2d) are contrasted here. Based on the Laplace law, not only can the physiological changes in wall tension be described, but also the pathophysiological remodeling processes in the heart in certain diseases (e.g., hypertension) can be traced.

- Definition: Force within the heart wall that opposes the tendency to pull apart during stretching and "holds" the heart wall together.
- Laplace's Law: K = ptm × r / 2d
    - Units: K = Wall stress [N×m−2], ptm = [Transmural pressure, approximately corresponds to the ventricular inner pressure [N×m−2], r = Inner radius of the ventricle [m], d = Myocardial wall diameter [m]
- Application examples
    - Systole (Ejection Phase): Ventricular inner radius (r)↓ and myocardial wall diameter (d)↑ → Wall tension (K)↓
    - Diastole (filling phase): Ventricular inner radius (r)↑ and myocardial wall diameter (d)↓ → Wall tension (K)↑

> [!NOTE]
> The wall tension of the heart decreases during systole, even though the generated pressure increases!

> [!NOTE] Pressure hypertrophy
> When an increased ejection resistance is opposed to the heart (for example, due to an increased blood pressure), an increased transmural pressure (ptm) must be exerted to overcome this resistance. As a result, the wall tension (K) increases. In order for this wall tension to normalize again, the myocardial wall diameter (d) must increase. This occurs as the cardiomyocytes enlarge towards the center of the ventricle, i.e., they undergo concentric hypertrophy. Consequently, the inner radius of the ventricle (r) simultaneously decreases. The resulting hypertrophy pattern is referred to as pressure hypertrophy. However, this compensatory mechanism only works within a certain range.

> [!NOTE] Volume hypertrophy
> If, for example, insufficiently closing heart valves (e.g., aortic valve insufficiency) lead to an increasing burden on a ventricle due to increased blood volume, the heart attempts to compensate for this with a structural change. It enlarges its inner diameter (inner diameter = 2 × inner radius “r” of the ventricle) while simultaneously increasing the myocardial wall thickness, which is referred to as eccentric or volume hypertrophy. A so-called volume overload therefore results in a different hypertrophy pattern than a pressure overload (see above).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Heart Mechanics
### Basic Parameters of Heart Function

What is the definition of cardiac output and how is it calculated?
- Cardiac output (CO) is the volume ejected by the left ventricle per unit of time (usually per minute). It is calculated as CO = stroke volume × heart rate.

Explain the relationship between end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, ejection fraction, and stroke volume.
- The end-diastolic volume (EDV) refers to the blood volume located in the ventricle at the end of diastole. The blood remaining in the ventricle following contraction is the end-systolic volume (ESV). The difference between EDV and ESV is the stroke volume (SV), i.e., the volume ejected during systole. The ejection fraction is the proportion of the EDV ejected during contraction, calculated as EF = SV / EDV. In healthy individuals, it should be at least 55%.

How do end-diastolic and end-systolic volume, as well as ejection fraction and stroke volume, behave in systolic left heart failure?
- In systolic left heart failure, the stroke volume of the left ventricle decreases, meaning that the ejection fraction falls and the end-systolic volume increases. Due to reduced blood flow and increased pressure, the ventricle dilates, i.e., the end-diastolic diameter enlarges, which leads to an increase in end-diastolic volume.

### Phases of Cardiac Action

Which two fundamental phases of the heart's action are distinguished?
- The cardiac action can be divided into diastole and systole. During diastole, the ventricles fill with blood; during systole, blood is pumped from the ventricles into the systemic and pulmonary circulation.

The systole can be further subdivided into additional phases. Name these and their characteristics.
- Systole is subdivided into isovolumetric contraction phase and ejection phase. In the isovolumetric contraction phase, the ventricles are fully excited and contract, causing the left ventricular pressure to rise from 8 mmHg to 80 mmHg. The left ventricular volume remains constant (isovolumetric) at approximately 150 mL. When the semilunar valves open, the ejection phase begins. Blood is rapidly ejected due to high pressure. Left ventricular pressure rises further to 120 mmHg, followed by a pressure decrease. The ejection phase ends with the closure of the semilunar valves.

The diastole can be subdivided into further phases. Name these and their characteristics.
- Diastole is subdivided into relaxation and filling phases. In the relaxation phase, the ventricles relax, and pressure further declines in the left ventricle to about 10 mmHg, while volume remains constant at 60 mL. With the opening of the atrioventricular valves, the filling phase begins, at the end of which the atria briefly contract, which is especially relevant for filling during high heart rates. When ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure, the atrioventricular valves close, and the isovolumetric contraction phase of systole begins. At this point, left ventricular pressure is about 8 mmHg and volume about 150 mL.

How do the pressures in the atria behave during the cardiac cycle?
- The atria belong to the low-pressure system. Their pressures change only slightly during the cardiac cycle, ranging between 0 mmHg (right atrium during diastole) and 10 mmHg (left atrium during systole).

### Working Diagram of the Heart

What work can be read in the heart's work diagram?
- The work diagram represents the pressure-volume work of the heart, with volume displayed on the x-axis and pressure on the y-axis.

How is the pressure-volume work calculated?
- The pressure-volume work describes the heart's work and is indicated as W [J]. It is calculated from systolic pressure p [N/m²] × stroke volume V [m³], i.e., W = p × V. To determine this in the work diagram, mainly the resting stretch curve and the curve of maximal elastance are required.

### Regulation of Cardiac Activity

What mechanisms serve to adjust heart activity?
- The Frank-Starling mechanism serves as a short-term automatic compensation for pressure and volume fluctuations to keep the stroke volumes of both ventricles equal. For longer-term adjustment, the autonomic nervous system is responsible, where the parasympathetic system via the vagus nerve reaches only the atria, whereas the sympathetic system affects both atria and ventricles.

What are the two fundamental concepts of the Frank-Starling mechanism?
- Preload and afterload are the two basic concepts of the Frank-Starling mechanism. Preload refers to the ventricular end-diastolic volume and the resulting stretch of the myocardium. Afterload describes the mean blood pressure in the aorta or pulmonary artery and the resulting ejection resistance for the left and right ventricles, respectively.

What effect does an increase in afterload have on cardiac work?
- An increase in afterload—i.e., elevated pressure in the aorta against which the left ventricle must pump—leads to a reduced stroke volume ejected from the ventricle during the first cycle. Consequently, end-systolic and subsequently end-diastolic volumes increase in the ventricle. In the next cycle, due to this preload increase, the stroke volume normalizes again. This so-called Frank-Starling mechanism serves as a short-term compensation for pressure or volume fluctuations.

What are the basic principles of the adaptation of heart activity by the sympathetic nervous system?
- The sympathetic system activates β1-receptors in the heart via adrenaline or noradrenaline, increasing adenylate cyclase activity and thereby leading to an intracellular rise of cAMP. cAMP activates protein kinase A, which modulates the activity of various key enzymes and transporters through phosphorylation.

Name the effects of increased sympathetic activity on the heart.
- The sympathetic nervous system exerts positive inotropic (increased contractile force), chronotropic (increased heart rate), dromotropic (increased conduction velocity), and lusitropic (accelerated relaxation) effects on the heart.

What is referred to as positive inotropy?
- A positive inotropic effect means increased contractile strength, enabled by elevated intracellular calcium concentration during the plateau phase. This increased calcium is due partly to increased permeability of L-type calcium channels in working myocardium and partly because inhibition of SERCA results in more calcium being supplied to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (indirectly positive inotropic), which leads to increased calcium release from the ryanodine receptor in the SR into the cytosol.

What effect can prolonged sympathetic activity have on small blood vessels?
- Long-term activation of the sympathetic system leads to chronically elevated blood pressure, which can cause damage to the vascular endothelium.

How do cardiac glycosides work?
- Cardiac glycosides act positively inotropic on the heart by inhibiting the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, thereby indirectly increasing intracellular calcium availability.

### Hertz Tones and Sounds

Through what and at what moment does the first heart sound occur?
- The first heart sound arises during the isovolumetric contraction phase of systole due to ventricular wall tension.

Through what and at what moment does the second heart sound occur?
- The second heart sound arises during the relaxation phase of diastole at the closure of the semilunar valves.

Name the typical auscultation sites of the valves.
- Heart sounds are transmitted by the valves and the blood flow, so each valve has a typical auscultation point on the chest. Aortic valve: 2nd intercostal space on the right, parasternal. Pulmonary valve: 2nd intercostal space on the left, parasternal. Tricuspid valve: 4th intercostal space on the right, parasternal. Mitral valve: 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. Erb’s point: 3rd intercostal space on the left, parasternal, providing an overall impression of all heart sounds and murmurs.

### Calculation of the Fick Principle for Cardiac Output

How is the cardiac output determined using Fick's principle?
- Fick's principle uses the oxygen uptake of the lungs and the arteriovenous oxygen difference to calculate cardiac output, i.e., CO = oxygen uptake by the lungs / (arterial O2 content – venous O2 content).

### Wall tension of the heart according to Laplace

How is the wall tension of the heart calculated according to Laplace?
- According to Laplace’s law, the wall tension of hollow organs can be calculated as K = ptm × r / 2d. For the heart, this means: K = wall tension [N·m⁻²], ptm = transmural pressure, approximately equal to left ventricular pressure [N·m⁻²], r = inner radius of the ventricle [m], d = myocardial wall thickness [m].

Explain the significance of Laplace’s law for the heart in your own words!
- Laplace's law is based on Laplace's insight that the force holding a sphere (here the heart) together must be exactly as large as the force tending to burst this sphere to preserve its shape. The force holding the sphere together is the wall tension K. The forces trying to burst it can be represented succinctly as ptm × r / 2d. This means K is inversely proportional to wall thickness. If the ventricular wall thickness increases, wall tension decreases. Conversely, wall tension rises with increasing ventricular pressure and inner radius. The law can be illustrated using pressure hypertrophy: with elevated blood pressure, a higher ventricular pressure must be generated to eject blood, which simultaneously increases wall tension. To normalize this tension, myocardial wall thickness grows as cardiomyocytes hypertrophy concentrically. This however reduces the inner radius so that mechanical balance is restored. This compensation pattern, however, functions only within certain limits.
