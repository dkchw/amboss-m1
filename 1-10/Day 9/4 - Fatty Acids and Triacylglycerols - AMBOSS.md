# Fatty Acids and Triacylglycerols
## Summary

Fatty acids and triacylglycerols (TAGs) are important energy carriers of the organism. They are stored in adipose tissue and can be mobilized from there and broken down with the release of energy when needed.

The fatty acids present in the body are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids with unbranched hydrocarbon chains, with these chains typically being 4 to 24 carbon atoms long. Fatty acids primarily serve in the organism as components of various lipids and are mostly esterified with alcohols (e.g., with glycerol, sphingosine, or cholesterol). Partially, fatty acids also exist in a free form and are then referred to as free fatty acids. Additionally, a distinction is made between non-essential and essential fatty acids: non-essential fatty acids can be synthesized by the organism using fatty acid synthase, while essential fatty acids must be obtained through the diet. The fatty acids present in the diet are broken down in the cells through β-oxidation; during this process, energy is released in the form of ATP.

TAGs are the storage form of fatty acids in the organism. They consist of one molecule of glycerin that is esterified with three fatty acids. The TAG metabolism is subject to strict regulation by the hormone-sensitive lipase of adipose tissue.
## Chemical Structure

### Fatty Acids

Fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids with unbranched carbon chains consisting of about 4–24 carbon atoms.

- Nomenclature
    - By chain length
        - Short-chain fatty acids (4–7 C atoms)
        - Medium-chain fatty acids (8–12 carbon atoms)
        - Long-chain fatty acids (>12 C-atoms)
    - After double bonds
        - Saturated fatty acids (alkanoic acids): No double bonds
        - Unsaturated fatty acids (alkenoic acids): At least one double bond
            - Monounsaturated fatty acids: Only one double bond
            - Polyunsaturated fatty acids: Multiple double bonds
    - Essential fatty acids: Fatty acids that the organism needs but cannot synthesize on its own.
- Rules for Naming
    - Numbering as with all carboxylic acids (see: Nomenclature of hydrocarbons)
    - The position of a double bond is indicated with Delta (Δ) and a superscript number following it, when counting from the carboxyl group.
    - The position of a double bond is indicated with Omega (ω) followed by a number when counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid.
    - Depending on the position of the substituents on both sides of the double bond, the double bond is named "cis" or "trans" (see also: configurational isomers)
- Properties of fatty acids
    - The carboxylic acid group (COOH group) is polar and hydrophilic, while the hydrocarbon part is nonpolar and hydrophobic.
    - The longer a fatty acid, the higher its melting point.
    - Fatty acids with cis double bonds are bent or "kinked," which allows them to pack less tightly together.
    - The more (cis-)double bonds present in a fatty acid, the lower its melting point.
    - Unsaturated fatty acids can be radically oxidized by oxygen (so-called lipid peroxidation). The fatty acid radical is formed in the molecular position where it can be best stabilized. For unsaturated fatty acids without additional functional groups, the general rule for oxidation probability is: α-position to two double bonds > α-position to one double bond.

### Triacylglycerol

Triacylglycerides (TAGs) are important dietary components and the storage form of fatty acids. They consist of one glycerol molecule esterified with three fatty acids. See also the corresponding sections: Lipogenesis (for synthesis), Lipolysis (breakdown), and Regulation of TAG metabolism.

- TAGs: All three hydroxyl groups of glycerin are esterified with fatty acids.
- Monoacyl-/Diacylglycerine: Only one or two of the hydroxyl groups of glycerol are esterified with fatty acids.

## Digestion and Absorption

- Digestion and absorption: See: lipid digestion and absorption
- Further processing in enterocytes
    - Short- and medium-chain fatty acids: Pass through the enterocytes and enter the portal vein blood, where they are transported bound to albumin.
    - Long-chain fatty acids: Are activated and re-esterified with monoacylglycerol, resulting in the formation of TAGs again.
        1. Activation
            - Fatty acid is transferred to a molecule of coenzyme A by acyl-CoA synthetase.
            - An activated fatty acid (Acyl-CoA) is formed.
        2. Esterification
            - Monoacylglycerol and activated fatty acids (Acyl-CoA) again form TAGs.
            - Transport of the TAGs to the Golgi apparatus
        3. Formation of chylomicrons
            - Association with the amphiphilic apolipoprotein B-48 and phospholipids
        4. Secretion: Chylomicrons are secreted into the lymph and enter the blood via the thoracic duct.

## Reduction

### Degradation of Fatty Acids

- Goal: Energy generation
- Location: On the outer side of the mitochondria and in the mitochondrial matrix
- Process: Takes place in three steps
    1. Activation of fatty acids (on the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane)
        - Enzyme: Acyl-CoA synthetase, catalyzes two reaction steps
            1. Reaction of the fatty acid with ATP, resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid-phosphoric acid anhydride in the form of acyl adenylate.
            2. Transfer of the acyl group to coenzyme A (CoA), resulting in acyl-CoA and AMP
    2. Transport of Acyl-CoA into the Mitochondria
        1. The acyl group is transferred to carnitine with the release of the CoA residue (Enzyme: Acylcarnitine Transferase I)
        2. Acylcarnitine enters the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion through porins.
        3. Acylated carnitine is actively transported through the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix via the carnitine-acylcarnitine transporter (CACT).
        4. In the matrix, the acyl group is transferred back to a CoA (enzyme: Acylcarnitine Transferase II)
    3. β-Oxidation (in the mitochondrial matrix): Cyclical process in which fatty acids are degraded from the carboxyl end.
        - Two C atoms are cleaved off in the form of acetyl-CoA, and the remaining fatty acid is oxidized at the β-C atom.
        - For each cleaved acetyl-CoA unit, one molecule of FAD, water (H2O), and NAD+ is required.
        - The resulting acetyl-CoA molecules are then fed into the citric acid cycle.

> [!NOTE]
> Acyl-CoA and Acetyl-CoA must not be confused with each other! Acyl-CoA is a collective term for all activated fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA is the Acyl-CoA of acetic acid ("acetate")!

> [!NOTE]
> The enoyl-CoA hydratase can only utilize the trans form of enoyl-CoA. If cis-enoyl-CoA is produced by exception, it is converted into trans-enoyl-CoA by an isomerase!

> [!NOTE]
> MCAD deficiency, VLCAD deficiency, and LCHAD deficiency
> A very rare autosomal-recessive disorder is the defect of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is associated with a disturbance of fatty acid degradation. The first step of β-oxidation in the mitochondria cannot then take place, leading to an accumulation of the intermediate product acylcarnitine, a transport form of acyl-CoA. The disorder mostly affects the degradation of medium-chain fatty acids and is then referred to as MCAD deficiency (MCAD = medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase). If the degradation of long-chain fatty acids is affected, the defect is called VLCAD deficiency (VLCAD = very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) or LCHAD deficiency (LCHAD = long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase).

#### Degradation of long-chain fatty acids

The β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (especially those longer than 20 carbon atoms) to octanoyl-CoA (8 carbon atoms) occurs in the peroxisomes. Subsequently, these shorter C8 fatty acids are transported to the mitochondria for further degradation. The first step of β-oxidation – the oxidation between the C2 and C3 atoms of acyl-CoA – takes place differently in the peroxisomes than in the mitochondria.

- Peroxisomes: β-Oxidation up to C8 body
    - Step 1 (Oxidation between C2 and C3)
        - Flavoprotein dehydrogenase oxidizes acyl-CoA to trans-enoyl-CoA (during this process, FAD is reduced to FADH2)
        - FADH2 + O2 → FAD + H2O2
        - The enzyme catalase subsequently converts 2H2O2 into 2H2O and O2.
    - Steps 2 to 4: Correspond to the reaction steps as they also occur in mitochondria (see above)
- Mitochondria: β-Oxidation of C8 fatty acids

#### Breakdown of odd-chain fatty acids

Odd-numbered fatty acids also undergo β-oxidation. However, in the final step, instead of Acetyl-CoA, Propionyl-CoA remains, which is converted into Succinyl-CoA and fed into the citric acid cycle.

- Reaction steps
    - Carboxylation of Propionyl-CoA to Methylmalonyl-CoA (Enzyme: Propionyl-CoA Carboxylase, Cofactor: Biotin)
    - Conversion of Methylmalonyl-CoA to Succinyl-CoA (Enzyme: Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase, Cofactor: Cobalamin = Vit. B12)

#### Breakdown of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids

Multiple unsaturated fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid, are also broken down in β-oxidation. However, two additional enzymes are required for this: an isomerase and a reductase. These convert the double bonds and "shift" them so that the resulting fatty acid can be degraded by the enzymes of β-oxidation.

- Reaction steps using linolenic acid as an example
    1. Three regular breakdown cycles as in the β-oxidation of saturated fatty acids, until the first double bond of the polyunsaturated fatty acid is in the cis-Δ3 configuration.
    2. Isomerization of the cis-Δ3 double bond into a trans-Δ2 double bond by the cis-Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase.
    3. A breakdown cycle like that of β-oxidation of saturated fatty acids starting from the second reaction step (hydration), until the first of the two remaining double bonds lies between the C4 and C5 atoms (cis-Δ4 double bond)
    4. Introduction of an additional trans-double bond between C2 and C3 resulting in trans-Δ2-cis-Δ4-dienoyl-CoA by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
    5. Conversion of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to trans-Δ3-enoyl-CoA by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase
    6. Isomerization of trans-Δ3-enoyl-CoA to trans-Δ2-enoyl-CoA, also by the cis-Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase.
    7. Complete breakdown of the remaining acyl group in β-oxidation

### Breakdown of TAGs (Lipolysis)

Lipases break down TAGs into glycerol and three fatty acids. Glycerol is released from adipose tissue into the blood and, after activation, is incorporated into glycolysis as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), while the fatty acids are directed to β-oxidation.

## Synthesis and Storage

Saturated fatty acids can be produced by almost all cells in the human body; however, the main site of synthesis is the liver. Unsaturated fatty acids are also largely synthesized in the liver.

### Synthesis of Saturated Fatty Acids

In fatty acid synthesis, primarily palmitic acid (C16) and stearic acid (C18) are produced. The synthesis of fatty acids is not a reversal of β-oxidation. The following important differences exist:

#### The Fatty Acid Synthase

The fatty acid synthase is a multi-enzyme complex that catalyzes the majority of the reactions of fatty acid synthesis.

- Structure: The fatty acid synthase consists of two identical subunits (so-called homodimer), each containing three domains with different enzymatic activities. Of crucial importance are also the two reactive SH groups (the central and the peripheral SH group), to which the substrates remain bound throughout the entire synthesis.
    - Domain 1: Domain of substrate entry
        - Acetyl-Transacylase
        - ACP-Malonyl-Transacylase
        - Acyl-malonyl condensing enzyme
    - Domain 2: Domain of Acyl Residue Reduction
        - ACP (Acyl-Carrier-Protein)
        - β-Ketoacyl-Reductase
        - Dehydratase
        - Enoyl-Reductase
    - Domain 3: Domain of Release
        - Thioesterase

#### Process of Fatty Acid Synthesis

At the beginning of fatty acid synthesis, a starter acetyl group is formed. The acetyl-CoA needed for this is primarily generated from the end product of glycolysis, pyruvate. For this, cytosolic pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria with the help of a pyruvate carrier.

- Provision of cytosolic acetyl-CoA
    1. Citrate synthase: Catalyzes the synthesis of citrate from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate
    2. Citrate-Malate Shuttle: Transports citrate across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol.
    3. ATP-Citrate Lyase: Converts citrate back into Acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate in the cytosol, consuming ATP.
- Formation of the starter acetyl group
    - Acetyl-Transacylase: Transfers the acetyl group of an acetyl-CoA first to the central and then further to the peripheral SH group of the fatty acid synthase.

> [!NOTE]
> The cycle of fatty acid synthesis is traversed as often as necessary until the fatty acid is completed! The resulting fatty acid remains bound in the multienzyme complex for as long as that!

> [!NOTE]
> The fatty acid synthase synthesizes almost exclusively palmitic acid (C16) and stearic acid (C18)!

### Synthesis of Unsaturated Fatty Acids

The body requires not only saturated but also unsaturated fatty acids. The essential unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid) must be obtained through food, while non-essential unsaturated fatty acids can be synthesized in the liver from saturated fatty acids.

- Process
    - A complex of three membrane-bound enzymes, known as desaturase, which introduces double bonds into long-chain fatty acids on the cytosolic side of the smooth ER.
    - Oxidizing agent is molecular oxygen: For each double bond, two molecules of H2O are released.
- From the essential fatty acid linoleic acid, arachidonic acid can be synthesized, which serves as a starting material for the synthesis of eicosanoids.
    - Synthesis of arachidonic acid: Linoleic acid is desaturated at Δ6 → chain elongation by two C atoms → desaturation at Δ5

### Synthesis of TAGs (Lipogenesis)

The TAG synthesis mainly takes place in the liver and adipose tissue. Both glycerol and fatty acids must be activated for this process. The finished TAGs are either stored in adipose tissue or transported to the muscles as an energy source.

#### Activation

- Activation of the glycerol building block (synthesis of glycerol-3-phosphate)
    - Arises as a branch from glycolysis from the intermediate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DAP) through glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
    - Through the glycerokinase
    - Glycerin-3-phosphate can form a total of three ester bonds: two with long-chain fatty acids and another ester bond with an alcohol at the phosphate group (thus forming a phosphodiester)
- Activation of fatty acid building blocks (synthesis of Acyl-CoA)
    - Through the acyl-CoA synthetase

#### Process of TAG Synthesis

|Reaction|Substrate|Enzyme|Product|
|---|---|---|---|
|1. Linking of Glycerin-3-phosphate with two Acyl-CoA molecules|- Glycerin-3-phosphate<br>- 2 molecules of Acyl-CoA|- Glycerin-3-phosphate acyltransferase|- Phosphatidic acid|
|2. Cleavage of the phosphate residue|- Phosphatidic acid|- Phosphatidic phosphohydrolase|- 1,2-Diacylglycerol|
|3. Addition of another acyl group|- 1,2-Diacylglycerol|- Diacylglycerol acyltransferase|- Triacylglycerol|

### Storage of TAGs

TAGs are stored in the adipocytes of adipose tissue in the form of fat droplets.

- Formation of a fat droplet
    - Inside: TAGs
    - Outer: Shell made of the protein Perilipin

### Regulation

### Regulation of Fatty Acid Metabolism

The fatty acid metabolism is subject to strict regulation; synthesis and breakdown are regulated oppositely. Control is achieved both hormonally and allosterically through metabolic products.

#### Regulation of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase

The acetyl-CoA carboxylase serves as a key regulatory enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Regulation occurs through reversible phosphorylation, which can be triggered hormonally or by metabolic products. Negative feedback regulation also takes place.

- Regulation through metabolic products
    - AMP
        - Activates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
        - AMPK phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase using ATP, thereby inhibiting it.
    - ATP: Inhibits AMPK
    - Acyl-CoA
        - Inhibits the acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the sense of end-product inhibition.
    - Citrate
        - Activates the Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase
- Hormonal Regulation
    - Glucagon and catecholamines: Inhibit through the second messenger cAMP
        - cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA)
        - PKA phosphorylates the acetyl-CoA carboxylase and thereby inhibits it.
    - Insulin: Activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase
        - Additionally, insulin increases the synthesis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase through the transcription factor SREBP-1c.

> [!NOTE]
> The phosphorylated form of acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inactive, while the dephosphorylated form is active!

#### Regulation of Fatty Acid Synthesis

The fatty acid synthase is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level.

- Insulin and Glucose: Induce transcription via the transcription factor SREBP-1c
- Glucagon, catecholamines, fatty acids: Suppress transcription

### Regulation of TAG Metabolism

TAGs are important for the organism's energy balance, which is why their metabolism is subject to very strict regulatory mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon hormones and the secondary messenger cAMP play an important role in this.

- General aspects of regulation: The nutritional situation and the composition of food have an impact on TAG metabolism.
    - High carbohydrate content: Insulin-mediated stimulation of fatty acid synthesis, as excess glucose is stored as TAGs in adipose tissue.
    - High lipid content: Inhibits fatty acid synthesis, as TAGs can be directly synthesized from dietary fats.
    - Nutritional abstinence: Glucagon- and catecholamine-mediated increase in lipolysis and inhibition of fatty acid synthesis
- Specific regulation by individual hormones
    - Regulation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL): Occurs cAMP-dependent
        1. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA)
        2. PKA phosphorylates the HSL and thereby activates it.
        3. Diffusion of the HSL to the fat droplet
        4. PKA also phosphorylates perilipin, which then diffuses away from the fat droplet.
        5. HSL begins with the TAG cleavage.
    - Regulation of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase: Also cAMP-dependent and mediated by the transcription factor SREBP-1
        1. cAMP activates the PKA
        2. PKA phosphorylates the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and thereby inactivates it.
        3. In contrast, SREBP-1 induces glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase.
- Regulation of glucose availability: The fat cells obtain the required glycerol-3-phosphate from glycolysis. Therefore, the glucose availability of the cell is crucial.
    - High glucose availability: Stimulates lipogenesis
    - Low glucose availability: Stimulates lipolysis
- Regulation by Apolipoprotein C-II (Apo C-II): Component of chylomicrons and VLDL
    - Activates the lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed on the endothelium of muscle and adipose tissue → Breakdown of the TAGs contained in the chylomicrons

> [!NOTE] Hypertriglyceridemia
> An elevated concentration of TAGs in the blood is referred to as hypertriglyceridemia. It belongs to the larger group of lipid metabolism disorders (dyslipidemias) and can be both genetically (deficiency of lipoprotein lipase) and dietarily induced (obesity, alcoholism). Just like hyperlipoproteinemias, hypertriglyceridemia poses a risk for vascular diseases (atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusive disease).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Fatty Acids and Triacylglycerols
### Chemical Structure

How do unsaturated and saturated fatty acids differ in their chemical structure?
- Unsaturated fatty acids differ from saturated fatty acids by the presence of at least one double bond (C=C). Monounsaturated fatty acids contain only one double bond, polyunsaturated fatty acids have multiple double bonds.
What does the melting point of a fatty acid depend on?
- The shorter a fatty acid is, the lower its melting point. Additionally, the melting point depends on the number of cis double bonds: fatty acids with one or more cis double bonds (= unsaturated fatty acids) are bent, which causes them to pack less densely and orderly and to melt at a lower temperature.
What is the chemical name and the molecular formula of palmitic acid?
- Palmitic acid is a fully saturated hexadecanoic acid with the molecular formula C16H32O2.
What is the molecular formula of oleic acid? Where and in what form does it occur?
- Oleic acid is a monounsaturated fatty acid with the molecular formula C18H34O2. It is the main component of all oils and fats and usually occurs bound to glycerol in the form of triacylglycerols (TAGs).
How can the position of double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids be indicated? Illustrate this using the example of linolenic acid!
- The position of a double bond in an unsaturated fatty acid can be indicated in two ways. Counting from the carboxyl group, the position of all double bonds is indicated by delta (Δ) and superscript numbers following it. Counting from the methyl end of the fatty acid, the position of the first double bond is indicated by omega (ω) and a number. Linolenic acid is therefore also called Δ9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid and belongs to the omega-3 fatty acids.
Describe linoleic acid and arachidonic acid in terms of their chemical structure, the location of their double bonds, and their significance for the human body!
- Linoleic acid is a doubly unsaturated, essential fatty acid found in plant oils and depot fats. It is a Δ9,12-octadecadienoic acid and belongs to the group of omega-6 fatty acids. Arachidonic acid is a tetra-unsaturated fatty acid (Δ5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid), found mainly in fish oils but can also be synthesized in the body from linoleic acid. It is a component of many phosphoglycerides and a precursor for the synthesis of the so-called eicosanoids. Arachidonic acid also belongs to the omega-6 fatty acids.
### Digestion and Absorption

How are short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids further metabolized after their absorption by enterocytes?
- After absorption by enterocytes, short- and medium-chain fatty acids enter the portal venous blood, where they are transported bound to albumin. In contrast, long-chain fatty acids are first re-esterified to TAGs in enterocytes and packaged with other lipids into chylomicrons for release into the lymph.
### Reduction

Which part of fatty acid breakdown takes place in the cytosol?
- Before fatty acids can be degraded by β-oxidation, they must first be activated in two steps. For this, a fatty acid reacts on the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane with ATP, forming a carboxylic acid-phosphoric acid anhydride in the form of acyladenylate. By transferring the acyl group to coenzyme A (CoA), acyl-CoA and AMP are formed. Both reactions are catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthetase in the cytosol.
Where does the β-oxidation of fatty acids take place and what is its purpose?
- β-oxidation of fatty acids takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and serves energy production.
Describe roughly the steps of β-oxidation! What cofactors are needed and in what quantities?
- In the first, namesake step of β-oxidation, the fatty acid residue is oxidized at the β-C atom, during which one molecule of FAD is reduced to FADH2. This is followed by a hydration step, where one molecule of H2O is consumed. In the next step, the newly incorporated OH group is oxidized NAD+-dependently to a ketone. Finally, the C-C bond between C2 and C3 is cleaved, releasing an acetyl-CoA residue. Acetyl-CoA can enter the citric acid cycle, and the fatty acid residue is fed back to the first step of β-oxidation. This repeats until only two molecules of acetyl-CoA remain (in the case of even-numbered fatty acids).
During β-oxidation, two oxidations actually occur. Which enzymes catalyze each of these?
- In the first step of β-oxidation, acyl-CoA is oxidized at the C3 atom (Cβ) by the enzyme acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, forming a trans-configured double bond; the electron acceptor is FAD. L-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase oxidizes L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA in the third step using the cofactor NAD+.
Why must cis-Enoyl-CoA, which may have formed during β-oxidation, be converted into trans-Enoyl-CoA?
- The second step of β-oxidation is catalyzed by enoyl-CoA hydratase. This enzyme can only react with the trans form (double bond at the even C atom (trans-Δ2)) of enoyl-CoA formed in the first step. If a double bond occurs at an odd C atom (Δ3-cis), an isomerase converts this cis-Δ3 double bond into a trans-Δ2 double bond so that oxidation can proceed.
Which fatty acids are first degraded in the peroxisomes, and how does peroxisomal β-oxidation differ from mitochondrial β-oxidation?
- Long-chain fatty acids (with 20–25 C atoms) are first transported into peroxisomes, where β-oxidation proceeds up to a length of 8 C atoms. After shortening, they are transported to mitochondria for further degradation. The first step of peroxisomal β-oxidation differs from mitochondrial β-oxidation: oxidation of acyl-CoA to trans-enoyl-CoA in peroxisomes is catalyzed by flavoprotein dehydrogenase, reducing FAD. The formed FADH2 transfers its electrons to molecular oxygen and is regenerated to FAD; simultaneously, cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide (FADH2 + O2 → FAD + H2O2) is formed. The enzyme catalase then converts 2 H2O2 into 2 H2O and O2. The subsequent steps correspond to those of mitochondrial β-oxidation.
What end product is formed during the β-oxidation of odd-numbered fatty acids, and which cofactors are involved in its further metabolism?
- Odd-numbered fatty acids also undergo β-oxidation, but in the last step, propionyl-CoA remains instead of acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is carboxylated to methylmalonyl-CoA by biotin and subsequently converted to succinyl-CoA with the involvement of cobalamin (= vitamin B12). Succinyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle.
What reaction is catalyzed by glycerol kinase (syn. glycerokinase)? What two functions does it serve by doing so?
- Glycerol kinase (glycerokinase) is found mainly in liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. It phosphorylates glycerol under ATP consumption to α-glycerophosphate (glycerol-3-phosphate). On one hand, this activates glycerol, which can be linked to two fatty acids (and later a third fatty acid) in the process of TAG synthesis. On the other hand, it is also the first step in the reutilization of glycerol released during lipolysis of TAGs. In further steps, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate is formed, which enters glycolysis.
### Synthesis and Storage

What happens in the first step of fatty acid synthesis and what cofactors are required?
- In the first step of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase; cofactors biotin and ATP are required.
How is it prevented that newly formed free fatty acids are immediately broken down in the mitochondria?
- The transport of free fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix for degradation is mediated by the carnitine acyl-transferase system. To prevent newly synthesized fatty acids from being immediately broken down, this transport system (more precisely, acylcarnitine transferase I) is inhibited by the product of the first step of fatty acid synthesis, malonyl-CoA.
In which step of fatty acid synthesis is CO2 released?
- In reaction 3 of fatty acid synthesis, the acetyl residue of the peripheral SH group is transferred to the malonyl residue of the central SH group. The malonyl residue is decarboxylated in the process, releasing CO2, forming an acetoacetyl residue.
How are non-essential unsaturated fatty acids synthesized?
- The synthesis of non-essential unsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids takes place in the liver. So-called desaturases (complexes of three enzymes bound to the membrane of the smooth ER) insert double bonds into long-chain fatty acids. Molecular oxygen serves as the oxidizing agent: two molecules of H2O are released per double bond formed.
Describe the individual steps of arachidonic acid synthesis!
- Arachidonic acid is a tetra-unsaturated fatty acid that cannot be newly synthesized by the body but is formed from the essential, dietary linoleic acid (doubly unsaturated). Linoleic acid is first desaturated at Δ6 (single bond → double bond), then elongated by two C atoms and then desaturated again (at Δ5).
### Regulation

What is the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis and how is it activated or deactivated?
- Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis. Its regulation occurs by reversible phosphorylation triggered hormonally or by metabolic products. The phosphorylated form is inactive; the dephosphorylated form is active.
Explain the regulation of fatty acid synthesis through metabolic products!
- Fatty acid synthesis is regulated, among other things, by certain metabolic products that accumulate depending on the energy state of the body. Metabolic products indicating sufficient energy availability activate acetyl-CoA carboxylase, including citrate and ATP. Conversely, fatty acid synthesis is inhibited when energy shortage signs appear as elevated AMP levels: AMP activates AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and thereby inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Furthermore, acyl-CoA mediates feedback inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
How does insulin act anabolically in lipid metabolism in the short term?
- Insulin acts anabolically on lipid metabolism via both fast and slow regulatory mechanisms, i.e., it increases lipid synthesis. A rapid mechanism involves activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis.
