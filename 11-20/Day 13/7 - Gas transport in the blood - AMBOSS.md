# Gas transport in the blood
## Summary

The gas transport in humans mainly includes the distribution of O2 in the body as well as the removal of CO2. While the intake and release are performed by the lungs, the transport of gases is the responsibility of the blood: Here, the erythrocytes with their most important protein hemoglobin are in the foreground. Not only is the majority of oxygen transported via hemoglobin, but erythrocytes also facilitate the conversion of CO2 into the well-soluble bicarbonate.

The fundamental structure of erythrocytes as well as the properties of hemoglobin with the various hemoglobin types are presented in the corresponding chapters; here, we will further discuss the mechanisms of gas transport as well as the regulation and description of O2 affinity.
## Basics

### Solubility and Diffusion of Gases

Gases behave differently when dissolving in liquids than solids (such as salts). This is because gases do not have a fixed volume, but expand depending on pressure and temperature. For gases, partial pressure is typically considered rather than concentration. The physical solubility of gases in water is not particularly high, which is especially important in relation to the physiologically significant solubility of oxygen in blood.

- Solubility of gases
    - Dependent on
        - Liquid in which the gas is dissolved: Described by solubility coefficients
        - Temperature
        - Partial pressure of the gas
- Diffusion of gases
    - Occurs along a partial pressure gradient until the partial pressure is balanced
    - In the lungs: Gradient-dependent gas exchange between alveolar air and capillary blood across the blood-air barrier via diffusion → equalization of the respective alveolar and pulmonary arterial partial pressures
- Example: One places a bowl with 1 L of gas-free water in an air-filled room at 36°C and waits – how much O2 is subsequently in the water?
    - O2 partial pressure in the air: approx. 160 mmHg
    - O2 distributes itself in water until an equilibrium is reached – this amount in the water is then referred to as a partial pressure of 160 mmHg.
    - Now one can calculate how much O2 corresponds to these 160 mmHg in water.
        - Solubility coefficient of water for O2 at 36°C ≈ (0.025 mL/mmHg)/L
        - Partial pressure × solubility coefficient × liquid volume = 160 mmHg × 0.025 mL/mmHg/L × 1 L = 4 mL
    - Conclusion: In 1 L of water, approximately 4 mL of O2 is now dissolved. Since this amount is in a diffusion equilibrium with the 160 mmHg O2 in the air, it is said that the partial pressure in the water is now also 160 mmHg.

> [!NOTE]
> For the solubility of gases, the partial pressure as well as the solubility coefficient dependent on the solvent are responsible!

### Transport of Gases

- Forms of transport for gases in the blood
    - Physical Transport
        - Gases dissolve directly in a liquid.
            - The solubility of a gas in a liquid and its partial pressure determine how much gas dissolves, i.e., its concentration in solution.
    - Chemical Transport
        - Gases can be bound (e.g., to proteins).
            - Bound molecules can no longer diffuse freely.
            - Significantly larger quantities transportable
    - Conversion through chemical reaction
        - Gas is converted into a molecule or ion that is highly soluble for optimal transport.
        - Most important example: Reaction of CO2 to bicarbonate

###### Example Calculation

If one wants to double the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the blood of a patient suffering from oxygen deficiency from 50 mmHg/L, by how much must the partial pressure of oxygen in their inhaled air be increased? The solubility coefficient of water for O2 at 36°C ≈ (0.025 mL/mmHg)/L.

- Sought: Partial pressure of oxygen pO2 in the patient's breathing air
- Given: Oxygen concentration in the blood = 50 mmHg/L
- Concentration of the dissolved gas = Partial pressure of the gas × Solubility coefficient × Volume of the liquid
- Since the solubility coefficient for oxygen is always the same and the amount of blood remains constant, the doubling of the dissolved oxygen concentration can only occur through a doubling of the partial pressure of oxygen in the inhaled air:
- 50 mmHg/L = x × constant ⇔ 2 × (50 mmHg/L) = 2x × constant
- At an atmospheric oxygen level of 21%, which corresponds to 210 mL of oxygen per liter of air, this would be 42% = 420 mLO2/Lair.
## Oxygen Transport

### Type of Transport

Oxygen is needed everywhere in the body; however, physically dissolved oxygen can hardly meet the high demand - with hemoglobin, there exists a specialized transport protein for oxygen. Without hemoglobin, 1L of blood could only transport about 3ml of oxygen.

- Physical transport (<2%): Dissolved oxygen
    - Henry's Law: Concentration of the dissolved gas = Partial pressure of the gas × Solubility coefficient × Volume of the liquid
    - Example calculation for O2 at 37°C: Dissolved oxygen = 100 mmHg × 0.03 (mL/mmHg)/L × 1 L = 3 mL oxygen / L blood
- Chemical transport (>98%): Bound to hemoglobin
    - Each heme molecule can bind one O2 molecule → Max. four O2 molecules per hemoglobin molecule
        - Hüfner number: 1 g of hemoglobin binds up to 1.34 mL of oxygen
            - Example calculation: (150 g hemoglobin / liter of blood) × (1.34 mL oxygen / 1 g hemoglobin) ≈ 200 mL oxygen / liter of blood

> [!NOTE]
> The majority of oxygen transport occurs chemically through the hemoglobin of erythrocytes!

### Oxygen Binding by Hemoglobin

The binding of oxygen to the divalent iron ion of heme is referred to as oxygenation. Oxygen binds to Fe2+ ions of heme and simultaneously also non-covalently to a neighboring histidine residue in globin.

- Binding
    - Binding to the Fe2+ of the heme
        - No binding to Fe3+ (Methemoglobin)!
    - Stabilization through H-bonds with histidine residue in the globin
- Follow
    - Conformational change of hemoglobin → Transition from the tense to the relaxed state
    - No change in the valence of iron → reaction is reversible

> [!NOTE]
> The binding of O2 occurs to the Fe2+ of the heme without (!) electron uptake!

#### Tense (T) and Relaxed (R) State

The hemoglobin tetramer can exist in two conformations that differ in the arrangement of the chains relative to each other; these two states are referred to as the Tense (T) and Relaxed (R) states.

- Tense(T)-State
    - Low oxygen affinity
    - Stabilized by 2,3-BPG
    - Deoxygenated hemoglobin is predominantly in the T-state.
- Relaxed(R) state
    - Transition through binding of O2 → O2 affinity increases, remaining binding sites bind better

> [!NOTE]
> Hemoglobin can exist in a (T) or an (R) state, which differ in their spatial arrangement. The transition to the oxygen-affinity R state explains the sigmoidal shape of the oxygen binding curve and also allows for the regulation of oxygen affinity!

### Oxygen Affinity

The oxygen affinity describes how strongly hemoglobin "attracts" O2. It is not only important that O2 is well taken up in the lungs, but it also needs to be able to be released in the tissues. Therefore, the affinity cannot be arbitrarily high, but must be regulated. The mechanisms will be presented below.

- Cooperativity of oxygen binding
    - Definition: The more O2 bound to a hemoglobin molecule, the higher its O2 affinity will be.
    - Facilitates oxygen uptake in the lungs and release in the tissues
- Metabolic Regulation
    - Reduction of the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin by:
        - Decreased pH level
        - Increased CO2 partial pressure ("Bohr effect")
        - Elevated temperature
    - Opposite values increase oxygen affinity
- 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)
    - Function: Allows erythrocytes to decrease O2 affinity
    - Mechanism: A molecule 2,3-BPG can bind between the β-chains → O2 affinity↓
    - Production: Via a side path of glycolysis
- Globin chains
    - The different types of globin influence the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.
    - Embryonic/fetal hemoglobins contain γ, ε, and ζ chains → Higher oxygen affinity

> [!NOTE]
> Erythrocytes can regulate oxygen affinity through the amount of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) produced!

### Oxygen Binding Curve

The oxygen binding curve graphically represents the oxygen affinity: it shows how high the O2 saturation of hemoglobin is depending on the O2 partial pressure.

- Characteristics
    - Sigmoidal course (S-shaped)
        - Graphical correlate of cooperativity: As soon as some binding sites are occupied, the affinity increases significantly.
    - O2 partial pressure
        - Parameter: Indicates the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is half-saturated with oxygen.
        - Readable from the curve
        - Under normal conditions: O2 half-saturation pressure is about 24-33 mmHg
- Shift: Shows changes in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen
    - Right shift → Oxygen binding to hemoglobin weaker → Favored O2 release in tissues, impaired uptake in the lungs
        - O2 half-saturation pressure increased
        - Causes: 2,3-BPG↑, CO2↑, T↑, H+↑ (=pH↓)
    - Left shift → Stronger oxygen binding to hemoglobin → Lower O2 release in the tissues, improved uptake in the lungs
        - O2 partial pressure decreased
        - Causes: 2,3-BPG↓, CO2↓, T↓, H+↓ (=pH↑)
        - Hemoglobin from embryonic chains (γ, ε, ζ)

> [!NOTE]
> Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin just like oxygen does, but it has a significantly higher affinity for hemoglobin and can thus block O2 binding sites (e.g., in carbon monoxide poisoning). On the other hand, CO also has a cooperative effect on hemoglobin (for principle see: cooperativity of oxygen binding) and therefore reduces oxygen release in tissues – this means that when CO binds, the oxygen binding curve shifts to the left!

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to the S-shaped course of the oxygen binding curve of hemoglobin, the binding curve of skeletal muscle myoglobin is logarithmic, as no cooperative effect exists here! The sigmoidal binding curve of hemoglobin is characteristic of its cooperativity. In myoglobin, the oxygen-carrying molecule of skeletal muscle, there are no allosteric interactions: Therefore, the myoglobin binding curve is hyperbolic. Additionally, myoglobin has a higher oxygen affinity.

### Parameters of Oxygen Transport at a Glance

The various parameters of oxygen in the blood can be confusing - they are interconnected, but differ in their implications.

- Arterial oxygen partial pressure
    - Describes the physically dissolved oxygen in the blood
    - Main influence: lung function and O2 content of the air we breathe
    - Not sufficient for assessing the body's oxygen supply
- Arterial oxygen saturation
    - Describes the proportion of hemoglobin that is loaded with oxygen
    - Depends on the partial pressure and the O2 affinity of hemoglobin (see oxygen binding curve)
- Oxygen content in the blood
    - Describes the total amount of oxygen in the blood, including both the chemically bound and the physically dissolved amount.
        - So that the crucial parameter for the oxygen supply of the body
    - Unlike the other two parameters, it also depends on the hemoglobin content
        - Reduced hemoglobin levels decrease oxygen-binding capacity.

## Carbon Dioxide Transport

In addition to transporting oxygen to the tissues, red blood cells also ensure the transport of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs. This occurs in three different ways:

- Conversion to Bicarbonate (approx. 90%)
    - CO2 can react with carbonic acid to form bicarbonate: CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → HCO3− + H+
    - Reaction is catalyzed in erythrocytes by carbonic anhydrase.
    - HCO3− is practically unlimitedly soluble in plasma; CO2 transport mainly occurs through this pathway.
    - Hamburger Shift: Exchange of HCO3− for Cl– to release bicarbonate into the blood plasma
- Chemical (approx. 5%)
    - CO2 binds to the N-terminal α-amino group of the globin chains, not to the heme!
        - Four globin chains per hemoglobin, thus a maximum of four CO2 molecules per hemoglobin
    - Mechanism: Carbamate formation → Formation of carbaminohemoglobin
- Physical (approx. 5%)
    - Carbon dioxide can also physically dissolve in water.

> [!NOTE]
> CO2 is predominantly transported as bicarbonate; the conversion occurs in the erythrocytes. A hemoglobin molecule can bind 4 CO2 molecules. Unlike O2, however, CO2 does not bind to the heme, but to the N-terminal end of the globin chain!

> [!NOTE]
> In arterial blood, the total amount of all CO2 transport forms (CO2, bicarbonate, carbamate) clearly exceeds that of oxygen transport forms (O2 and O2-loaded hemoglobin). The total amount of oxygen in arterial blood is 200 mL/L of blood, while for carbon dioxide it is even 500 mL/L of blood!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Gas Transport in the Blood
### Oxygen Transport

What is referred to as the so-called Hüfner number? Give an exemplary calculation example for an adult man!
- The Hüfner number states that 1.34 mL of oxygen can be bound by 1 g of hemoglobin. The normal value of hemoglobin in an adult man is approximately 140–180 g/L of blood, so for example at 160 g/L × (1.34 mL oxygen / 1 g hemoglobin) ≈ 214 mL of oxygen can be bound per liter of blood (at an oxygen saturation of 100%).
How does the binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin molecule occur?
- Oxygen is attached to the divalent iron ion of the heme (= oxygenation) and stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the histidine residue in the globin. The valence of the iron ion remains unchanged. However, by binding the oxygen molecule, the conformation of hemoglobin changes: it transitions from the tense to the relaxed state.
Through which mechanisms can oxygen affinity be regulated? Describe these briefly!
- Oxygen affinity describes how strongly O2 is attracted by hemoglobin. It depends firstly on the present globin type, e.g., fetal hemoglobin contains globin chains with a higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin. Secondly, oxygen affinity can also be adjusted short-term according to metabolic activity and demand. Increased temperature, an acidic milieu, and an elevated CO2 partial pressure facilitate oxygen release (the opposite changes produce the opposite effect). Erythrocytes can produce increased amounts of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) via a side pathway of glycolysis when needed, which lowers O2 affinity by binding between the β-chains. Finally, the hemoglobin molecule itself can increase its oxygen affinity by switching from the (T)- to the (R)-state, i.e., binding one oxygen molecule facilitates the binding of further molecules and, conversely, other O2 molecules are released more easily when one is released (so-called cooperativity of oxygen binding). This facilitates oxygen uptake in the lungs and release in tissues.
What does the O2 half-saturation pressure refer to?
- The O2 half-saturation pressure indicates at which oxygen partial pressure hemoglobin is half saturated with oxygen. This parameter can be read from the oxygen dissociation curve and lies under normal conditions around 24–33 mmHg.
What is meant by a right shift of the O2 binding curve? What influence does this have on the O2 half-saturation pressure?
- A right shift of the oxygen dissociation curve means that the binding of O2 to hemoglobin is weaker (affinity decreases). This facilitates the release of O2 in the tissue and makes the uptake of O2 in the lungs more difficult. Consequently, a higher oxygen partial pressure is required to reach the same oxygen saturation – thus the O2 half-saturation pressure is increased.
What does the oxygen content in the blood primarily depend on?
- The oxygen content in the blood indicates the total amount of oxygen in the blood, i.e., both the chemically bound and physically dissolved quantities. This amount primarily depends on the hemoglobin concentration of the blood and the arterial oxygen saturation (= proportion of hemoglobin loaded with oxygen), since the majority of oxygen transport occurs chemically and physically dissolved oxygen is less significant.
What is the normal arterial oxygen saturation? What influence does anemia have on O2 saturation and O2 binding capacity?
- The O2 saturation indicates what percentage of hemoglobin is loaded with oxygen. Even in anemia, it lies within the normal range of about 92–96%. In contrast, the O2 binding capacity is reduced in anemia because less hemoglobin is available in the blood for oxygen transport.
What influence does carbon monoxide have on the oxygen binding curve?
- Carbon monoxide binds to the heme just like oxygen and thus blocks its binding sites. Moreover, it simultaneously has a cooperative effect on the oxygen binding of hemoglobin, which impairs oxygen release in the tissue. Consequently, the oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left.
### Carbon Dioxide Transport

In what way does the transport of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs occur? What role do erythrocytes and hemoglobin play in this process?
- The CO2 transport from the tissue to the lungs is mainly carried out by erythrocytes. The most important mechanism is the conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase in the erythrocytes, whereby about 90% of CO2 is transported as easily soluble HCO3− in the plasma. About 5% of CO2 is dissolved physically in plasma and about 5% is transported by chemical binding to the N-terminal α-amino group of the globin chains (CO2 thus does not occupy an O2 binding site).
Does the blood contain quantitatively more CO2 or more O2 when considering all possible transport forms?
- Even in arterial blood, the total amount of all CO2 transport forms clearly exceeds that of oxygen transport forms. The total amount of oxygen in arterial blood is 200 mL/L blood, whereas for carbon dioxide it is almost 500 mL/L blood.
