# Specific Immune System
## Summary

The nonspecific immune system is already present at birth and uses rapid, but less effective, defense mechanisms to kill pathogens. Therefore, a specific immune response is simultaneously initiated, which, however, takes hours and days to reach full effectiveness. At the center of this specific response are the so-called lymphocytes. Unlike the nonspecific immune system, lymphocytes use special receptors (B and T cell receptors) to recognize specific antigens of pathogens and target them accordingly. During the development of lymphocytes, each lymphocyte forms a receptor through a kind of random principle that binds only one very specific antigen.

When an antigen is presented to a lymphocyte via the MHC receptors of antigen-presenting cells, that lymphocyte proliferates (in the presence of additional stimulatory factors) in the secondary lymphatic organs to create a whole "army" of lymphocytes, whose receptors are specifically targeted against that one antigen. Since this process takes time, an effective specific immune response occurs only after a few days.

Lymphocytes are divided into so-called B and T lymphocytes: T lymphocytes can, on one hand, assist other immune system cells in the elimination of pathogens (T helper cells) and, on the other hand, directly kill virus-infected and malignant cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes). B lymphocytes, on the other hand, produce soluble antibodies that can either directly neutralize pathogens or assist cells of the nonspecific immune system in neutralization. Both T and B lymphocytes can develop an immunological memory to respond significantly faster to recurring infections.
## Antigen

Pathogens must be recognized by the specific immune system for combat. For this purpose, antibodies and lymphocyte receptors bind to specific molecules of the pathogens, known as antigens.

- Definition: Substances that can be bound by circulating antibodies or lymphocyte receptors and can trigger a specific immune response.
- Binding sites (= Epitope): Areas of antigens that are recognized by immune cells or antibodies.

### Classification

- Vollantigene: Can activate B or T lymphocytes by binding to their lymphocyte receptor and thus trigger a specific immune response.
- Hapten: Can bind to lymphocyte receptors and antibodies, but require another carrier molecule to trigger an immune response.
- Superantigen: Are capable of directly activating a large number of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, even if their T-cell receptors do not actually match the said antigen → Triggering of a "cytokine storm"
- Autoantigens: Body-own antigens that are recognized as foreign by the immune system through faulty (i.e., autoreactive) lymphocytes and trigger an immune response.
- Thymus-independent antigens: Antigens that can activate B-lymphocytes directly and without the help of T-lymphocytes (e.g., lipopolysaccharides)
## Cellular Mechanisms: Lymphocytes

### Overview of the Most Important Effector Cells and Their Functions

- T-Lymphocytes
    - CD4+ T helper cells
        - TH1 cells: Support the immune system, especially in combating intracellular pathogens.
        - TH2 cells: Support the immune system, especially in combating extracellular parasites.
    - CD8+ cytotoxic cells: Recognize and kill virus-infected or degenerate body cells through apoptosis.
- B-Lymphocytes
    - Plasma cells: Produce immunoglobulins to fend off pathogens (through opsonization, direct neutralization, and activation of the complement system)
## T-Lymphocytes: Overview

T-lymphocytes originate from the bone marrow and mature in the thymus into self-tolerant, naive T-cells. With the help of their T-cell receptors, they recognize antigens that are presented to them by antigen-presenting cells. Based on their surface proteins, they are divided into CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.

### Profile

- Synonym: T cells
- Size: 6–8 μm
- Origin and Development: Bone marrow, then maturation in the thymus to self-tolerant, naive T lymphocytes, which subsequently patrol through the blood and secondary lymphatic organs to "search" for suitable antigens (see also: lymphopoiesis, maturation of T lymphocytes)
- Morphology: Large, round, and chromatin-rich cell nucleus as well as a narrow cytoplasmic rim
- Antigen receptor: T cell receptor (= TCR)
    - Ligand: Specific Antigen
    - Receptor diversity: Is achieved analogously to B cell receptors or immunoglobulins through somatic recombination.
- Typical surface proteins: CD3 plus either CD4 or CD8
- Effector cells and their function
    - CD4+ T helper cells: Support B lymphocytes and cells of the nonspecific immune system in defending against specific groups of pathogens.
        - TH1 cells: Help in the defense against intracellular pathogens
        - TH2 cells: Help in the defense against extracellular parasites
    - CD8+-cytotoxic T cells: Can specifically kill virus-infected or malignant cells in the body upon recognizing an antigen.

> [!NOTE]
> The surface protein CD8 of cytotoxic T lymphocytes interacts with MHC-I receptors, whereas CD4 on T helper cells interacts with MHC-II receptors! (Mnemonic: The product of the respective numbers of the CD and MHC receptors always equals 8, since 4×2=8 and 8×1=8)

> [!NOTE] Differentiation of lymphomas
> Lymphomas are a group of malignant diseases that are characterized by a massive increase in lymphatic cells. For historical reasons, the large group of lymphomas is divided into so-called Hodgkin lymphomas and all others (so-called non-Hodgkin lymphomas). The group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas is further divided based on cellular origin into B- and T-cell lymphomas. For this purpose, the suspicious tissue is biopsied and subsequently stained with various immunohistochemical markers. A typical characteristic of a B-cell lymphoma is, for example, the B-cell surface protein CD20, whereas T-cell lymphomas tend to express T-cell-specific surface proteins such as CD3.

### Maturation of T Lymphocytes

The maturation of T lymphocytes occurs in the thymus. From the thymic cortex toward the thymic medulla, T lymphocytes undergo several stages of maturation. Maturation primarily includes the development and testing of an antigen-recognizing but self-tolerant T cell receptor as well as the development of the typical surface molecules CD4 or CD8. The maturation process is strictly controlled to prevent autoimmunity and results in the death of approximately 98% of immature T lymphocytes through apoptosis. The result is few but self-tolerant CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells.

|Reifestadium|Description|
|---|---|
|Stadium of "double negativity" (CD4-/ CD8‑)|- Migration: Immature T precursor cells migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus → Proliferation<br>    - Development of various T-cell markers<br>    - Surface proteins CD3, CD4, or CD8 as well as a functional T-cell receptor are still absent|
|Stadium of "double positivity" (CD4+/CD8+)|- Development of the surface molecules CD4 and CD8<br>- Formation of the T-cell receptor: Gene segments of the T-cell receptor are recombined (so-called somatic recombination), resulting in a functional T-cell receptor|
|- Testing of the T-cell receptor on:<br>    1. MHC receptors (positive selection)<br>        - T-lymphocyte interacts with thymic epithelial cells<br>        - If the T-cell receptor recognizes the presented MHC receptors, it survives; otherwise, the T-lymphocyte dies by apoptosis<br>    2. Self-antigens (negative selection)<br>        - T-lymphocyte interacts with antigen-presenting cells<br>        - If the T-cell receptor does not recognize the presented self-antigens, the T-cell survives; otherwise, it dies by apoptosis|
|Stadium of "simple positivity" (CD4+/CD8- or CD4-/CD8+)|- Adjustment of surface molecules: If the T-cell receptor interacts better with MHC-I receptors, a naive CD8+ T cell is formed; with a better interaction with MHC-II receptors, a naive CD4+ T helper cell develops.<br>- Migration: Naive T lymphocytes leave the thymus via the bloodstream.|
## T-Lymphocytes: Adaptive Immune Response

Professional antigen-presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) capture antigens in the body periphery, migrate to secondary lymphoid organs, and present them to “naive” T lymphocytes to prime them and stimulate proliferation. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells then directly target virus-infected or aberrant cells, while CD4+ T helper cells assist various other cells of the immune system in their function (e.g., follicular TFH cells help B lymphocytes differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells).

1. Circulation of T cells: T cells recirculate between the blood and the T cell zones of secondary lymphatic organs until their matching antigen is presented to them there.
2. Uptake of antigen by antigen-presenting cells
    - In the body periphery (especially through dendritic cells) → Migration to secondary lymphatic organs
    - In the secondary lymphatic organs, directly from the lymph flow or from the blood flow (spleen)
3. Antigen presentation: Dendritic cells in the secondary lymphatic organs present antigens to circulating naive T cells via MHC receptors.
4. Priming naive T cells: When an MHC/antigen complex encounters a matching T cell receptor, the T cell is activated and proliferates.
    - 1. Signal: Interaction between T cell receptor and MHC/antigen complex
    - 2. Signal: Interaction between CD28 of the T cell and B7 molecule of the dendritic cell
5. Proliferation: In order for activated T cells to proliferate massively (known as clonal expansion), they require additional chemical signals (e.g., autocrine IL-2 secretion).

- Differentiation to T Effector Cells: Proliferating T cells differentiate under cytokine stimulation into various CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells as well as T memory cells.

> [!NOTE]
> Since T cells can only interact with antigens that are presented via MHC receptors, they exert their effect only on the body's own cells!

## T-Lymphocytes: Subtypes

### CD4+ Effector Cells (= T Helper Cells)

Naive CD4+ T-helper cells are primed by the presentation of the appropriate antigen and differentiate into functionally distinct subtypes depending on the cytokines that act on them: TH1, TH2, TH17, TfH, and Treg cells. Since cytokines thus determine the "fate" of naive CD4+ T-helper cells, they are also referred to as "fate-specifying cytokines." As T-helper cells can also produce various cytokines depending on their subtype, they can influence the development of further naive CD4+ T cells.

#### TH1 Cells

- Main function: Support the immune system in combating intracellular pathogens that can survive within macrophages (e.g., certain viruses, protozoa, intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis)
- Most important produced cytokines: IFN-γ and IL-2
- Target cells and effects
    - B-lymphocytes: Promote the class switch of antibodies towards opsonizing IgG antibodies
    - Macrophages: Enhance antimicrobial capabilities to kill intracellularly persistent pathogens.
    - NK cells and cytotoxic T cells: Lyse infected cells or induce their apoptosis.

> [!NOTE] CD4+ cells as target cells of HIV
> In an infection with the HIV virus (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), all CD4+ body cells are affected. In particular, the CD4+ T-helper cells and the CD4+ monocytic cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells) are infected and subsequently destroyed. Due to a massive drop in the affected immune cells, there is a resulting immune deficiency with the risk of severe opportunistic infections, such as those caused by mycobacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which would otherwise be fought off by a healthy TH1 response.

#### TH2 Cells

- Main function: Support the immune system, especially in combating extracellular parasites (particularly helminths)
- Important produced cytokines: IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13
- Target cells and effects
    - B-lymphocytes: Promote the class switch of antibodies to "antiparasitic" IgE antibodies
    - Other target cells: mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils

#### TH17 Cells

- Main function: Support the immune system especially in combating extracellular bacteria and fungi
- Important produced cytokines: IL-17 and IL-22
- Target cells and effects
    - Neutrophil: Enhancement of antimicrobial capabilities
    - B-lymphocytes: Promote the class switch of antibodies towards opsonizing IgG antibodies
    - Epithelial: Production of antimicrobial substances is promoted.

#### TFH cells (follicular T cells)

- Main function: Regardless of the type of pathogens, they assist B lymphocytes in lymph follicles with affinity maturation and class switching of antibody production.
- Target cells: B lymphocytes

#### Treg cells (regulatory T cells)

- Main function: Regulate the remaining T cell subtypes by primarily preventing excessive reactions and thus autoimmunity.
- Important produced cytokines: IL-10, TGF-β
- Target cells: CD4+ T cells

### CD8+-Effector Cells (= cytotoxic T lymphocytes)

The CD8+ cytotoxic T cells that are primed and thus activated with the help of dendritic cells patrol the body and scan the body’s own cells for the matching antigen. If a body’s own virus-infected or degenerated cell is recognized in this way, the apoptosis of this cell is initiated – they are therefore referred to as cytotoxic T cells.

- Main function: Recognizing and killing virus-infected or degenerate body cells through apoptosis (= cytotoxic T-cell response)
- Induction of apoptosis by
    - Release of pro-apoptotic and cytotoxic substances (perforins and granzymes)
    - Direct activation of the "death receptor" (= Fas receptor)
## B-Lymphocytes: Overview

### Profile

- Synonym: B cells
- Size: 6–8 μm
- Origin and Development
    - They develop and mature in the bone marrow into self-tolerant naive B lymphocytes and are then released into the blood.
    - Wander into secondary lymphatic organs, are activated there, and begin antibody production as mature plasma cells (see also: lymphopoiesis)
- Morphology
    - Naive B-lymphocytes: Large, round, and chromatin-rich nucleus as well as a narrow cytoplasmic rim.
    - Mature B effector cell (= plasma cell): Nucleus with a so-called wheel spoke pattern and strongly basophilic cytoplasm
- Antigen receptor: B cell receptor (= BCR)
    - Ligand: Specific Antigen
    - Structure: Corresponds to a membrane-bound immunoglobulin
    - Receptor diversity: Arises similarly to antibody diversity primarily through somatic recombination (see also: Genetic foundations of the diversity of B cell receptors and antibodies)
- Typical surface protein: CD20
- Effector cells and their function: Plasma cells produce immunoglobulins (first IgM, then a so-called class switch to a specialized antibody form such as IgG)

> [!NOTE]
> B-lymphocytes can bind antigens without presentation, unlike T-lymphocytes!

### Maturation of B Lymphocytes

Immature B-lymphocytes originate in the bone marrow from lymphoid stem cells. They already possess an immature B-cell receptor, which is tested for auto-reactivity through positive and negative selection. B-cells that pass this test leave the bone marrow, migrate into secondary lymphatic organs, and differentiate there into mature naive B-cells. These circulate between the blood and secondary lymphatic organs until they encounter the appropriate antigen, develop into plasma cells, and commence antibody production.

> [!NOTE]
> Mature B lymphocytes express IgM and IgD as B cell receptors on their cell membrane!

## B-Lymphocytes: Adaptive Immune Response

Mature, naive B cells circulate between the blood and secondary lymphatic organs until they encounter their corresponding antigen, take it up, and present it to T cells activated by the same antigen. Together, they form so-called germinal centers in the secondary lymphatic organs, whose goal is to produce B cells with high-affinity B cell receptors through somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. These proliferate, leave the secondary lymphatic organs, and begin to produce high-affinity antibodies as plasma cells.

### Antigen Contact

1. Circulation of B cells: B cells recirculate between the blood and the secondary lymphatic organs until they encounter their matching antigen.
2. Detection of the antigen in 2 ways:
    - membrane-bound antigens: Dendritic cells and macrophages present antigen fragments to B cells on their surface, for example, via complement receptors.
    - soluble antigens: Direct recognition by B cells
3. Antigen uptake, processing, and presentation by B cells: Recognized antigens are taken up by the B cell, processed, and then presented via its own MHC-II receptor.
4. Migration to the edge of the primary follicle: In order to interact with an antigen-specific activated T-cell, the B-cell migrates from the center to the edge of the primary follicle, where the primary follicle (and its edge) borders the T-cell zones.
5. Interaction with the appropriate TFH cell
    - B cells present their processed antigen via MHC-II receptor at the border to the T cell zone until it is bound by the corresponding T cell receptor of a follicular TFH cell.
    - Activation of the B cell through interaction with co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40) of the corresponding T cell.
6. Division of the B cell population: A portion of the activated B cells forms a so-called primary focus, while another portion migrates to the center of the primary follicles and forms a so-called germinal center.
    - Formation of a primary focus: Through mutual stimulation, the appropriate B and T cells proliferate and in this way form the primary focus; as a result, IgM-producing plasmablasts arise, which, however, perish after some time.
    - Formation of a germinal center: B cells that migrate to the center of the primary follicle with their corresponding T cell proliferate there significantly and form a so-called germinal center.
### Formation of a Germ Center

- Definition: Accumulation, particularly of dividing B cells and some T cells specific to the same antigen, within a primary follicle. Once a germ center forms after antigen contact within a primary follicle, it is referred to as a secondary follicle.
- Function: Formation of B memory cells as well as antibody-producing plasma cells with high affinity and specificity for their antigen.
- Life cycle: Arises as part of an immune response and subsides a few weeks after combating the infection.
- Construction
    - Dark Zone
        - Zone, which is densely packed and darkly stained due to the strong proliferation of B cells (so-called centroblasts)
        - Here, somatic hypermutation takes place, followed by the migration of B-lymphocytes to the light zone (they are then called centrocytes).
    - Helle Zone
        - Less densely packed zone, where centrocytes mainly grow and divide less.
        - Here, in addition to B cells, there are many macrophages, follicular dendritic cells, and TFH cells.
        - Here, affinity maturation occurs through positive and negative selection.
    - Mantle zone: The light and dark zones of the germinal center are surrounded by the mantle zone, into which the resting B cells are displaced.

### Overview of the Germ Center Reaction

1. Mutation and Maturation: Generation of high-affinity antibodies through stepwise mutation and selection of B cells (see also: Genetic basis of the diversity of B cell receptors and antibodies)
    - Somatic hypermutations: Mutations in the genes of the variable parts of antibodies lead to new generations of B cells with slightly altered antibodies.
    - Affinity maturation: Only the B cells survive whose antibodies exhibit a higher affinity for the specific antigen after somatic hypermutation.
    - Class switching: Change of the heavy chain of the produced immunoglobulins through signals from follicular TFH cells, which leads to the switching of the immunoglobulin class from IgM to another immunoglobulin class.
2. Differentiation: Surviving mature B cells differentiate either into antibody-producing plasma cells or B memory cells.
3. Emigration: Plasma cells leave the secondary lymphatic organs via the lymphatic flow and settle where they are needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Seldom can the B lymphocyte directly transition to an activated state after internalizing its antigen (especially with polysaccharides) (T-cell-independent activation of B lymphocytes) and produce IgM!

## Immunological Memory

The first infection with a pathogen triggers a primary immune response, during which so-called memory cells are formed. If the body is attacked again by this pathogen, the memory cells can respond more quickly and effectively than naive lymphocytes and produce what is known as the secondary immune response. With each subsequent infection, new memory cells are formed that can respond more quickly, effectively, and specifically to the next infection.

- B-memory cells
    - Localization: Particularly in lymph nodes and the spleen
    - Skills
        - Your activation requires fewer antigens.
        - Can present antigens more effectively
        - Require less help from T cells to differentiate into high-antigen-specific plasma cells
- T memory cells
    - Localization: Various types are known that are present in both peripheral tissues, secondary lymphatic organs, and in the blood.
    - Skills
        - Your activation requires fewer antigens and co-stimulation.
        - Activation leads to a faster, more effective proliferation and differentiation into T effector cells.

> [!NOTE]
> Although memory cells are faster and more effective than naive lymphocytes, they still require contact with the appropriate antigen to be reactivated!

## Humoral Mechanisms: The Immunoglobulins

Just like pathogens, the soluble antibodies produced by mature plasma cells (= secreted immunoglobulins) can penetrate nearly all areas of the body. They bind to specific antigens (e.g., on the surface of pathogens) and are capable of either directly neutralizing them or assisting the nonspecific immune system in neutralization.

### Profile

- Definition: Proteins that are produced by plasma cells, dissolved in bodily fluids and secretions, and bind specific antigens to perform various functions in the defense against pathogens.
- General functions: Defense against pathogens through
    - Opsonization
    - Direct Neutralization
    - Activation of the complement cascade (especially the classical pathway) → cell lysis
- Basic structure: Y-shaped protein, consisting of two light chains (L-chains, approx. 25 kDa) and two heavy chains (H-chains, 53–75 kDa), which contain constant and variable domains.
- Domains
    - Constant (C) regions: Determine the antibody class (e.g., IgG or IgA)
    - Variable (V) regions: Form the antigen-binding part of the Fab fragments
- Fragmentation: Using papain and pepsin, these chains can be split into one or two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment.
    - Fc-Fragment (= Crystallizable Fragment): Is formed by the constant parts of the heavy chains (so-called CH domains) and binds other immune cells (e.g., macrophages)
    - Fab-Fragment (= Antigen-binding Fragment)
        - Is formed from two constant and two variable parts of the heavy and light chains.
- For each antibody monomer, there are two Fab fragments that can bind a total of two antigens.
- Covalent Bonds
    - Connection between light and heavy chain via disulfide bridges (i.e., between two cysteine molecules)
    - Connection between the Fc and Fab fragment of the heavy chain via the flexible so-called hinge region
- Secondary structure: In particular, β-sheet
- Classes: Classification based on the heavy chain into IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM
- Emergence of diversity: In particular, the "random" rearrangement of coding gene segments (so-called somatic recombination) leads to so-called "hypervariable regions" in antigen-binding Fab fragments of the heavy and light chains.

> [!NOTE] Monoclonal antibodies
> All antibodies that originate from a single B cell (or its cell clones) and target the same antigen are referred to as "monoclonal." If a single degenerated B cell clone proliferates massively, as in the case of so-called multiple myeloma, countless antibodies accumulate in the blood that can be used diagnostically. Monoclonal antibodies are also used in the laboratory, for example, to detect a specific antigen using immunohistology or Western blot techniques. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies can also be used therapeutically to influence a specific antigen, such as in tumor therapy (Rituximab against CD20 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia).

### Immunoglobulin Classes

In humans, five relevant classes of antibodies are distinguished based on structure, occurrence, significance, and clinical relevance.

#### IgA

- Structure: Monomer (blood) or dimer (secrets)
- Occurrence: Particularly in body fluids and on mucosal surfaces (produced by plasma cells of the lamina propria and transported to the epithelium through transcytosis)
- Meaning: Part of the first barrier against the intrusion of pathogens through epithelia
- Special Features: Breast milk compatible (nest protection)
- Clinical relevance
    - IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase in gluten-sensitive enteropathy
    - Selective IgA deficiency

#### IgD

- Structure: Monomer
- Meaning: The significance and clinical relevance of IgD is the subject of current research.

#### IgE

- Structure: Monomer
- Occurrence: Especially bound to mast cells located under the skin and mucous membranes (also along vessels)
- Meaning: Defense against parasites
- Clinical relevance: Allergic reactions may therefore be increased in patients with diseases from the atopic spectrum.

#### IgG

- Structure: Monomer
- Occurrence: Particularly in the blood (where the antibody is most concentrated) and on mature B cells as B cell receptor
- Meaning: Highly affine and specific antibody that is formed through class switching during an immune response (IgM→IgG)
- Special Features
    - Highest concentration in serum due to long lifespan → long-term immunity
    - Strong opsonization and weak complement activation
    - Placental passage (nest protection)
- Clinical relevance
    - Diagnosis of the course of infections (recent vs. older infection), e.g., Hepatitis B virus laboratory diagnostics
    - Rh incompatibility

#### IgM

- Structure: Largest antibody with approx. 970 kDa, exists as a pentamer.
- Occurrence: Predominantly in the blood (less so in secretions and the interstitium) and on B cells as the first B cell receptor.
- Meaning: First produced antibody with low affinity, before class switching occurs (indication of "fresh" infections)
- Special features: Strong complement activation due to its pentameric structure with a total of 10 antigen binding sites.
- Clinical relevance
    - Diagnosis of the course of infections (recent vs. older infection) e.g. Hepatitis B virus laboratory diagnostics
    - Blood group (ABO) antibodies

> [!NOTE] Vaccination
> To protect the organism from serious diseases, an antigen mix can be presented to it in a weakened live or killed form (so-called active vaccination), e.g., inactive surface proteins of the hepatitis B virus. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies so that in the event of a "real" infection, antibodies are already available and can be quickly reproduced before a dangerous infection occurs. In rarer cases, e.g., when an infection has already taken place, the appropriate antibodies can be injected directly (so-called passive vaccination). However, it is not strictly speaking a vaccination, as the body does not produce any antibodies or form memory cells itself. Thus, there is no long-term immunization.

> [!NOTE] mRNA vaccines
> The mRNA contained in these vaccines codes for proteins, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 for its spike protein, for example. After intramuscular injection, the muscle cells take up the mRNA, produce the respective protein, and release it, after which it reaches the regional lymph nodes. There, it is taken up by dendritic cells and broken down into peptides. These are presented by MHC-I CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which can recognize and kill virus-infected cells. On the other hand, they are presented by MHC-II CD4+ T cells, thereby supporting the antibody formation by B cells.

### Genetic Basis of the Diversity of B Cell Receptors and Antibodies

Since a single lymphocyte can only recognize a very specific antigen, the immune system produces an extreme variety of different lymphocytes in order to recognize and combat as many antigens as possible. This variety primarily concerns the antigen-binding, variable regions (V-domains) of antibodies or B cell receptors and T cell receptors, and it arises through various mechanisms: on one hand, there are several genetic building blocks (V, D & J) that code for the variable parts of the heavy and light chains of antibodies and B cell receptors and are combined differently during B cell maturation (so-called somatic recombination). On the other hand, the mature antibody genes are further modified (so-called somatic hypermutation).

- Structure of immunoglobulins and their corresponding gene segments
    - Immunoglobulins: Both heavy and light chains have variable regions (V domains) for antigen recognition and constant regions (C domains) that determine the antibody class.
    - Genetic building blocks of the variable regions: Variable segments (V) + Joining segments (J) + for heavy chains also so-called Diversity segments (D)
    - Genetic building blocks of the constant regions: Constant segments (C)
- Generation of diversity: Combination of the various genetic building blocks during the development of the B cell + combination of different variable regions of light and heavy chains + somatic hypermutations in light and heavy chains as part of an immune response.
    1. Combination of gene segments: VDJ recombination (= somatic recombination)
        - Different arrangements of the various variable segments (V) and diversity segments (D) to create the variable region of a light or heavy chain
        - Different arrangement of the connection segments (J) between V and D segments
    2. Combination of the variable regions of light and heavy chains
    3. Somatic Hypermutation: Rearrangement of the variable regions of the light and heavy chains as well as random point mutations.
- Class switching of antibodies (= isotype switch): Young B cells initially always produce IgM, but during the course of an immune response, they change the antibody class produced (e.g., to IgG) by altering the constant region of the antibody.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Specific Immune System
### Antigen

What is the difference between complete antigens and haptens?
- Antigens are substances that are bound by circulating antibodies or lymphocyte receptors and trigger a specific immune response. Complete antigens are those that can initiate an immune reaction solely by binding to B or T lymphocytes. Haptens can bind to receptors or antibodies but only cause an immune response when coupled to a larger carrier molecule.

### Cellular Mechanisms: Lymphocytes

What are the typical surface proteins of T lymphocytes and their subtypes?
- The Cluster of Differentiation (CD) nomenclature distinguishes cells based on their surface proteins. T lymphocytes typically carry the CD3 surface protein; additionally, CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells can be differentiated.
What is the function of the T-cell receptor?
- The T-cell receptor (TCR) is located on the surface of T lymphocytes. It has an antigen-binding site with which it recognizes specific antigens presented via MHC molecules. The binding of the TCR to the MHC/antigen complex is the first signal for T-cell activation within the immune response.
Which cytokines are typically secreted by TH1 and TH2 helper cells after their activation, and what effect do they have?
- Among CD4+ T helper cells, functionally different subtypes are distinguished, which develop depending on the cytokines acting on them. Activated TH1 helper cells secrete proinflammatory substances (especially IL-2 and IFN-γ), which stimulate the maturation of further TH1 cells and activate macrophages. TH2 helper cells combat extracellular pathogens (especially helminths) and produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These cause, among other effects, antibody class switching in B lymphocytes toward “antiparasitic” IgE antibodies.
Which cells are the target of the HIV virus (= Human Immunodeficiency Virus)?
- In an infection with the HIV virus, specific CD4+ body cells (especially T helper cells and CD4+ monocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells) are infected and destroyed. This leads to a massive weakening of the immune system.
Describe the processes from the first contact of the B cell with an antigen to its maturation into an antibody-producing plasma cell!
- B cells are antigen-presenting cells and carry MHC-II receptors on their surface. Mature naive B cells circulate between blood and secondary lymphatic organs until they encounter their specific antigen, take it up via the B-cell receptor, and present it via the MHC-II receptor. CD4+ T helper cells specifically recognize this presented antigen and bind to it with their T-cell receptor. Through the interaction of B cell and T helper cell, the B cell is activated, proliferates, and matures into a plasma cell that releases antibodies specific to the recognized antigen.

### Humoral Mechanisms: Immunoglobulins

Define antibodies!
- Antibodies are proteins produced by plasma cells, freely present in body fluids and secretions, and bind specific antigens as part of immune defense. Through this binding, they can either directly neutralize the antigen or support the nonspecific immune system in neutralization.
Describe the basic structure of antibodies! Which part determines the antibody class?
- Antibodies consist of two light and two heavy chains connected via a flexible so-called “hinge region” that forms a Y shape. Each chain has constant and variable domains, where the constant regions of the heavy chain determine the antibody class (e.g., IgG or IgA), and the variable regions form the specific antigen-binding part.
The immunoglobulins can be broken down into fragments through enzymatic cleavage. What do the resulting fragments consist of, and what is their function?
- Immunoglobulins can be cleaved enzymatically by papain and pepsin breaking peptide bonds into several fragments. The so-called “Fc fragment” (crystallizable fragment) is formed by the constant parts of the heavy chains and can bind and activate various components of the immune system (e.g., macrophages via their Fc receptor). The two so-called “Fab fragments” (antigen-binding fragments) are each formed from two constant and two variable parts of the heavy and light chains and can bind specific antigens.
The so-called "hypervariable regions" of immunoglobulins are located in the variable regions of the antibody molecules and they arise through processes such as somatic hypermutation and gene rearrangement.
- The hypervariable regions of antibodies lie in the variable domains of the Fab fragments and differ in light and heavy chains. This “hypervariability” arises during B-cell maturation in the bone marrow through “somatic recombination,” a “random” rearrangement of the encoding gene segments. Although the human body has only a limited number of genes for antibody synthesis, this process allows an extraordinarily large antibody diversity.
Which is the largest antibody and what special properties does it have?
- IgM antibodies exist as pentamers and thus are the largest antibodies with a total of ten antigen-binding sites. IgM is the first antibody released during an immune reaction, so an increased concentration in the blood indicates a fresh infection. They also form the antibodies of the ABO blood group system.
Which class of antibodies is typically found on mucosal surfaces? In what form do the antibodies exist?
- IgA antibodies are the typical antibodies on mucosal surfaces. They are secreted as dimers composed of two antibodies via transcytosis onto the epithelial surface—in blood, however, they exist as monomers.
Which is the antibody class with the highest concentration in the blood and what other characteristic does it have?
- IgG antibodies constitute the antibody class with the highest concentration in blood and are also the only class capable of crossing the placenta. IgG antibodies can thus be transferred from mother to fetus and are responsible in part for the so-called “nest protection.” They are produced during an immune reaction by antibody class switching from IgM and provide longer-term immunity due to their long half-life.
Which class of antibodies is involved in an allergic reaction?
- Mast cells can bind IgE antibodies on their surface. In an allergic reaction, an antigen (allergen) interacts with the membrane-bound antibody, triggering the release of mediators from the mast cell granules that serve to eliminate the pathogen. This leads to an allergic reaction, up to and including anaphylactic shock.
How is the hepatitis B vaccine composed?
- The hepatitis B vaccine is a subunit vaccine that contains recombinantly produced, inactive surface proteins of the hepatitis B virus (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)). This antigen promotes the formation of specific anti-HBs antibodies (active vaccination).
