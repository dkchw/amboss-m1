# Rectum and Anal Canal
## Summary

The rectum and anal canal are the last two sections of the colon and together form the so-called continence organ. The rectum approximately follows at the level of the sacrum from the sigmoid colon and transitions into the anal canal shortly after passing through the peritoneum. The rectum and anal canal have a special sphincter system made up of smooth and striated muscle that ensures continence and also defecation. From proximal to distal, the epithelium transitions from columnar epithelium to squamous epithelium.

### Structure

#### Rectum

The rectum (rectal canal) is about 12–18 cm long and follows the sigmoid colon. Shortly after it passes through the peritoneum, it transitions into the anal canal. Along its course, it is curved in both the sagittal and frontal planes, resulting in three mucosal folds in the frontal plane.

- Curvatures
    - Sagittal plane
        - First the ventrally concave sacral flexure
        - In the course, it bends caudodorsally: The ventrally convex perineal flexure is formed.
    - Frontal plane
        - Three bends (lateral flexures)
        - The bends create three transverse folds (Plicae transversae recti) on the mucous membrane.
            - The transverse fold of the rectum (Kohlrausch's fold) is the most developed and is visibly indicated from the outside by a distinct indentation.

> [!NOTE]
> Under the middle mucosal fold (Kohlrausch fold) lies the ampulla recti, which is normally empty. If it expands due to filling with stool, a feeling of urgency to defecate is triggered!

#### Anal Canal

The anal canal is about 3–4 cm long and extends out of the rectum at the end of the perineal flexure. The transition is visible as a wavy line on the mucosa (anorectal junction). The upper two-thirds of the anal canal are characterized by macroscopically visible longitudinal mucosal folds.

- First two thirds: 8–10 longitudinal mucosal folds (Columnae anales)
    - Crypts (anal sinuses) are formed by the mucosal folds, into whose base the proctodeal glands open.
    - In the area of the mucous membrane folds, there is a corpus cavernosum (Corpus cavernosum recti) in the wall of the anal canal.
    - M. anal canal: Covers and stabilizes as a continuation of the muscularis mucosae layer the corpus cavernosum of the rectum.
- Lower third: The approximately 1 cm wide zona alba (Pecten analis)
    - Firmly bonded with the substrate
    - Demarcation cranially: Dentate line (Pectinate line)
    - Delimitation caudally: Anocutaneous line
- Perianal Skin: Keratinized Squamous Epithelium

#### Anals Sphincter System

The rectum and the anal canal are surrounded by a complex sphincter system that ensures the closure of the rectum (continence).

#### Peritoneal Cavities

The transition from retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal position to extraperitoneal position along the course of the rectum and anal canal occurs due to the perineal flexure. This curvature also creates a so-called peritoneal recess in both females and males, which represents the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity.

- Female peritoneal cavity: Rectouterine excavation (Douglas space)
- Male peritoneal recess: Rectovesical excavation (Proust space)

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Superior rectal artery from the inferior mesenteric artery<br>- Middle rectal artery from the internal iliac artery<br>- Inferior rectal artery from the internal pudendal artery|
|Venous|- Superior rectal vein to inferior mesenteric vein<br>- Middle rectal vein to internal iliac vein<br>- Inferior rectal vein to internal iliac vein|
|Innervation|   |
|Somatosensory|- Pudendal nerve|
|Sympathetic|- Superior and inferior hypogastric plexus<br>- Lumbar and sacral splanchnic nerves (via the rectal plexuses)|
|Parasympathetic|- Pelvic splanchnic nerves (are relayed in the inferior hypogastric plexus)|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Internal iliac nodes<br>- Superior rectal nodes<br>- Superficial inguinal nodes|

> [!NOTE]
> In the case of a closure of the superior rectal artery, the remaining vessels can secure the blood supply; however, this does not apply to the erectile tissue!

> [!NOTE]
> The veins are interconnected through the venous plexus of the rectum!

> [!NOTE] Hemorrhoids
> If the corpus cavernosum recti is knottily expanded, it is referred to as hemorrhoids. The cause of this is venous drainage disorders, which lead to increased pressure in the corpus cavernosum recti. The drainage disorder can arise, for example, from chronic constipation, prolonged sitting, or a high anal sphincter tone. Predilection sites for the occurrence of hemorrhoids are typically the three terminal branches of the superior rectal artery, as the continuity of the rectal wall is interrupted there. Hemorrhoids only require treatment if symptoms such as itching, pain, or bleeding occur.

> [!NOTE] Circumvention of the first-pass effect
> The venous drainage of the rectum and anal canal has clinical relevance for the administration of medications. Orally administered drugs undergo first-pass metabolism when passing through the liver (first-pass effect), which can lead to reduced bioavailability. However, since the venous drainage from the tissue distal to the dentate line occurs via the middle and inferior rectal veins into the internal iliac vein, rectally administered medications can bypass the liver and the first-pass effect, reaching the systemic circulation (inferior vena cava) directly. Proximal to the dentate line, however, the venous outflow follows the route superior rectal vein → inferior mesenteric vein → hepatic portal vein. The hematogenous spread of metastases also occurs depending on the location of the primary tumor (proximal or distal to the dentate line) according to the different venous drainage (either into the internal iliac vein or the inferior mesenteric vein).

## Microscopic Anatomy

The rectum and anal canal exhibit a typical layering for the digestive tract in Tunica mucosa, Tela submucosa, Tunica muscularis, and Tunica adventitia (in retro- and extraperitoneal locations) or Tunica serosa (in intraperitoneal locations) (see overview of the digestive system). In contrast to the preceding sections, the typical characteristics of the large intestine (teniae, haustra, epiploic appendices) are not observed here. As a peculiarity compared to the rest of the digestive tract, the various sections of the rectum and anal canal display different types of epithelium.

### Epithelial Types of the Rectum and Anal Canal

|Section|Boundary|Type of Epithelium|
|---|---|---|
|Rectum|- Up to the anorectal junction|- Columnar epithelium|
|Anal canal|   |   |
|Zona columnaris|- Up to the dentate line (pectinate line)|- Alternating cylindrical epithelium and stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium (histological designation: transitional zone)|
|Pecten analis (White zone)|- Up to the anocutaneous line|- Stratified, non-keratinized squamous epithelium (histological designation: Squamous zone)|
|Skin zone| - No clearly defined boundary| - Stratified, keratinized squamous epithelium with sebaceous glands|
|Adjacent Skin|   |   |
|Perianal Skin|- No clearly defined border|- Keratinized squamous epithelium with stronger pigmentation and apocrine glands|

> [!NOTE]
> The zona columnaris is a histological transition zone (transition from columnar epithelium to squamous epithelium), which is why it is also called the zona transitionalis!

> [!NOTE] Serrated line in the clinic
> The Linea dentata is an important landmark in the anal canal. It represents the transition between the non-sensitive mucosa of the rectum and the highly sensitive stratified epithelium of the anal canal. Up to about 10 mm above the Linea dentata, there is a transition zone (Zona transitionalis), where the cylindrical epithelium of the rectum and the non-keratinized stratified epithelium of the anal canal are found alternately. Above the Linea dentata, there is also the superior hemorrhoidal plexus (syn. Corpus cavernosum recti) – an arteriovenous vascular cushion that aids in continence. If this plexus is enlarged, it leads to so-called hemorrhoids (see above).

## Function

The rectum and the anal canal serve the purpose of defecation (the expulsion of stool) and simultaneously also of continence. Taken together, these structures are referred to as the "continence organ."

#### Continence

Continence is ensured by the following mechanisms:

- Detrusor muscle of the internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter
- Pull of the M. puborectalis
- Filled erectile tissue (Corpus cavernosum recti)

#### Defecation

Process of defecation:

1. Dilation of the ampulla recti due to an invading column of stool
2. Stretch receptors trigger activation of the parasympathetic nervous system through cortical centers and activate the so-called continence organ.
3. Relaxation of the internal anal sphincter muscle
4. Spinal reflexes lead to a relaxation of the external anal sphincter muscle and the puborectalis muscle.
5. The corpora cavernosa empty through the relaxation of the muscles.
6. The sacral parasympathetic system triggers peristaltic contractions in the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.
7. Expulsion of the fecal column

> [!NOTE] Diarrhea
> Diarrhea (loose stools) is referred to when there are more than three bowel movements per day, a water content in the stool >75%, or a stool amount >200–250 g. In most cases, diarrhea is self-limiting and is only treated symptomatically (replenishing water and electrolytes). There are different forms of diarrhea with varying pathophysiologies: secretory diarrhea (increased secretion of water, e.g., due to food poisoning), exudative-inflammatory diarrhea (intestinal lesions, e.g., due to a chronic inflammatory bowel disease), hypermotile diarrhea (too rapid transit through the intestines, e.g., in irritable bowel syndrome), and osmotic diarrhea (substances in the intestine draw water osmotically from the tissue, function of laxatives).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Rectum and Anal Canal
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Which lymph nodes drain the lymph from the anal canal?
- The lymph of the canalis analis flows to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes, the internal iliac lymph nodes, and the superior rectal lymph nodes.

Hemorrhoids occur particularly frequently at so-called predilection sites. What causes this?
- Hemorrhoids are nodular expansions of the corpus cavernosum recti. Typical predilection sites are the three terminal branches of the superior rectal artery, as weak points arise there due to the interruption of the continuity of the rectal wall.

### Microscopic Anatomy

Name the three histological zones of the anal canal! What type of epithelium do they each have?
- The anal canal can be divided histologically into three layers: The cranially located zona columnaris is a transition zone in which columnar epithelium and squamous epithelium alternate; the zona alba consists of stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium; and the most caudally located zona cutanea exhibits stratified keratinized squamous epithelium.

### Function

Describe the process of defecation!
- The urge to defecate is triggered by the stretching of the ampulla recti caused by the incoming fecal bolus. Stretch receptors activate the sacral parasympathetic system, which on the one hand causes relaxation of the internal anal sphincter muscle and on the other hand triggers peristaltic contractions in the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. At the same time, spinal reflexes cause relaxation of the external anal sphincter muscles and puborectalis. The lowering of the tone of the continence muscles allows venous drainage from the corpus cavernosum recti (erectile tissue). The combination of these mechanisms ultimately leads to the expulsion of the fecal bolus.
