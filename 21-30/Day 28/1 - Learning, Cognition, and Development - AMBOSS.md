# Learning, Cognition, and Development
## Summary

In this chapter, the classical learning theories, the foundations of perception, memory and intelligence, as well as concepts of development and socialization in society are presented.

In terms of learning theories, behavior is largely learned throughout life. In particular, the theories of classical conditioning and operant conditioning are significant in this context.

Cognition refers to conscious and unconscious thought processes, including perception, evaluation, and memory. Additionally, intelligence plays an important role. It can be divided into different forms (e.g., verbal, linguistic, and emotional intelligence). These different components of intelligence can be assessed through various intelligence tests.

There are various theories regarding development and socialization in childhood. The theory of cognitive development according to Piaget as well as Kohlberg's stages of moral development will be presented below. The various parenting styles and the resulting attachment behavior also influence the development and socialization of the child and will be explained in the following sections. In adulthood, particularly professional stresses have an impact on personal development, which is why the model of gratification crises is of great importance.
## Learning Theories

In terms of learning theories, behavior is largely learned throughout life. Learning theories are of great importance in the therapy of mental disorders (e.g., in cognitive-behavioral therapy) (see also: psychotherapeutic methods).

### Learning Forms

- Associative Learning
    - Definition: A stimulus and a response are linked (associated) through timely or simultaneous presentation.
    - Examples
        - Classical Conditioning
        - Operant Conditioning
- Non-associative Learning
    - Definition: A reaction is influenced by the manner in which a stimulus is presented and by the environment with its stimuli; however, no connection is learned between these two components.
    - Examples
        - Habituation
        - Dishabituation
        - Sensitization
- Learning by Example
- Cognitive Learning
    - Definition: Knowledge is actively acquired through cognitive processes.
    - Examples
        - Learning through self-direction
        - Learning through Insight
## Conditioning

### Classical Conditioning

The classical conditioning is based on the fact that an unconditioned stimulus triggers an unconditioned response. This unconditioned stimulus can be paired with a neutral stimulus during a learning process, which subsequently also triggers the response and thus becomes a conditioned stimulus. When the response is triggered by the conditioned stimulus, it is also referred to as a conditioned response. The goal of classical conditioning is to establish stable expectations – for example, about where to find food.

Insb. the famous "Pavlov's dog" shaped classical conditioning. In these experiments, Ivan Pavlov was able to show that in dogs a known stimulus-response pattern (Food → Salivation) can be altered so that it is triggered by a stimulus that previously had no significance for the dog (Bell ringing → Salivation).

- The success of conditioning is, among other things, dependent on
    - Interstimulus interval: Time interval between the neutral and unconditioned stimulus
    - Order in which the unconditioned and the neutral stimulus are presented

> [!NOTE]
> As classical conditioning refers to the successful pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus!

#### Basic Concepts of Classical Conditioning

Some terms are used, with slightly different meanings, in both classical and operant conditioning (cf. Basic concepts of operant conditioning).

- Extinction is the deletion of a conditioned response (salivation) because the conditioned stimulus (bell) is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus (food scent).
- Reiz generalization: The conditioned response is also triggered by stimuli that are similar to the conditioned stimulus.
- Reiz discrimination: Recognizing differences between two stimuli
    - Discrimination learning: Learning process that enables the ability to distinguish between two stimuli.
- Higher-order conditioning: A previously conditioned stimulus is paired with a second neutral stimulus. This also leads to a response over time and thus also becomes a conditioned stimulus.

### Operant Conditioning

Operant conditioning is based on the phenomenon that rewards lead to an increase in behavior and punishments lead to a decrease in behavior. The contingency schema describes the possibilities for reinforcing or weakening a behavior.

| Model of Operant Conditioning (Contingency Schema) |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Unpleasant consequence of a behavior                                                                                               | - Direct punishment by adding an aversive stimulus (e.g., punishment, reprimand) → Decrease in behavior                                                                             | - Negative reinforcement by removing an aversive stimulus (e.g., lifting a ban) → Increase in behavior |

> [!NOTE]
> The so-called "negative reinforcement" may start with the term "negative," but it actually increases (!) the likelihood of a behavior because an unpleasant stimulus is removed! So remember: "reinforcement" always means that the behavior subsequently increases.

> [!NOTE]
> Operant conditioning refers to the successful association of a behavior with a reinforcement or punishment, so that there is an increase (with reinforcement) or decrease (with punishment) of the behavior!

#### Amplifier plans

- Continuous Reinforcement
    - The desired behavior is reinforced every time it is demonstrated.
    - Consequence: Behavior is learned particularly quickly.
- Intermittent Reinforcement
    - Forms
        - Quote Enhancement: Reinforcement of the desired behavior only every x-th time
        - Interval reinforcement: Reinforcement of desired behavior at specific time intervals
    - Consequence: Behavior is learned especially in the long term and is resistant to extinction.
- Premack Principle: A spontaneously frequently occurring behavior can serve as a reinforcement for a desired behavior when both are linked together.
- Token-System: For positive reinforcement of a desired behavior, initially worthless items (e.g., plastic coins or smiley stickers) are used, which can then be collected and later exchanged for the desired actual reinforcer (e.g., going to the movies).

> [!NOTE]
> To learn a behavior particularly quickly, while also ensuring it is retained in the long term, it is advisable to start with a continuous reinforcement and then transition to an intermittent reinforcement with variable ratio and interval reinforcement!

#### Basic Concepts of Operant Conditioning

Some terms are used, with slightly different meanings, in both operant and classical conditioning (cf. Basic concepts of classical conditioning).

- Extinction: The elimination of a conditioned behavior because it is no longer reinforced or punished.
- Reiz generalization: The learned behavior is transferred to another, similar situation.
- Discriminative stimuli: The learned behavior is displayed in specific situations.
    - Discriminative stimulus: A cue that signals a consequence for a behavior
    - Discrimination learning: Learning process that enables the display of a behavior only in the presence of a specific discriminative stimulus.
- Prompting: Additional support through external assistance (e.g., guiding the hand)
- Chaining: Step-by-step learning of complex behaviors by building a behavior chain
    - Backward Chaining: Practice and reinforcement of individual steps in their reverse order
    - Forward Chaining: Practice and reinforcement of individual steps in their chronological order
- Shaping: Behavior similar to the target behavior is reinforced in order to gradually achieve the target behavior.
- Primary reinforcers: Stimuli that satisfy basic innate needs or oppose their satisfaction. They act without prior learning processes.
- Secondary reinforcers: Stimuli that promote or strengthen the occurrence of certain behaviors only through temporal association with primary reinforcers.

> [!NOTE] Biofeedback
> Biofeedback is a therapeutic procedure aimed at bringing typically unconscious regulatory processes of the body (e.g., muscle tone) more under active control. For this purpose, these processes are measured and communicated to the patients in the form of certain signals (e.g., visually or acoustically). The learning process occurs through operant conditioning, where the acoustic or visual feedback acts as a secondary reinforcer.

> [!NOTE] Somatization Disorder  
> In the Somatoform Disorders category, individuals suffering from Somatization Disorder experience multiple, often fluctuating physical symptoms across all organ systems, without any discernible organic cause. Regarding the cause and maintenance of this condition, various explanatory approaches exist. One approach suggests that the perception of discomfort is maintained through negative and positive reinforcement. For example, if individuals receive increased attention (positive reinforcement) when they express complaints, this will lead to the behavior being exhibited more frequently (unconsciously) in the future. If individuals are frequently issued sick notes and do not have to go to work (negative reinforcement), this can also lead to the behavior occurring more frequently (unconsciously). This subjective experience of "positive" aspects of being ill is also referred to as secondary gain.

### The Two-Factor Model According to Mowrer

The two-factor model according to Mowrer expresses that a behavior or a psychological disorder is conditioned by both processes of classical and operant conditioning. These two types of learning are involved in the development of a disorder as follows.

- Classical Conditioning
    - Crucial for the emergence of the disturbance responsible
    - By linking an originally neutral stimulus with a negatively charged stimulus, a pathological reaction or pathological behavior is learned.
- Operant Conditioning
    - Significantly involved in maintaining the disturbance
    - By avoiding the negatively charged stimulus in terms of negative reinforcement, the learned behavior is maintained or even increases.
- Example: A student gives a presentation in front of his class (originally a neutral stimulus) and is laughed at by his classmates (negative stimulus). He links these two stimuli together and refuses to give presentations again in the future to avoid the hurtful behavior of his peers (negative reinforcement). As a result, he increasingly reinforces his avoidance behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> Both in classical and in operant conditioning, stimuli or responses are linked together. In the context of classical conditioning, various stimuli (e.g., bell ringing and the smell of food) are associated, while in the context of operant conditioning, a behavior and its consequence (e.g., behavior: cleaning the room and consequence: being allowed to watch TV → Positive reinforcement)!

## Non-associative Learning

In non-associative learning, a behavioral change occurs over time in response to a single stimulus. Unlike learning through conditioning, there is no connection made between different stimuli or a behavior and its consequence. Non-associative learning includes habituation, dishabituation, and sensitization.

- Habituation: The reaction to a stimulus decreases the more often the stimulus is presented.
    - Dishabituation: Presentation of a new, unfamiliar stimulus after habituation has occurred → Reaction to the original stimulus increases again
- Sensitization: After possibly repeated presentation of a stimulus at high intensity, the reaction to the stimulus increases, even when it is presented at low intensity.

> [!NOTE]
> In habituation, there is stimulus habituation, so the reaction to the stimulus (or similar stimuli) becomes weaker. In contrast, in sensitization, there is stimulus sensitization, so the reaction to the stimulus (or similar stimuli) becomes stronger!

## Other Forms of Learning

### Learning by Example

The learning by modeling (synonym: imitation learning, observational learning) refers, in contrast to classical or operant conditioning, to active learning processes that are characterized by the observation of role models (mother, father, friends, television characters, etc.). Complex behaviors are mimicked and learned by observing others. The more the observer identifies with the model, the greater the likelihood that they will adopt the behavior.

- Deputy reinforcement: In the context of learning by modeling, there is no direct reinforcement as in operant conditioning. It is sufficient if the observed model is reinforced for its action.
- The four phases of model learning
    - Attention phase: The individual focuses their attention on the model.
    - Retention phase: The individual stores what has been learned in their memory
    - Action phase (Reproduction phase): The individual performs what has been learned.
    - Motivation phase: The motivation to execute what has been learned increases as the model, and later the imitating individual, is more successful with their behavior.

> [!NOTE] Preparedness
> Some reactions and behaviors are biologically determined. For example, humans are naturally more afraid of certain things than others, which is referred to in learning theory as preparedness. For instance, there is a biological predisposition to develop a fear of darkness or spiders rather than of a rabbit.

### Cognitive Learning

#### Learning through Insight

In learning by insight, a person spontaneously arrives at a solution (Aha experience) without having previously experimented with various approaches through trial and error. This is achieved through pre-existing knowledge and experiences from past events. For example, a child might think and remember similar situations, leading directly to the idea of standing on a stool to reach their toy on the shelf.

#### Learning through self-regulation

In self-directed learning, behavior is less influenced by the environment. Rather, individuals influence their own behavior by setting personal goals and rewarding or punishing themselves for successful behavior. For example, a student might reward themselves after a successful day of studying by visiting friends.
## Cognition: Perception, Memory, and Intelligence

Under cognition, one understands conscious and unconscious thought processes such as perception, evaluation, interpretation, and memory. These processes mostly occur unconsciously and simultaneously.

### Perception

#### Unconscious Cognitive Processing Processes

When stimuli are so weak or short-lived that they are not consciously perceived, but rather unconsciously, they are referred to as subliminal stimuli.

- Subliminal stimulus (= Subliminal perception)
    - Large capacity: Within the scope of unconscious cognitive processing, many stimuli can be processed simultaneously.
    - Quick: The stimuli are quickly perceived and unconsciously processed cognitively.
    - Continuously: The unconscious cognitive processing activities occur uninterrupted.
    - Effortless: The unconscious cognitive processing occurs without cognitive effort.
    - Automatic: That is, also independent of "cognitive performance" (e.g., age, IQ)

#### Conscious cognitive processing processes (Executive functions)

Sog. Executive functions are applied when individuals are confronted with complex or new demands and their automated actions or thought and behavior patterns are no longer sufficient to process them.

- Executive functions include, among others,
    - Action planning
    - Action monitoring
    - Cognitive Flexibility
    - Partial functions of the working memory
    - Inhibition
- Executing executive functions requires attention and thus a high cognitive effort.
- Localization: In particular, frontal lobe

#### Relationship between stimulus intensity and sensation

The psychophysics examines the subjectively perceived strength in the perception of objectively different strengths of stimuli. In order for two stimulus strengths to be perceived as differing in intensity, they must exceed the so-called difference threshold. For example, two weights must differ by a certain amount in order to be perceived as differently heavy. As the weight increases, the absolute amount by which the weights must differ in order to exceed the difference threshold also increases – although the percentage increase remains constant. This relationship was formulated by Ernst Heinrich Weber in 1834 in a law.

- Weber's Law: States that the perceivable difference between two weights of different heaviness is in a constant ratio to the initial weight.
    - Formula: c = Δφ / φ
    - c = Weber constant, Δφ = difference between two weights, φ = initial weight
- Calculation example: In an experimental series on sense of weight, a person states that a weight must weigh at least 14 g to be perceived by them as "heavier than a weight of 10 g." According to the Weber-Fechner Law, how much would a weight less than 70 g need to weigh in order to be perceived by the person as "lighter than a weight of 70 g"?
    - Sought: Δφ2
    - Given: φ1 = 14 g, φ2 = 70 g
    - Formula: c = Δφ1 / φ1 = Δφ2 / φ2

1. Calculation of Δφ1
    - Δφ1 = 14 g - 10 g = 4 g
2. Calculation of c
    - c = Δφ1 / φ1 = 4 g / 14 g ≈ 0.29
3. Calculation of Δφ2
    - c = Δφ2 / φ2 ⇔ Δφ2 = c × φ2 = 0.29 × 70 g ≈ 20 g

- Interpretation: In the series of experiments, a weight must weigh at least 20 g less than 70 g in order to be perceived by the person as "lighter than a weight of 70 g."

### Memory

See: Memory

### Intelligence

As intelligence is referred to the ability to think rationally and abstractly and subsequently act purposefully. Different components of intelligence are distinguished (e.g., verbal and mathematical intelligence as well as problem-solving skills). Various intelligence tests are available to measure individual intelligence. The following presents different models and theories of intelligence as well as the most common intelligence tests.

> [!NOTE] Determination of the IQ value
> Intelligence tests such as the WAIS-IV refer to the average value in a comparison group (e.g., an age group). On the normally distributed IQ scale, the mean is defined as 100 points and a standard deviation as 15 points. Thus, an average intelligence is referred to when an IQ is between 85 and 115 points, which corresponds to a range of ± 1 standard deviation around the mean. According to the definition of a normal distribution, 68% of the values lie within this range. If the determined IQ value, for example, were to be two standard deviations above the mean of the population, it would need to be 130 points.
> Besides the IQ norm (mean 100, standard deviation 15), there are several other norm scales of psychological tests whose results can be converted into each other. For example, T-scores (T-scale) have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. A T-score of 70 corresponds to an IQ score of 130. Stanine scores (Stanine scale), on the other hand, have a limited range of values (1 to 9) with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2.

### Neuropsychological Changes

Disruptions in cognition can be reflected in neuropsychological changes. The following presents a series of such changes. The restoration of certain functions, for example through rehabilitative therapy, is referred to as (functional) restitution.

- Apraxia: Disturbance of the execution of voluntary, goal-directed movements despite intact motor function
    - Neuroanatomical correlate / Affected area: Depending on the type of apraxia, different regions of the language-dominant hemisphere (including language centers, primary motor cortex, motor association cortex)
- Agnosia: Disturbance of visual or auditory perception, without any basic deficits in sensory function.
    - Neuroanatomical correlate / Damaged area: Optical Agnosia: Lesion in the Striate area
- Prosopagnosia: Inability to recognize a familiar face
    - Neuroanatomical correlate / Damaged area: Fusiform gyrus (= Lateral temporooccipital gyrus)
- Alexie: A form of visual agnosia that leads to the loss of reading ability.
    - Neuroanatomical correlate / Damaged area: Depending on the type of alexia, different brain regions (mostly angular gyrus)
- Agraphia: Inability to write
    - Neuroanatomical correlate / Affected area: Various brain regions (including language centers, primary motor cortex)
- Perseveration: Words, actions, or thoughts are repeatedly repeated by the affected individual.
    - Neuroanatomical correlate / Affected area: Depending on the form of perseveration, different areas (mostly prefrontal cortex)
## Development and Socialization

Socialization refers to the lifelong process of an individual growing into society. The primary socialization (0–3 years) primarily occurs within the nuclear family, while starting at around the age of 3, friends and school (secondary socialization) as well as later the professional environment (tertiary socialization) gain importance.

### Development and Socialization in Childhood

There are various theories on development and socialization in childhood. It is now assumed that the interaction of biological-genetic factors and environmental factors significantly influences early childhood development. The following will introduce the theory of cognitive development according to Piaget as well as Kohlberg's stages of moral development. The various parenting styles and the resulting attachment behaviors also have an impact on the development and socialization of the child and will be explained in the following sections.

#### Cognitive Development According to Piaget

According to the epistemologist and developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, cognitive development occurs through the perception of impressions from the environment. One's own world and the environment are in exchange with each other and adapt to one another. In the course of development, the child goes through certain developmental stages in succession, in which (according to Piaget) two cognitive processes are crucial: assimilation and accommodation.

- Assimilation: New knowledge and new perceptions adapt to the current level of development.
- Accommodation: The current state of development (with its current schemas) adjusts to a new fact, thus being expanded.

|Stage Model according to Piaget|   |
|---|---|
|Stage|Important Characteristics|
|---|---|
|Stage of sensorimotor thinking<br><br>(0–2 years)|- Grasping the environment through the coordination of sensory and motor skills (touching, grasping, putting in the mouth, etc.)<br>- Learning object permanence: The child learns that an object still exists even when it cannot be perceived at that moment|
|Stage of Preoperational Thinking<br><br>(2–7 years)|- Lack of understanding of quantity conservation: When a liquid is poured from a wide container into a tall container in front of the child's eyes, the child thinks that there is now more liquid in the tall container<br>- Egocentrism: The child is not yet able to take the perspective of others. For example, they assume that everyone sees what they themselves are currently seeing<br>- Centering: The child is not yet able to focus on multiple things at the same time<br>- Ways of thinking<br>    - Animistic: All objects are perceived as alive<br>    - Finalistic: Nature exists to serve humans<br>    - Artificial: Everything on Earth was created by other humans or God|
|Stage of Concrete Operations<br><br>(7–11 years)|- Cognitive transformations become possible and the child can mentally play through content<br>    - Understanding of conservation of quantity: When a liquid is poured from a wide container into a tall container in front of the child's eyes, the child understands that only the shape has changed, not the amount of liquid<br>    - Reversibility: The child can imagine actions in reverse order|
|Stage of Formal Thinking<br><br>(approximately from the age of 12)|- Transfer of knowledge and operations to abstract questions is possible<br>- Hypothetical thinking becomes possible<br>- Phenomena such as "probability" and "chance" are incorporated into thinking|

#### Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development

Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development distinguishes between three different levels, each with two stages, depending on the justification for a judgment, which are traversed in the developmental process. In this process, a person's initially "selfish" thinking and acting increasingly evolves towards ethically differentiated thinking.

| Stages of Moral Development according to Kohlberg |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### Parenting Styles

| Parenting Styles according to Maccoby and Martin (1983) |                                                     |                                            |

| Support from Parents↓                                   | - Authoritarian Style: Exercise of Power, Rejection | - Neglectful Style: No Guidance, Rejection |

#### The Attachment Theory

According to the attachment theory, the social development of the child largely depends on the quality of its attachments to close caregivers. This attachment quality, in turn, is dependent on the amount of affection and stability that a child experiences, but also on its temperament.

- Stranger Situation Test: A child (12–24 months old) is repeatedly confronted with a strange environment, a stranger, and especially with the separation from their primary caregiver. Meanwhile, their behavior is observed.
    - Depending on behavior, four types of attachment are distinguished.
        - Secure attachment style: The child reacts to the separation from the attachment figure with sadness, but can be quickly comforted by that figure upon their return.
        - Avoidant attachment style: The child hardly reacts to the caregiver's return and shows little emotion.
        - Ambivalent-uncertain attachment style: The child reacts to the separation from the caregiver with pronounced sadness, but responds to the caregiver's return ambivalently.
        - Disorganized attachment style: The child responds to the caregiver's return with bizarre or stereotypical behavior and does not reciprocate the offer of contact.
            - Is additionally awarded if one of the first three reactions is not maintained.

#### Theory of Mind

- Definition: Cross-cultural ability to empathize with others and recognize the uniqueness of one's own self (self-awareness) and that of others, as well as their motivations for action.
- Develops in infancy and childhood

### Development and Socialization in the course of life

The development and socialization of a person does not end with the completion of childhood, but continues to take place throughout life. The following will briefly examine the influence of occupational stress on development and socialization (tertiary socialization).

#### Occupational Strains

Professional stresses to which individuals are increasingly exposed with advancing age can sometimes lead to psychological and physical illnesses. Both the Demand-Control Model and the model of Gratification Crises describe the circumstances under which stresses become more prevalent.

- Demand-Control Model: Primarily deals with stressors in the work environment of patients.
    - Job Strain: The higher the demands and the lower the possibility of influencing (controlling) these demands, the greater the stress for the affected individual.
- Model of reward crises according to Siegrist (1996): Reward crises occur when an individual is not adequately recognized for their work effort and performance.
    - Possible gratifications
        - Promotions
        - Job security
        - Appropriate salary
        - Praise and recognition from colleagues/superiors

> [!NOTE] Eating Disorders
> Eating disorders occur frequently in early adulthood and can arise, for example, as a reaction to interpersonal conflicts (both from the professional and private environment). Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-induced underweight (for example, through fasting or excessive exercise). In bulimia nervosa, binge eating attacks are predominant, and following weight gain, methods such as self-induced vomiting are employed to counteract it, resulting in the affected individuals usually being of normal weight.

#### Stages of Psychosocial Development according to Erikson

The stage model of psychosocial development according to Erikson contains eight phases that should be successfully navigated throughout a life and are influenced by social, biological, and psychological aspects. Each phase represents a kind of "crisis" at a specific time in life that should be successfully managed (e.g., autonomy vs. shame and doubt in the 2nd to 3rd year of life).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Learning, Cognition, and Development
### Conditioning

Describe the learning process of classical conditioning! Address the terms neutral stimulus, unconditioned stimulus, and conditioned stimulus!
- The model of classical conditioning associates a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus in a temporal relationship and couples them. An unconditioned stimulus is an innate stimulus that triggers a reaction independently of learning processes. In contrast, a neutral stimulus leads to a nonspecific reaction. Through a learning process, the primarily unconditioned stimulus is coupled to the neutral stimulus, i.e., the occurrence of the neutral stimulus triggers a specific, now conditioned response.

What is meant by stimulus generalization in classical conditioning? What is meant by stimulus discrimination?
- Stimulus generalization describes the phenomenon that a learned response can be triggered not only by the conditioned stimulus but also by stimuli that resemble the conditioned stimulus. Stimulus discrimination, on the other hand, means that similar stimuli are well distinguished and only the exact stimulus triggers the conditioned response.

What principles underlie operant conditioning?
- Operant conditioning is based on the phenomenon that reinforcements (positive reinforcement = pleasant consequence is added; negative reinforcement = unpleasant consequence is removed) lead to an increase in behavior, whereas punishments (direct punishment = unpleasant consequence is added; indirect punishment = pleasant consequence is removed) lead to a reduction of behavior.

What is meant by stimulus discrimination in operant conditioning?
- Stimulus discrimination in operant conditioning refers to when a particular behavior is shown only in selected situations (usually where it is rewarded).

Reinforcement can occur continuously or intermittently. What does each mean?
- Continuous reinforcement means that the desired behavior is reinforced every time it occurs. This leads to rapid learning of a behavior. If the behavior is rewarded after a defined time interval (interval reinforcement) or every x-th time (ratio reinforcement), it is called intermittent reinforcement. This serves the long-term learning of desired behavior. In learning theory, it is assumed that it is sensible to reinforce continuously at the beginning and then intermittently.

Explain the Token System!
- Tokens (Token Economy) are primarily worthless items used in operant conditioning, that are distributed immediately after showing desired behavior. They can be exchanged for something valuable once a certain number has been collected.

What is meant by Prompting?
- Prompting is a term in operant conditioning and describes support or external cues (e.g., guiding the hand) to help learn something new.

What do the terms Chaining and Shaping describe in operant conditioning?
- Chaining refers to the step-by-step learning of response chains. Backward chaining refers to learning in reverse order and is often equated with chaining in behavioral therapy. Forward chaining describes learning in chronological order. The learning of complex behavioral patterns by gradual approximation is called shaping (behavior shaping). The target behavior is approached through similar behaviors.

What is meant by extinction in operant or classical conditioning?
- In operant conditioning, extinction refers to when a previously reinforced behavior is no longer reinforced, causing the learned response to weaken and eventually disappear. Extinction in classical conditioning describes the weakening of a conditioned response through the absence of the unconditioned stimulus.

How can the maintenance of a somatoform disorder be explained through negative and positive reinforcement?
- Regarding the causes of somatization disorders, where affected individuals suffer from physical complaints without an organic correlate, there are various explanatory approaches. From the perspective of operant conditioning, the experience of complaints is maintained through negative and positive reinforcement, i.e., the absence of a negative consequence when avoiding an unpleasant situation (negative reinforcement) or attention given when expressing complaints (positive reinforcement) can lead to this behavior being shown more frequently (unconsciously) in the future.

### Non-associative Learning

What is meant by habituation and dishabituation?
- When the reaction to a presented stimulus becomes weaker the more often the stimulus is repeated, this is called habituation. If a different stimulus is presented in between, the reaction to the original stimulus increases again. This is called dishabituation.

What is meant by sensitization?
- When, after confrontation with a stimulus of strong intensity, the reaction to the stimulus rises above the previous level even when presented at low intensity, this is called sensitization.

### Other Forms of Learning

What is meant by learning by modeling?
- Learning by modeling refers to active learning processes that are observed in role models (parents, friends) and that have been rewarded in those models. Thus, complex behaviors can be imitated and learned solely through observation. The effect is greater the more the person can identify with the model.

How does reinforcement in model learning differ from that in operant conditioning?
- In learning by modeling, vicarious reinforcement through reward of the observed person is sufficient for the appearance of the desired behavior in the person themselves. In operant conditioning, reinforcement occurs directly with the person themselves.

What is meant by Preparedness?
- Preparedness in learning theory refers to the evolutionary tendency of humans to more readily develop fear of certain potential natural hazards (e.g., spiders, darkness) than of other things (e.g., electricity, vehicles).

### Cognition: Memory, Perception, and Intelligence

What is referred to as a subliminal stimulus?
- A stimulus that is so weak or brief that it is only perceived unconsciously is called a subliminal stimulus. Unconscious stimuli can nevertheless trigger physical reactions such as sweating or tachycardia.

What is the perception of subliminal stimuli also called? What are its characteristics?
- Subliminal perception (= remaining below the threshold) has a large capacity for simultaneously processed stimuli and can process them quickly, cognitively effortlessly, continuously, and automatically.

Which two intelligence factors does Spearman's Two-Factor Theory distinguish?
- According to Spearman, intelligence can be divided into general (g-factors), i.e., elementary information processing processes, and specific (s-factors) intelligence factors, i.e., special tasks and questions.

What is meant by crystallized and fluid intelligence?
- The model of intelligence forms according to Cattell distinguishes between fluid and crystallized intelligence. Crystallized intelligence describes solving tasks and problems by referring to previously acquired knowledge. It usually remains intact with age and is culturally dependent. In contrast, fluid intelligence, which does not need to be learned (e.g., flexibility, creativity), decreases with age and is culturally independent.

What is meant by apraxia?
- Apraxia refers to the impairment of executing voluntary motor skills despite preserved motor function.

What is referred to as agnosia?
- The disturbance of visual or auditory perception without elementary disturbances of sensation is called agnosia. A special form of visual agnosia is alexia, the loss of reading ability.

What neuropsychological change can occur with damage to the fusiform gyrus?
- If the fusiform gyrus (= lateral temporooccipital gyrus) is damaged, e.g., by a stroke, a special form of agnosia occurs: prosopagnosia, i.e., the inability to recognize familiar faces despite preserved vision.

What is meant by perseveration?
- With damage mainly of the prefrontal cortex, affected individuals may repetitively repeat actions, words, or thoughts in a loop-like manner.

### Development and Socialization

What are the stages of cognitive development according to Piaget and when do they occur?
- According to Piaget, there are four stages of cognitive development: 1st stage of sensorimotor thinking (0–2 years), 2nd stage of preoperational thinking (2–7 years), 3rd stage of concrete operations (7–11 years), 4th stage of formal thinking (approximately from 12 years of age).

What stages of moral development are there according to Kohlberg and how are they characterized?
- According to Kohlberg, there are three levels of moral development, each divided into two sub-stages: The preconventional moral level (before age 8) is divided into stage 1, in which morality is oriented to punishment and obedience, and stage 2, in which morality is oriented to one's own well-being. This is followed by the conventional moral level (early adolescence), divided into stage 3, where morality is oriented to the desire for recognition, and stage 4, where laws and rules guide moral orientation. Finally, the postconventional moral level (late adolescence) follows, divided into stage 5, where morality is oriented to the social contract, and stage 6, where orientation is guided by universal ethical principles.

What attachment styles can be distinguished after applying the Strange Situation Test?
- After applying the Strange Situation Test, four different attachment styles can be distinguished: the secure attachment style, the insecure-avoidant attachment style, the ambivalent-insecure attachment style, and the disorganized attachment style, which can be additionally assigned.

What is meant by Theory of Mind?
- Theory of Mind refers to the human ability to be aware that other people have their own thoughts, beliefs, desires, and intentions that may differ from one's own. It recognizes the uniqueness of one's own self and that of others as well as their motivation for actions.

What is meant by the Demand-Control Model and what is meant by the model of Gratification Crises?
- Both the Demand-Control Model and the model of Gratification Crises deal with the relationship between stress and health in the workplace. According to the Demand-Control Model, the risk of negative health effects is highest when high workload (e.g., time pressure, high work volume) is experienced alongside low control over task execution (low self-efficacy). The model of Gratification Crises states that an imbalance between effort at work and reward (gratification, e.g., in the form of promotions, job security, salary or praise/recognition) leads to stress and thus to health problems.
