# Chemical Reactions
## Summary

The transformation of one substance into another is called a "chemical reaction." It can be represented using a chemical equation that also allows for specifying the proportions in which the individual particles react with one another. For easier understanding, reactions are categorized based on their properties, which allows for predicting quite well what will happen when two substances are mixed together. Additionally, one can determine what amounts of a substance are needed for a reaction, what concentration a solution has, and much more.
Most chemical reactions are not "one-way streets"; they do not only proceed in one direction: Between a reaction (reactants are converted to products) and its reverse reaction (products are converted back to reactants), an equilibrium is established in a reaction mixture, which can be described by the so-called "law of mass action." Due to this equilibrium, the yield of chemical (forward) reactions is also reduced. If one still wants the reactants (the so-called substrates) to be completely converted into products, appropriate reaction conditions must be created, which can be determined using the "principle of Le Chatelier."

Finally, the "kinetics" of chemical reactions will also be discussed here, which provides statements about the speed at which chemical reactions occur.

## Ratios in Compounds and Reactions

Chemical compounds consist of various elements, as can be read under: Structure of Matter. In order to describe them correctly, it is important to capture the ratios of the individual components. This also applies to the chemical transformation of compounds, commonly referred to as "chemical reactions." Here too, there are fixed ratios in which the components of the reaction relate to each other.

### Molecular Formulas

Where the exact structure of molecules or large spatial structures like metals and salts is not important, a so-called empirical formula is used for simplified representation, which only indicates the number of atoms involved. The larger the number of atoms that make up a molecule, the more possibilities there are for how they can bond with each other. Therefore, it is not surprising that the empirical formula is no longer sufficient to clearly define which molecule is being referred to when it comes to large molecules. In this case, it is essential to represent the arrangement of the atoms using a so-called structural formula. The development of structural formulas is described in detail under: Representation of Molecules.

#### Rules for Developing Chemical Formulas

1. All involved elements are written down with their element symbols.
2. If an element occurs multiple times, its quantity is written as a subscript number after the element symbol.
3. Charges (type and number) are written in superscript behind the respective ion.
4. In large spatial structures, one considers the smallest possible ratio unit.
5. The order of elements is as follows:
    1. Cations are mentioned before anions.
    2. In organic compounds, the carbon atoms are named first, followed by the hydrogen atoms, and finally the other elements in alphabetical order.
6. Special rules for complexes:
    1. Square brackets enclose all elements that are part of the complex.
    2. Within the square brackets, round brackets are placed around all elements that belong to a ligand.
    3. If a ligand appears multiple times, the number is written as a subscript behind the round bracket around the ligand.

##### Examples

| Connection                      | Structural Formula | Molecular Formula |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Hydrogen molecule                |                | H2           |
| Water Molecule                  |                | H2O          |
| Sulfate Ion                       |                | SO42-        |
| Sodium chloride<br><br>(table salt) |                | NaCl         |
| Tetraamminecopper(II)           |                | Cu([NH3)4]2+ |

> [!note]
> Salts and metals look, at first glance, just like molecules in the empirical formula notation. It is therefore important to be aware that in practice, they are large spatial structures!

> [!note]
> The molecular formulas of organic molecules are often not unambiguous, as they cannot represent the bonding of the atoms to each other. For example, the molecular formula of glucose (C6H12O6) also represents over ten other different sugar molecules, including galactose, fructose, mannose, and inositol!

### Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions are transformations of substances in which new substances (products) are formed from starting materials (reactants). In principle, all substances (elements, molecules, ions, or radicals) can react with one another. They are represented using the so-called chemical equation:

#### The chemical equation

- Edukte: The substances from which something new is created; are always placed before the reaction arrow, usually on the left side of the chemical equation.
- Products: The substances that are newly created in a reaction; are always located behind the reaction arrow, usually to the right in the chemical equation.
- Reaction arrow
    - Connects reactants and products
    - The arrowhead indicates the direction of the reaction.
    - Multiple arrows in succession is a shorthand notation indicating that there are several reaction steps between the specified reactants and products.
        - Equilibrium arrow
            - Appearance: Two arrows pointing in opposite directions are stacked on top of each other "⇄"
            - Use: For a reaction that proceeds in both directions
        - Mesomeric arrow
            - Appearance: An arrow that has a point at both ends "↔︎"
            - Use: For the representation of resonance only!
        - Curved reaction arrows
            - Appearance: Curved arrows generally point in only one direction.
            - Use
                - For reaction sequences that result in a circular process (e.g. citric acid cycle)
                - To specify additional auxiliaries (=reactants) or/and by-products for a reaction step
                - To show how the electron density shifts during the reaction in organic reactions.
    - Labeling on reaction arrows
        - Reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pH value, etc.)
        - Reactants that are not mentioned on the reactant side (e.g. catalysts, acids, solvents, etc.)
        - By-products that are not mentioned on the product page (e.g. escaping gases, water, precipitating solids, etc.)
    - Balance Sheet
        - Charge balance: The total charge must be the same on both sides of the reaction arrow.
        - Mass balance: On both sides of the reaction arrow, the respective number of an atom type (i.e., its element symbol) must match.

#### Representation of a chemical equation

An example of a simple chemical equation is x A + y B ⇄ z C; this shorthand notation is read as follows: x particles of type A react with y particles of type B to form z particles of type C. A, B, and C represent any kind of particles (molecules, atoms, ions...); x, y, and z should be the smallest possible whole numbers.

- Structural formula notation: The involved particles (A, B, and C) are represented using Lewis structure formulas (see explanation → Lewis structure formula)
    - Use: Especially in organic reactions and when one wants to precisely illustrate how the electrons move during the reaction.
- Molecular formula notation: The involved particles (A, B, and C) are represented using a molecular formula (see above).
    - Use: Primarily suitable for inorganic reactions

> [!note]
> Since reaction equations are equations, it is important that the product side and the reactant side are actually balanced!

> [!note]
> Arrows and complex compounds: Sometimes, you find arrows within structural formulas for complexes. These do NOT indicate a reaction; rather, they are an outdated – and actually incorrect – representation of coordinate bonds!

#### Reaction Types

Reactions are classified according to the processes that occur during the material transformation. This classification is intended to provide assistance in highlighting commonalities between certain types of reactions.

The most important types of reactions (which will also be described in detail) are:

- Redox reactions: Transfer of electrons; Redox reactions are presented in detail under: Redox chemistry.
- Acid-base reactions: Transfer of protons; acid-base reactions are presented in detail under: Acid-base balance.
- Precipitation reactions: Reactions in which a component precipitates as an insoluble solid.
- Complex reactions: Reactions involving complexes
- Organic Reactions
    - Addition reactions: Reactions in which a molecule acquires a new functional group.
    - Elimination reactions: Reactions in which a molecule removes a functional group
    - Substitution reactions: Reactions in which a molecule replaces one functional group with another.

> [!note]
> A reaction can, under certain circumstances, fall into multiple of these categories!

### Stoichiometric Calculations

Through summation formulas and chemical equations, the quantities in which substances react with each other are specified precisely. This allows one to deduce the portions of substances or "amounts of substances" that must be combined when one wants to carry out a specific reaction. Such calculations are referred to as "stoichiometric" (Greek: stoicheion = basic substance, metron = measure). In order to avoid having to calculate with a large number of particles, the "mole" has been defined as the basic unit for this purpose. 1 mole corresponds to the number of C-atoms contained in 12g of carbon:

1 mol = 6 × 10^23 particles = NA (= Avogadro's constant)

> [!note]
> The mass of one mole of particles in grams is equal to the mass of the particle in units or daltons (1 u = 1 Da = 1/12 the mass of a carbon atom)!

#### Mathematical Consequences

With the help of the mole, calculations can now be easily performed. With the following equations, all stoichiometric questions can be answered, possibly through rearrangement and substitution.

- Amount of substance: n = N / NA
    - n = amount of substance in moles, N = number of existing particles, NA = number of particles in one mole
    - val (unit): The unit val is an outdated unit of amount of substance, but it is still frequently used in medicine. The amount of substance in moles can be converted to the amount of substance in val by multiplying it by its valence (the maximum number of singly bonded bonding partners).
- Molar Mass: M = m / n
    - Unit: g / mol
    - M = Molar mass, m = Mass in g, n = Amount of substance in mol
- Molar concentration: c = n / V
    - Unit: mol / L
    - c = concentration, n = amount of substance in moles, V = volume in L
    - Mass fraction: Instead of concentration, one can also specify the mass fraction, which is the quotient of a specific mass relative to the total mass.
        - For example, when mixing 0.9 g of sodium chloride with 99.1 g of water, one obtains a 0.9% saline solution.
    - Mixture of solutions of different concentrations: The concentration of the mixture is calculated as the sum of the products of the individual concentrations and their respective shares of the volume of the mixture.
        - For example, in a 1:1 mixture of two solutions with different concentrations: 0.5 × 2 mol/L + 0.5 × 5 mol/L = 1 mol/L + 2.5 mol/L = 3.5 mol/L
- Mass concentration: c = m / V
    - Unit: mg / L
    - c = concentration, m = mass of the dissolved substance in mg or less commonly g, V = volume in L

##### Example Calculation 1 – Calculation of Concentration

A liter of saline solution is prepared with a ratio of 10 g of NaCl to 100 mL of water. The molar mass of sodium chloride is 60 g/mol. Now, this liter of solution is diluted with 4 L of water. What is the concentration of the diluted solution?

- Sought: concentration c
- Given: Volume of the solution V, mass of the dissolved substance m, molar mass of the dissolved substance M
    - For 1 L 10 × 100 mL, 100 g of table salt must be calculated here.
    - M = m / n ⇔ n = m / M => nNaCl = 100 g / 60 g/mol = 1.7 mol
    - c = n / V => in 1 L of this liquid, there are thus 100 g of NaCl present => cNaCl = 1.7 mol/L
    - If the liquid is diluted, then there are 1.7 mol in 5 L => cNaCl = n / V = 1.7 mol / 5 L = 0.34 mol/L

##### Example Calculation 2 – Calculation of the Amount of Substance

How do you determine the amount of substance in a 3 g heavy cube of sugar (= glucose)?

- Sought: Amount of substance n
- Given: Mass m
    - The molecule glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6
    - 1 mole of the glucose molecule therefore contains 6 moles of carbon atoms, 12 moles of hydrogen atoms, and 6 moles of oxygen atoms.
    - The relative mass of glucose is 6 × 12 u (for carbon) + 12 × 1 u (for hydrogen) + 6 × 16 u (for oxygen) = 180 u
    - The mass of 1 mole of glucose is equal to the relative mass of the molecule in g => 1 mole of glucose weighs 180 g
    - Since the mass m of the portion of glucose is only 3 g, one can calculate: M = m / n ⇔ n = m / M => n = 3 g / 180 g = 0.017 mol

##### Example Calculation 3 – Calculation of Reaction Components

Glucose reacts according to the following chemical equation with oxygen:

C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

How many moles of oxygen (O2) are needed to react with 90 g of glucose?

- Sought: Amount of substance n depending on the stoichiometry of the reaction
- Given: Stoichiometry of the reaction (1:6), mass m
    - M (the molar mass) of glucose = 180 g/mol (see example 2) => 90 g glucose ≅ 0.5 mol = n
    - Glucose and oxygen react with each other in a ratio of 1:6, i.e. nO2 = 6 × nGlucose = 3 mol

##### Example Calculation 4 – Calculation of a Mass Fraction

How much grams of nitrogen are in 30 grams of urea?

- Sought: mass m as a function of the quantity ratios in a summation formula
- Given: Mass m
    - Urea has the molecular formula CH4N2O, so 2 nitrogen atoms are needed per urea molecule; therefore, 1 mole of urea contains 2 moles of N atoms.
    - MHarnstoff= 1 × 12 u + 4 × 1 u + 2 × 14 u + 1 × 16 u = 60 g/mol
    - M = m / n ⇔ n = m / M; thus, there are n = m / M = 30 g / 60 g/mol = 0.5 mol of urea present.
    - In the 0.5 mol of urea, there are 1 mol of nitrogen atoms.
    - The molar mass of nitrogen is 14 g/mol. Therefore, the mole of nitrogen atoms contained in urea weighs 14 g. In other words: Out of 30 g of urea, 14 g is attributed to nitrogen.

## Reaction Equilibria

The chemical equation A + B → C + D is almost always a simplification of the actual situation at hand. Once the reaction begins, you have a mixture of A, B, C, and D in a reaction vessel, so the so-called reverse reaction, that is C + D → A + B, can also occur, even if it happens much less frequently. Such a reversible reaction is also referred to as reversible. This is known as the chemical equilibrium of a reaction, which is denoted by the so-called equilibrium arrow (⇄): A + B ⇄ C + D.

### Law of Mass Action

In what relation the reaction and its reverse reaction stand to each other (that is, whether one occurs significantly more often than the other or whether both happen with similar frequency and speed) can be mathematically expressed through the equilibrium constant of the reaction:

- Law of Mass Action: For a reaction a A + b B ⇄ c C + d D, it holds that: K = (cC × dD) / (aA × bB)
    - K = equilibrium constant, c(C) = concentration of substance C, c(D) = concentration of substance D, c(A) = concentration of substance A, c(B) = concentration of substance B; a, b, c, d = stoichiometric coefficients
    - Important facts about the equilibrium constant K
        - K >1: The reaction equilibrium lies on the side of the products (the forward reaction predominates)
        - K <1: The reaction equilibrium lies on the side of the reactants (the reverse reaction predominates)
        - Kinetics: The equilibrium constant K is also used to describe the kinetics of a reaction (see below)
        - Enzyme kinetics: In enzymatic reactions, further statements can be made from the equilibrium constant of a reaction and its change, e.g., about the effectiveness of an enzyme and existing inhibition mechanisms. For details, see: Enzymes and Biocatalysis

##### Example Calculation

For the reaction Fe2O3 + 3 CO ⇄ 2 Fe + 3 CO2, it holds that c(Fe2O3) = 0.001 mol/L; c(CO) = 0.1 mol/L; c(Fe) = 0.05 mol/L, c(CO2) = 0.03 mol/L. Calculate the equilibrium constant.

- Sought: Equilibrium constant K
- Given: Molecular formula of the reaction, concentrations c
    - → For this reaction, the law of mass action applies: K = (c3(CO2) × c2(Fe)) / (c(Fe2O3) × c3(CO))
    - → (0.033 × 0.052) / (0.001 × 0.13) = 0.0675
    - From the equilibrium constant k = 0.0675, it can be inferred that under the given conditions, the reduction of iron oxide to iron does not proceed to completion and, since K < 1, the reverse reaction (Fe → Fe2O3) is favored under these conditions.

### Solubility

The maximum amount of a substance that can "dissolve" is described, analogous to a chemical reaction, by an equilibrium. For this equilibrium, the law of mass action can also be established, which in this special case is referred to as the "solubility product." If the solubility of a substance is exceeded, a solid precipitate forms. Polar substances dissolve well in polar solvents (e.g., salts in water), but not in non-polar solvents. Non-polar substances dissolve poorly in polar solvents (e.g., oil in water), but well in non-polar solvents.

- "Reaction equation" for the dissolution of a substance AB in a solvent: x AB(solid) ⇄ y A+(dissolved) + z B-(dissolved)
    - Solubility product: KL = cy(A+(dissolved)) × cz(B-(dissolved))
        - Unit: Varies depending on the number of ions involved – for each ion, the factor mol/L is added once
        - KL = equilibrium constant for the dissolution process, c = concentrations, x, y, z = stoichiometric factors
    - Solubility: The product of the concentrations of the dissolved ions indicates how well a substance can be dissolved.
        - KL large = good solubility
        - KL small = poor solubility
    - Energy change during dissolution processes
        - Exothermic: Solubility process releases energy
            - Mixture heats up
        - Endotherm: The process of solution requires energy
            - Mixture cools down

> [!note]
> Like dissolves like!

> [!note]
> The solubility product described above also applies to the ions H+ (or H3O+) and OH-, which determine the pH value of a solution. See: Chemical Fundamentals of Acids and Bases!

> [!note] Barium
> A poisoning with barium salts can lead to severe symptoms such as paralysis, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular problems, and convulsions, or even death. In acute cases, it can be treated with the oral administration of Na2SO4 (Glauber's salt). This results in the formation of insoluble BaSO4, which is excreted through the stool. Since barium sulfate is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and has no intrinsic effect, it is also suitable as a contrast medium in radiological examinations such as the esophageal barium swallow or the colon double-contrast enema.

#### Example Calculation

The solubility product of barium sulfate is KL = 1×10-9 mol2/L2. What is the maximum concentration of barium ions in a sulfate solution?

- Sought: c(Ba2+)
- Given: Solubility product KL(BaSO4)
    - The equation for the dissolution process of barium sulfate is: BaSO4(solid) ⇄ Ba2+ (aqueous) + SO42- (aqueous)
    - The solubility product indicates the maximum solubility of a solid and is calculated as KL = c(Ba2+) × c(SO42-)
    - Since the concentrations of both ions are equal c(Ba2+) = c(SO42-) it follows for the maximum concentration of barium ions √KL = c(Ba2+) = √(1×10-9mol2/L2) = 0.00003 mol/L

### Determination and Influence of Equilibrium Positions

The position of a reaction equilibrium corresponds to the ratio of the forward and reverse reactions and can therefore be described by the ratio of products to reactants (i.e., through the law of mass action) (see above). However, the position of a reaction equilibrium can also be actively influenced if one knows the right parameters for the reaction. This is described by the so-called Le Chatelier's principle, the "principle of least constraint."

Definition: If a constraint is applied to a chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium shifts in such a way that the constraint is alleviated.

| From Le Chatelier's principle, the following consequences arise for chemical reactions: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                              |                                                                               |

## Selected Reaction Types

Redox reactions and acid-base reactions are, as already mentioned, particularly fundamental categories of chemical reactions. They are therefore described separately under: redox chemistry and: acid-base balance. Here follows an overview of various other possibilities for classifying reactions. These classifications are often made according to specific reacting substance groups or common reaction pathways. The following will briefly describe only the most relevant types of reactions.

### Precipitation Reaction

This includes all reactions in which a solid forms during the process, which – due to its low solubility – immediately precipitates as a sediment (see above). The special feature of precipitation reactions is that the precipitated substance is removed from the reaction equilibrium (depending on the solubility of the substance, possibly even almost completely). This causes the reaction equilibrium to shift strongly toward the side of the products.

### Complex Reaction

This includes all reactions involving complexes. Since this is a very general classification, complex reactions are further divided into two different processes.

- Complex formation
    - Definition: A reaction in which ligands form around a central particle and connect through a complex bond.
    - Example: Fe2+ + 6 H2O ⇄ [Fe(H2O)6]2+
    - Chelate effect: Ligands with multiple binding sites (so-called multidentate ligands) bind more quickly to the central atom with their additional binding sites after the first binding than separate ligands.
- Ligand exchange reaction
    - Definition: A reaction in which a weakly binding ligand in a complex is replaced by a more strongly binding ligand.
    - Example: [Fe(H2O)6]2+ + 6 CN- ⇄ [Fe(CN)6]4- + 6 H2O

### Hydrolyze

The category of hydrolysis includes all reactions in which a molecule is split by a water molecule.

- General reaction equation: A-B + H2O ⇄ A-OH + B-H
- Important examples
    - Ester hydrolysis: R1-COO-R2 + H2O ⇄ R1COOH + R2-OH
        - Fatty acid hydrolysis: Triglyceride + 3 H2O ⇄ Glycerol + 3 Fatty acid
    - ATP Hydrolysis: ATP4− + H2O → ADP3− + HPO42− + H+
    - Polysaccharide Hydrolysis: Sucrose + H2O ⇄ Glucose + Fructose
    - Protein Hydrolysis

### Fundamental Reactions in Organic Chemistry

In organic chemistry, there are hundreds of reactions that are also called "named reactions" because the researcher who discovered them usually names them after themselves. These reactions are almost exclusively special cases, and for non-chemists, it is hardly worth knowing them. However, there are four overarching principles for classifying reactions in organic chemistry, namely the division into additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.

- Addition reaction
    - Definition: This includes all reactions in which two molecules, one of which has at least one multiple bond, combine.
    - Reaction equation
        - Example: Hydration, a reaction in which a water molecule adds to a double bond, resulting in the formation of an alcohol.
- Elimination reaction
    - Definition: This includes all reactions in which individual atoms or even an entire part of the molecule are cleaved from a molecule.
    - Reaction equation: R-C-C-A ⇄ R-C=C + A
        - Example: Dehydration, a reaction in which a water molecule is removed and a double bond is formed
- Substitution reaction
    - Definition: This includes all reactions in which an atom or an entire group of atoms in a molecule is replaced by another.
    - Reaction equation: A + R-B ⇄ A-R + B
- Rearrangement reaction
    - Definition: This includes all reactions in which the linkage of atom groups within a molecule is altered.
        - Example: Constitutional isomers such as Dihydroxyacetone phosphate and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in Phase 2 of glycolysis

## Kinetics of Chemical Reactions

Kinetics deals with the rate of chemical reactions or physical transport processes. It is, along with thermodynamics, the second important criterion for whether a process occurs or not.

- Collision theory: States that the rate of a reaction depends on the collisions of the molecules in the reaction mixture.
- Criteria for the progression of a reaction
    - Concentration: The greater the concentration of the reacting substances, the more likely the molecules will collide, and the faster the reaction.
    - Energy: Colliding particles require a minimum energy for the collision to result in a reaction.
    - Spatial orientation: Particles must collide with a specific spatial orientation for the collision to lead to a reaction.

### Activation Energy

The Arrhenius equation expresses the rate constant of a reaction as a function of the activation energy of that reaction and the ambient temperature, which serves as the heat reservoir for the reaction.

Formula: k = A × e (-E / R × T)

- k = reaction rate constant, A = pre-factor, E = activation energy, R = gas constant, T = temperature
- A very high activation energy in the exponent causes the exponential factor and thus the reaction rate constant k to approach zero.
- A higher ambient temperature in the denominator of the exponent increases the exponential factor and thus k.

### Reaction Rate

The reaction rate is mathematically the derivative of the concentration of a reactant with respect to time.

Formula: v = dc / dt

- v = reaction rate, dc = change in reactant concentration, dt = change in time
- Half-life (t1/2): Corresponds to the time in which exactly half of the mixture has reacted.
    - In a concentration (time) diagram, the value for t½ can be read directly at ½cmax.

> The speed at which a reaction occurs has nothing to do with the energetics (i.e., the thermodynamics) of the reaction!

### Reaction Order

Since the speed of a reaction is related to how often the particles in the reaction mixture collide, it also depends on how many particles must collide for the reaction to occur. This consideration leads to a classification of reactions based on the so-called reaction order:

- Zero-order reaction: The reaction rate v does not depend on the concentration of the reactants or products.
    - Formula: v = k
        - v = reaction rate, k = rate constant
    - General reaction equation: A → B
    - Example: Light-dependent reactions
- First-order reaction: The reaction rate v depends on the concentration of one of the substances involved.
    - Formula: v = k × c(A)
        - v = reaction rate, k = rate constant, c(A) = concentration of substance A
    - General reaction equation: A → B + C
    - Examples: Catalytic reactions, radioactive decay
    - Half-life: Independent of the concentration of the reactants
        - Reaction course: After t½, 50% of the reactants are still present; after 2t½, 25% of the reactants are still present; after 3t½, 12.5% are still present, and so on.
- Second-order reaction: The reaction rate v depends on the concentration of two reactants.
    - Formula: v = k × c(A) × c(B)
        - v = reaction rate, k = rate constant, c(A) = concentration of substance A, c(B) = concentration of substance B
    - General reaction equation: A + B → C
    - Examples: Most reactions between two molecules in solution proceed like this.
- Reaction of the 3rd order: The reaction rate v depends on the concentration of three involved substances.
    - Formula: v = k × c(A) × c(B) × c(C)
        - v = reaction rate, k = rate constant, c(A) = concentration of substance A, c(B) = concentration of substance B, c(C) = concentration of substance C
    - General reaction equation: A + B + C → D
    - Example: These reactions almost never occur in this form, as it is very unlikely that three particles will collide simultaneously.

### Coupled Reactions

Reactions involving multiple components typically occur in practice through several consecutive elementary steps, known as elementary reactions. This results in a chain of reactions that are all interrelated. Such reactions are also referred to as coupled. Various scenarios are conceivable, including:

- A → B → C
    - Irreversible processes that occur sequentially
    - Rate constant k1 for the reaction A to B and k2 for the reaction B to C
    - Law of mass action: k = c(Products) / c(Reactants)
    - Calculation: ktotal = c(C) / c(A) = c(B) / c(A) × c(C) / c(B) = k1 × k2
- A ⇄ B
    - Reversible process in which the forward and reverse reactions are in equilibrium
    - Rate constants k1 for the forward reaction and k-1 for the reverse reaction
- A → B and A → C
    - Two reactions that compete with each other
    - Rate constants k1 for the reaction A to B, k2 for the reaction A to C

## Review Questions on the Chapter Chemical Reactions
### Amount Relationships in Compounds and Reactions

What is a mole?
- A mole is a number of particles defined by Avogadro, namely 6×10^23. To avoid working with values that are too large when dealing with the number of particles, the so-called amount of substance is always given in the unit mole. The amount of substance is thus the number of particles divided by the number of particles per mole. Historically, 1 mole corresponds to the number of C atoms contained in 12 g of carbon.

Which two formulas are particularly often needed in stoichiometric calculations?
- The most important relation in stoichiometric calculations is between the mass of the particles and their number. The molar mass (M) is defined as the quotient of mass (m) and amount of substance (n). Since most chemical reactions take place in solution, the concentration of a substance is also an important quantity. Concentration c is defined as amount of substance (n) per solution volume (V).

What is a mass fraction?
- The mass fraction is an alternative to concentration, with which one can specify how large the mass of a substance in a solution is. It is calculated as the quotient of the mass of the dissolved particles and the total mass of the solution.

How large is the concentration of a solution that is created by mixing two solutions of different concentrations?
- When two solutions are mixed, the concentration of the dissolved substances can be calculated by multiplying them with their respective share of the total mixture volume and summing the concentrations if necessary.

### Reaction Equilibria

What is the equilibrium constant of a reaction and what does it mean when it is greater than 1 or less than 1?
- The equilibrium constant (K) is a number that describes whether a reaction equilibrium lies more on the side of the products (K > 1) or on the side of the reactants (K < 1). It is calculated as the quotient of the product of the concentrations of the products and the product of the concentrations of the reactants. For a reaction a A + b B ⇄ c C + d D, the equation would read: K = [C]^c × [D]^d / [A]^a × [B]^b.

Write down the formula to calculate the solubility product of magnesium chloride.
- The solubility product (K_L) describes the amount of a solid that can "go into solution" maximally at a given temperature. For example, from the solid MgCl2 a defined amount of Mg^2+ ions and twice the number of Cl^- ions dissolve in water. The reaction equation for the dissolution process of magnesium chloride is MgCl2 → Mg^2+ + 2 Cl^-. K_L is a simplification of the law of mass action: since the concentration of a solid (the reactant, in this case magnesium chloride) is comparatively high, this value can be set to 1, and it holds that: K_L = product of the concentrations of the products / concentration of the reactant = product of the concentrations of the products. For magnesium chloride it applies: K_L = [Mg^2+] × [Cl^-]^2.

### Selected Reaction Types

Which molecule is needed for the conversion of ATP to ADP + Pi, what happens to it during the reaction, and what is this type of reaction called?
- The splitting of ATP to ADP and Pi occurs by the incorporation of a water molecule. The reaction is therefore also called hydrolysis (“splitting by water”).

Which molecule is formed during the hydration of ethylene?
- During the hydration of alkenes (such as ethylene), a water molecule is added to the double bond of the alkene and an alcohol is formed. In our example, ethanol is formed.
