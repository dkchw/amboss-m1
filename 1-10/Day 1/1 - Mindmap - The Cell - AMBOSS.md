## Cell Membrane
- Construction of Membranes
    - Lipid bilayer
        - Construction
            - Amphiphilic lipids such as phospholipids or sphingolipids: Have a polar head group (e.g. phosphate, sphingosine) and nonpolar hydrocarbon tails (fatty acids)
            - Cholesterol: Has a polar OH group and a nonpolar steroid structure
                - Distribution of apolar and polar groups: In aqueous solution, the apolar hydrocarbon tails aggregate inward, while the polar head groups form an interface with the water in both directions → Stable lipid bilayers are formed, creating spherical structures (e.g. cells or vesicles).
                - Distribution of membrane lipids: While lipids can partially switch between the inner and outer lipid layers, certain lipids are predominantly found on one side.
                    - Outer lipid layer: Rich in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin
                    - Inner lipid layer: Rich in phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylinositol
                        - An increased expression of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface acts as a phagocytic signal
        - Properties
            - Permeability
                - Nearly impermeable to large polar molecules
                - Well permeable for small apolar compounds
            - Fluidity: Depending on the composition of the lipid bilayer and the temperature, the fluid properties of the membrane change.
                - High temperatures increase, low temperatures decrease fluidity.
                - Unsaturated fatty acids increase fluidity
                - Cholesterol
                    - Decreased membrane fluidity at higher temperatures
                    - Increases membrane fluidity at lower temperatures
            - Diffusion: The fluid properties of the lipid layer allow for the movement and spreading of individual molecules.
                - Lateral (parallel) diffusion: Within a lipid layer, individual lipid molecules are freely mobile.
                - Transverse Diffusion: Very slow, requires enzymatic support through flippases, floppases, or scramblases (so-called phospholipid translocators)
                    - Flippases: Move phospholipids from the outside to the inside
                    - Floppases: Move phospholipids from the inside to the outside
                    - Scramblases: Move phospholipids in both directions
    - Membrane Proteins
        -
            - Definition
                - Proteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer of membranes
                - Frequently glycoproteins
            - Membrane protein content in lipid bilayers: 20–80%
            - Types of membrane proteins
                - Integral Membrane Proteins
                    - Show a strong attachment to the lipid bilayer
                    - Penetrate the membrane with a part
                    - Transmembrane proteins: Completely penetrate the lipid bilayer (e.g., Na/K-ATPase++)
                - Peripheral membrane proteins
                    - Have a weaker binding to the lipid bilayer
                    - Often binding occurs through electrostatic attraction or hydrogen bonds between a peripheral and an integral membrane protein.
            - Distribution of membrane proteins: Different composition of the inner and outer membrane surfaces.
        -
            -
                - Examples of asymmetrically distributed membrane components

                -
                    - Unilateral integral membrane proteins
                    -
                        - Specific cyclooxygenases
                -
                    - Peripheral Membrane Proteins
                    - After Extracellular
                    -
                        - Carbohydrate Side Chains of Glycoproteins<br>- Erythrocytic Acetylcholinesterase
                -
                    - Intracellular
                    -
                        - Phospholipase C
        -
            - [!note] Antifungals
                  In the cell membrane of fungi, ergosterol, which is chemically related to cholesterol, is present instead of cholesterol. This fact is utilized in the fight against fungal diseases: Many antifungal medications (antimycotics) work by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis. Since ergosterol is not present in animal - and thus also in human - cells, these remain unharmed.
        -
            - [!note]
                  Due to their fluidity, membranes are permeable to water and certain other small particles even without the use of specific channels or transporters. This property is referred to as semipermeability ("partial permeability")!

        - Through the specific surface fragments, it can be distinguished from other cells and recognized as "self."
    - Electrical excitability
        - Enabled by the membrane potential
        - Upon excitation of the cell, the membrane potential briefly becomes positive by the opening of ion channels (see: action potential)
    - Cell contact: Formed by anchor proteins (cell adhesion molecules) that protrude extracellularly and are connected intracellularly to the cytoskeleton.

            - [!note] I-cell disease
                  In the Golgi apparatus, the enzymes that are to be transported to the lysosomes are tagged with a mannose-6-phosphate residue ("addressing"). Without this addressing, the enzymes cannot find their way into the lysosomes and instead pass through the plasma membrane into the blood. This is precisely what occurs in the extremely rare I-cell disease, which is classified as a lysosomal storage disorder and is associated with severe psychomotor retardation and skeletal deformities.

## Carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane
-
    - [!note]
              In the malate-aspartate shuttle, NADH+ is not transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but rather its electrons!
- Mitochondrial Matrix
    - Includes, among other things, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and some ribosomes that are responsible for the synthesis of approximately 1% of mitochondrial proteins (e.g., some proteins of the respiratory chain)
    - The remaining mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and arrive unfolded in the mitochondrion, where they assume their final folded structure.
- Function
    - Energy metabolism: At the inner mitochondrial membrane, a large portion of the energy in the form of ATP that the organism needs is produced in the respiratory chain through oxidative phosphorylation.
    - Other metabolic processes in the matrix
        - Citric acid cycle
        - Fatty acid degradation (β-Oxidation)
        - Ketone body synthesis
        - Urea Cycle
        - Pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction

- Excursus: Endosymbiotic Theory
    -
        - [!note] Aminoglycoside
              Due to the similarity of mitochondrial nucleic acids with those of bacteria, a specific mutation of mitochondrial DNA can lead to an increased occurrence of unwanted side effects when taking aminoglycoside antibiotics. These medications can be ototoxic and lead to deafness. Aminoglycosides actually target bacterial ribosomal RNA. However, if there is a mutation in mitochondrial DNA, the resulting mitochondrial ribosomal RNA is also altered in such a way that it becomes more sensitive to aminoglycosides. The exact cause of why the binding of aminoglycosides can lead to deafness is still not conclusively clarified.

        - [!note] Mitochondrial diseases
              Mitochondria are inherited maternally, and accordingly, so are the defects of mitochondrial DNA. Since mitochondria are present in very large numbers and not all need to be defective at the same time, there are significant variations in the type and severity of the disease. Tissues with high oxygen consumption, such as the brain (mitochondrial encephalopathy) or muscle (mitochondrial myopathies), are usually affected by such defects.
- Lysosomes
    - Structure
        -
            - A liquid space surrounded by a lipid bilayer with an acidic environment and hydrolytic enzymes
                - Hydrolytic enzymes: lipases, glucosidases, acid phosphatases, nucleases, endoproteases (e.g. cathepsins)
                    - Origin of the hydrolytic enzymes
                        - Enzymes are synthesized by ribosomes directly into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the Golgi apparatus.
                        - In the Golgi apparatus, a mannose-6-phosphate molecule is added post-translationally.
                        - Marked enzymes are pinched off in vesicles, this vesicle is now referred to as a primary lysosome.
                - Acidic environment (pH value of about 5)
                    - Optimal for the hydrolytic enzymes
                    - Results from the active transport of H+-ions through the membrane-bound H-ATPase+
        -
            - [!note]
                  The leading enzyme of the lysosomes is acid phosphatase!
    - Function
        -
            - Intracellular lysosomal degradation of macromolecules
                - Process
                    -
                        - 1. The lysosome in its resting state (primary lysosome) is formed by budding off from the Golgi apparatus.
                    -
                        - 2. Fuses with vesicles that contain structures to be degraded (now referred to as a secondary lysosome)
                    -
                        - 3. The hydrolytic enzymes contained in the secondary lysosome break down the macromolecules.
                    -
                        - 4. Split products are released into the cytosol and can be reused for new synthesis processes.
                    -
                        - 5. Telolysosomes (Residual Bodies): During lysosomal degradation, indigestible lipofuscin can form, which accumulates with age in nerve, liver, and cardiac muscle cells.
                - Origin of the macromolecules
                    - Endocytosis
                        - Receptor-mediated endocytosis: Vesicles are then called endosomes.
                        - Phagocytosis: Vesicles are then called phagosomes.
                    - Autophagy
                        - In all body cells, aged or dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and cell organelles are first separated from the cytoplasm by autophagosomes (also known as autophagic vacuoles) with a double membrane.
                        - Subsequently, they fuse with lysosomes to form an autolysosome.
                        - The inner membrane and the old cell components are broken down and are no longer differentiable.
                        - Breakdown products are subsequently released back into the cytosol (e.g. for the "recycling" of amino acids)
            - Autolysis: In the case of severe cell damage, the contents of the lysosomes are released into the cytosol. This causes the cell to dissolve (see also: apoptosis).
        -

                  Lysosomes play an important role in the specific immune response. Antigens are broken down in lysosomes after endocytic uptake in so-called antigen-presenting cells (e.g., macrophages, B-lymphocytes). The fragments are bound to MHC-II proteins, which are transported to the cell surface by exocytosis and expressed there (antigen presentation). This leads to the activation of T-helper cells!
- Peroxisomes
    - Structure
        - Small round vesicles that are surrounded by a membrane.
    - Function
        -
            - Degradation (β-Oxidation) of long-chain fatty acids to octanoyl-CoA (8 C-atoms)
            - Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
                - The monooxygenases in the peroxisomes convert their substrates using oxygen.
                - The cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced in the process is converted into water and oxygen using the enzyme catalase (2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2)
            - Synthesis of ether lipids (so-called plasmalogens)
            - Partial steps of steroid hormone synthesis, bile acid synthesis, etc.

            - [!note] Zellweger syndrome
                  In this hereditary disease, the formation and function of peroxisomes is significantly impaired, leading to an accumulation of cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide. Affected individuals suffer from neurological and hepatointestinal symptoms and usually die within the first year of life.

                  The cytoplasm encompasses everything that lies within the cell membrane but outside the nucleus. This includes the cytosol, the cell organelles, and the cytoskeleton!
- Ribosomes
    - Structure
        - General Structure
            - Granular particles made of ⅓ proteins and ⅔ RNA with two subunits
            - When multiple ribosomes attach to an mRNA, this complex is referred to as a polysome (also known as a polyribosome).
        - Mass: The mass of the subunits is specified using the sedimentation constant (unit: Svedberg, S).
            - Small subunit: 40S in eukaryotes, 30S in prokaryotes
            - Large subunit: 60S in eukaryotes, 50S in prokaryotes
            - Total mass: 80S in eukaryotes, 70S in prokaryotes
    - Localization
        - Cytosolic ribosomes: Are either free in the cytosol or bound to elements of the cytoskeleton.
        - Membrane-bound ribosomes: Are attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
    - Function
        -
            - Translation: Ribosomes provide the structural prerequisites for protein biosynthesis and are catalytically active; their RNA components interact, among other things, with mRNA and tRNA and catalyze the formation of the peptide bond.
                - For example, in prokaryotes, the mRNA binds to the 16S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit via a so-called Shine-Dalgarno sequence and regulates the initiation of translat

            - [!note]
                  Cytosolic proteins (such as tubulin) are synthesized on free ribosomes. Secretory proteins (that is, those intended for export) and membrane proteins are synthesized on the ribosomes of the rough ER!

            - [!note] Intermediate filaments as tumor markers
                  The filaments that normally occur in cells are also increasingly expressed during an uncontrolled division of these cells (in the sense of a tumor) and can therefore be used as immunohistochemical markers in tumor diagnostics. For example, vimentin – as an intermediate filament of the cytoskeleton of all mesenchymal cells – is primarily associated with tumors of mesenchymal origin such as sarcomas and mesotheliomas. Desmin – the intermediate filament in smooth and striated muscle – is, on the other hand, increasingly detectable in tumors of muscular origin such as rhabdomyosarcomas and leiomyosarcomas.

            - [!note] Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
                  The primary ciliary dyskinesia is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder of mucociliary transport. Often, the transport protein dynein is defective, which leads to a dysfunction of the cilia. Primarily affected is the respiratory ciliated epithelium, but sperm motility is also impaired. The consequences are chronic sinus infections as well as infertility in male affected individuals. In about half of the cases, there are positional anomalies of the organs during embryonic development, such as situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome).

## Cell Contacts
- Closing Contacts
    - Tight Junction (Zonula occludens or barrier contact): Consists of the membrane proteins Claudin and Occludin and serves as a very tight contact between two cells, which closes the intercellular space and acts as a diffusion barrier.
        - Structure
            - Membrane proteins (claudins and occludins) of two cells connect with each other.
            - They are connected to the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton through adapter proteins.
        - Localization: Often in the apical region between epithelial cells
        - Function
            - Controls the flow of ions and molecules
            - Diffusion barrier
            - Separation of compartments (e.g., intestinal lumen from intestinal wall): Separates the basal from the apical cell compartments of the epithelial cells.
- Adhesive Contacts (Adhesion Contacts)
    - Desmosome (macula adherens): connection of two cells with each other involving the intermediate filaments of the participating cells.
        - Structure
            - On the inner side of the cell membrane, there is a so-called desmoplakin plaque, into which the involved intermediate filaments enter from the intracellular side and the so-called desmosomal cadherins (mainly desmoglein and desmocollin) radiate from the extracellular side.
            - The cadherins connect the desmoplakin plaques of two cells with each other.
        - Occurrence/Function: Connecting, especially cells with high mechanical stress (e.g. epithelial cells and cardiac muscle cells)
    - Hemidesmosome ("Half Desmosome"): Connects not two cells, but a cell with the extracellular space.
        - Structure (similar to desmosomes): The transmembrane protein integrin connects the intracellular cytoskeleton (the intermediate filaments) with the laminin molecules of the basement membrane.
        - Occurrence/Function: Connects epithelial cells to the basement membrane
    - Adherens junction (belt desmosome): Connects cells closely together over a wider (belt-like) area.
        - Structure: On the inner side of the cell membrane, there is Vinculin and Catenin, which connect intracellular actin filaments with transmembrane cadherins (mainly E-Cadherin).
