# Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
## Summary

Through the direct connection between the body's interior and the outside world, microorganisms can easily penetrate the body via the aerodigestive and urogenital tracts. Therefore, a special protection from the immune system is necessary here. As an MALT system (Mucosa-Associated Lymphatic Tissue), all mucosa-associated lymphocytes and the lymphatic tissue of the mucous membranes are summarized. These can be organized in an organ-like manner (e.g., tonsils, Peyer’s patches) or occur as solitary lymph follicles in the mucous membrane and ensure immune defense in these highly pathogen-exposed regions.
## Profile

- Definition: Totality of all mucosa-associated lymphocytes and the lymphatic tissue of the mucous membranes.
- Functions: As lymphoepithelial tissue of the mucous membranes, the MALT system, often separated only by a single-layer mucosal cell layer, is in almost direct contact with the outside world. Thus, it is subject to high pathogen exposure, from which its functions are derived.

    - Targeted routing of antigens to immune cells
    - Presentation of antigens
    - Prevention of pathogen spread
    - Pathogen elimination

    Location: Lamina propria of the mucous membranes
- Outline: Depending on the region, the MALT system can be divided into different sections, including
    - Tonsils (Nasal-Pharyngeal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue = NALT)
    - Gut-associated lymphatic tissue (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue = GALT)
    - Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT)
    - Lymphatic tissue of the urogenital tract
## General Structure

The fundamental structure of the mucosal-associated lymphatic tissue resembles that of other secondary lymphatic organs. In addition to lymph follicles (B-zones) and T-zones between the follicles, the MALT system also consists of a reticular framework. Furthermore, it possesses a specialized epithelium (follicle-associated epithelium = FAE), humoral defense mechanisms, and in the gastrointestinal tract, additionally has cells (M-cells) that are specifically pre-destined for the translocation of antigens.

- B-Zone: B cells are arranged in the form of lymph follicles.
- T-Zone: Perifollicular grouped T-lymphocytes
- Follicle-associated epithelium (FAE): Mesh-like, loose structure with discontinuous basement membrane → Allows antigen translocation
    - M cells: Cells located between the follicle-associated epithelium, primarily found in the vaginal and gastrointestinal tract → Allow the translocation of antigens to the immune cells in the lamina propria via transcytosis
- Humoral defense mechanisms
    - Epithelial-produced protective factors: mucins (mucus) and defensins
    - Plasma cells activated by antigen contact produce antibodies: In particular, IgA (which coats the mucosal surface like a type of protective film)

Since the MALT system is confronted with the normal bacterial flora and dietary bacteria compared to other secondary lymphatic organs, it must be ensured that a balance between tolerance and defense is maintained!

Immune defense vs. disease facilitation
Through their function in antigen transport, M cells and intraepithelial dendritic cells serve the immune defense. The M cells were important, for example, by facilitating the uptake of oral vaccines during the polio oral vaccination that was conducted until a few years ago. However, M cells also allow for easier passage of pathogens such as the typhus pathogen. Intraepithelial dendritic cells can also promote diseases by, for example, facilitating the entry of the HIV virus in the vaginal epithelium. By binding and transporting it to the lymph nodes, the virus can easily infect the CD4+ cells.
## The tonsils (= tonsils; NALT)

The tonsils are located as lymphoepithelial organs in the entrance area of the oral and nasal cavities to the pharynx and serve as a part of the immune defense in this highly antigen-exposed region. Collectively, they can be summarized as the Waldeyer's ring of the pharynx, which encircles the upper part of the pharynx and consists of the following components:

- Pharyngeal tonsil (= adenoid)
- Palatine tonsil (= tonsil)
- Lingual tonsil (= tonsilla lingualis)
- Tubal tonsil (= Tubal tonsil)
- Side strands

### Structure, Location, and Histological Besonderheiten

As a so-called lymphoepithelial organ, the lymphatic tissue of the tonsils is embedded in reticular connective tissue directly beneath the epithelium. The invaginations (crypts) of the epithelium lead to a significant increase in surface area, which allows for better antigen contact and results in a convoluted appearance of the tonsillar surface. Histologically, the epithelium of the respective tonsils corresponds to that of the surrounding region. In the area of the follicles, it possesses, as follicle-associated epithelium, a loosely organized cell structure with a discontinuous basement membrane and is network-like expanded. This facilitates interaction between follicle epithelium and lymphocytes. The lymph follicles typically present as secondary follicles (B-zone) with a germinal center and a mantle zone oriented towards the surface. The zone between the follicles is referred to as the interfollicular zone (T-zone).

> [!NOTE] Adenoid Vegetations (Polyps)
> In preschool age, children are particularly frequently exposed to respiratory infections. The pharyngeal tonsil (tonsilla pharyngealis) shows its greatest development at this time, later becoming smaller again. In cases of severe hyperplasia, there may be an obstruction of the choanae and the ostium of the auditory tube. Children breathe more through their mouths and may develop a tympanic cavity effusion with conductive hearing loss due to the tube obstruction. Therefore, surgical removal (adenotome) of the pharyngeal tonsils may become necessary.

> [!NOTE] Tonsillitis (Tonsillar angina)  
> The highly convoluted palatine tonsils are very susceptible to purulent inflammations. They are largest during elementary school age, after which they shrink again. However, in cases of recurrent inflammations, the tonsils may also remain enlarged. Surgical removal (tonsillectomy) should only be performed after careful consideration due to their immunological function and the risk of postoperative bleeding.

### Vascular Supply

The vascular supply of the tonsils is provided exclusively by small blood vessels due to their very small size. However, because of the high clinical relevance (possible post-operative bleeding after a tonsillectomy), the arterial supply of the palatine tonsil should be considered, which shows a high degree of variability.

|Vascular supply of the tonsils|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Through small afferent blood vessels<br>- Palatine tonsil<br>    - Dorsal branches of the tongue from the A. lingualis<br>    - Tonsillar branches from the A. facialis and the A. palatina ascendens<br>    - Pharyngeal branches from the A. pharyngea ascendens<br>    - A. palatina descendens from the A. maxillaris|
|Venous|- Pharyngeal venous plexus in the internal jugular vein
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymphatic vessels/stations|- No afferent, but small efferent lymphatic vessels<br>- Palatine tonsil: Via the submandibular lymph nodes further into the cervical lymph nodes (superior deep lateral cervical lymph nodes)|

> [!NOTE]
> A postoperative bleeding (e.g., from the maxillary artery) following a tonsillectomy can have life-threatening consequences. Therefore, the variable course of the blood vessels and the arterial supply to the palatine tonsils should be well understood!

## The Gut-associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)

The lymphatic tissue of the intestine serves to defend against pathogens that are ingested with food. It is located in the lamina propria of the entire digestive tract, where it exists in the form of individual immune cells or solitary lymph follicles, or as follicle aggregates (the so-called Peyer's patches). Due to their special structure, the Peyer's patches will be discussed in more detail at this point.

### Peyer’s Patches (Aggregated Lymphoid Nodules)

- Location: Largest manifestation in the lamina propria of the ileum
- Construction
    - Macroscopically: Accumulation of secondary lymph follicles in the form of follicle aggregates
    - Microscopic
        - Dom: Each follicle is dome-shaped and separated by connective tissue from the epithelium.
        - Follicle-associated epithelium (dome epithelium): Unlike regular enterocytes, it has no villi, crypts, or goblet cells.
            - M-cells
## Review Questions on the Chapter Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue
### General Structure

What distinguishes mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue from the other secondary lymphatic organs in the body?
- The basic structure of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) resembles that of other secondary lymphatic organs. In addition to lymph follicles (B-zones) and T-zones between the follicles, it also has a specialized epithelium (follicle-associated epithelium = FAE), which, due to its spatial proximity to the lymph follicle and its network-like, loosened structure, enables antigen translocation to the lymphocytes of the MALT system.

What special cell type is particularly found in the follicle-associated epithelium of the GALT and what is its function?
- Between the intestinal epithelial cells, the so-called M-cells are found. The "M" stands for the English term "microfold" and refers to the fact that, unlike enterocytes, M-cells do not have microvilli but only shorter microplicae on the apical cell membrane. M-cells enable the translocation (transcytosis) of antigens to the immune cells located beneath the epithelium, namely in the Peyer's patches.

### The tonsils (= tonsils; NALT)

Describe the location of the palatine tonsil and name its histological characteristics!
- The paired tonsilla palatina (palatine tonsil) lies between the arcus palatoglossus (= anterior palatine arch) and the arcus palatopharyngeus (= posterior palatine arch) in the tonsillar fossa at the isthmus faucium. Histologically, it is recognized by lymph follicles, very deep and branched crypts filled with detritus, and a multilayered, non-keratinized squamous epithelium that covers it. The squamous epithelium can sometimes also be infiltrated with lymphocytes.

Which other tonsil can be easily confused histologically with the palatine tonsil? What should be considered in the microscopic differentiation?
- The structure of the tonsilla lingualis, which as a single tonsil lies at the base of the tongue, largely resembles that of the tonsilla palatina, as both show a multilayered, non-keratinized squamous epithelium on their surface. However, the crypts of the unpaired lingual tonsil are shallower and unbranched. Furthermore, in the lingual tonsil one usually also finds larger areas of skeletal muscle (tongue muscles).

How is the palatine tonsil supplied with blood? Why is this clinically relevant?
- The paired tonsilla palatina is variably supplied by branches from four different arteries, all of which originate from the external carotid artery. These are, from caudal to cranial: the lingual artery (branch: dorsal lingual branch), the facial artery (branch: ascending palatine artery), the ascending pharyngeal artery (branches: pharyngeal branches), and the maxillary artery (branch: descending palatine artery). These vessels show considerable variability from person to person. Due to the blood supply from several vessels and their variability, particular care must be taken during surgical removal of the palatine tonsils to avoid postoperative bleeding.

Where is the pharyngeal tonsil located? What histological feature does it have?
- The tonsilla pharyngealis (pharyngeal tonsil) lies as an unpaired organ on the roof of the pharynx at the transition to the nasopharynx (= epipharynx) and thus adjacent to the openings of the two auditory tubes (Eustachian tubes). It has respiratory ciliated epithelium and, unlike the palatine and lingual tonsils, does not have crypts but contains shallow recesses into which mixed glands open.

What is a common disease associated with the pharyngeal tonsil? Name typical symptoms!
- Due to its proximity to the auditory tubes, a pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia, frequently occurring in preschool age (also called adenoids or colloquially "polyps"), can block the openings of the auditory tubes, preventing pressure equalization between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx. This favors a middle ear effusion, which can lead to conductive hearing loss. At the same time, the posterior openings of the nasal cavity (choanae) are often also blocked, so affected children usually show nasal speech, chronic runny nose, and mouth breathing.
