# Spine
## Summary

The spine forms the central component of the axial skeleton in the human body. It consists of vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and ligaments that are connected by a variety of joints. This allows the spine to maintain a high degree of mobility despite its supportive function.

The spine is composed of several sections: the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, followed by the sacrum and coccyx. Each vertebra, in turn, consists of a vertebral body and the vertebral arch with its extensions. The specific anatomy of the vertebrae varies depending on the section of the spine and is crucial for the respective mobility of that section. An exception is made for the first two cervical vertebrae, atlas and axis, whose joint connection allows for a high and differentiated mobility of the head.

Since the development of the spine is related to some fundamental developmental steps of the mesoderm germ layer, it is discussed in the chapter "Embryonic Development" (see: Gastrulation).
## Construction Principle and Function of the Spine

### Structural Principle of the Spine

The spine consists of 23 movement segments, which are made up of the vertebrae, intervertebral discs, and the ligamentous apparatus. The connection between two vertebrae is relatively firm and corresponds to about a false joint (synchondrosis), so the mobility of an individual movement segment is low. However, the sum of the mobility of the 23 segments results in the overall mobility of the entire spine being very high.

- Components of the spine
    - Vertebrae (Vertebrae)
    - Intervertebral discs (Disci intervertebrales)
    - Bands
- Shape of the spine: Double S-shape due to two consecutive curves
    - Lordosis: Ventral convex curvature of the spine
    - Kyphosis: Ventral concave curvature of the spine
- Sections of the spine: cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine, sacrum, coccyx

|Spinal Section|Number of Vertebrae|Abbreviation|Curvature|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cervical spine (C1-C7)|7 cervical vertebrae (Vertebrae cervicales)|C1–C7|Lordosis|
|Thoracic spine (T spine)|12 thoracic vertebrae (Vertebrae thoracicae)|T1–T12|Kyphosis|
|Lumbar spine (LWS)|5 lumbar vertebrae (Vertebrae lumbales)|LWK1–LWK5|Lordosis|
|Sacrum (Os sacrum)|5 Sacral vertebrae (Vertebrae sacrales)|SWK1–SWK5|Kyphosis|
|Coccyx (Os coccygis)|3–5 coccygeal vertebrae (Vertebrae coccygeae)|/|-|

- Transitional vertebra: A congenital numerical variation at the boundaries of the spinal sections is referred to as a transitional vertebra or assimilation vertebra.
    - Lumbarization: S1 is not fused with the sacrum and appears independently as a free vertebra.
        - Hemilumbalisation: SWK 1 is unilaterally present as a free vertebra independent of the sacrum.
    - Sacralization: LWK 5 is fused with the sacrum.
        - Hemisacralization: L5 is fused unilaterally with the sacrum.
### Function of the Spine

Despite the static function of the spine, which provides the necessary stability of the axial skeleton, it still allows for a wide range of movement of the torso around three axes. Thus, the spine represents an evolutionarily shaped compromise between statics and the necessary mobility while simultaneously minimizing the energy expenditure of the involved trunk muscles.

- Static Function
    - Support framework
    - Damping of axial shocks
    - Protection of the spinal cord
- Dynamic function: The spine allows for high mobility of the torso around three axes
    - Flexion (Ventral flexion)/Extension (Dorsal extension)
    - Lateral bending (Lateral flexion)
    - Rotation around the longitudinal axis (Rotation)
## Vertebrae (Vertebrae)

### Structure of a Vertebra

Each vertebra consists of a vertebral body and a vertebral arch with its processes.

- Vertebral body (Corpus vertebrae)
    - Bearing element of the spine
    - Size increases from cervical spine to lumbar spine.
    - Carries the intervertebral discs (intervertebral discs, Disci intervertebrales) on their upper/lower side.
- Vertebral arch (Arcus vertebrae)
    - The arcus and corpus of the vertebra together form the vertebral foramen.
    - Arises dorsally at the vertebral body
    - Extensions
        - Articular processes (joint processes): Arranged in pairs
            - Upper articular processes: Projections directed cranially on both sides
            - Lower articular processes: Bilaterally directed projections toward the caudal end
        - Transverse processes (transverse processes): Paired arrangement
            - At the BWS joint partner of the rib joint
            - Ansatz region for autochthonous back muscles
        - Spinous process (spine): Simply arranged
- Vertebral foramen
    - The totality of all vertebrates forms the vertebral canal (Canalis vertebralis)
    - Limited ventrally by the vertebral body and dorsally by the vertebral arch
- Intervertebral foramen (Foramen intervertebrale)
    - Between two vertebrae and their intervertebral discs, there is a hole on each side of the spine.
    - Serve as an exit from the vertebral canal for the spinal nerves and vessels.

> [!NOTE] Osteoporosis
> In osteoporosis, there is a decrease in bone density due to increased bone resorption or decreased bone metabolism. This primarily affects the vertebral bodies - the trabecular structures inside the vertebral body become less, often leaving only a "frame structure" made of cortical bone. If a pathological fracture occurs, characteristic deformations of the vertebral bodies may be visible in the X-ray image: so-called fish vertebrae when there is a collapse of the upper and lower plates, or wedge vertebrae when there is a fracture of the anterior vertebral body alone.

### Structure of the Vertebrae Sections in Comparison

Depending on the section of the spine, the vertebrae exhibit characteristic features.

| Feature                                                  |Cervical vertebrae|Thoracic vertebrae|Lumbar vertebrae|
|---|---|---|---|
| Shape of the vertebral body (in the transverse plane)    |- Rectangular|- Wedge-shaped|- Bean-shaped|
| Characteristic structures                                |- Transverse foramen<br>- Uncinate processes|- Superior costal facet and inferior costal facet|- Accessory processes<br>- Costal processes<br>- Mammillary processes|
| Orientation of the joint surfaces (at Proc. articulares) |- Sloping backward (approx. 45° angle)|- Vertically aligned|- Predominantly positioned sagittally|
| Transverse processes                                     |- Anterior and posterior tubercle<br>- Enclose the transverse foramen|- Costal facet of the transverse process|- Mammillary and accessory processes|
| Dornfortsätze                                            |- Horizontal running<br>- Forked|- Steeply running caudally<br>- Layered like roof tiles|- Horizontal running<br>- Laterally flattened|
| Swirl hole                                               |- Large triangular cross-section|- Round cross-section|- Small triangular cross-section|
| Rib rudiments                                            |- Anterior tubercle|- None|- Costal processes|
| Range of motion                                          |- High mobility|- Moderately high mobility|- Low mobility|

### Two special cervical vertebrae: Atlas and Axis

The first two cervical vertebrae have their own names (Atlas and Axis) because their structure differs significantly from the basic form of the other vertebrae. Their joint connection allows for a high and differentiated mobility of the head around three axes.

|                    |Atlas (C1)|Axis (C2)|
|---|---|---|
| Definition         |First cervical vertebra|Second cervical vertebra|
| Function           |Form together with the occipital bone the cranial joints|   |
| Identifier         |Ring-shaped|The axis|
| Vertebral body     |Not present|Present|
| Transverse process |Not present|Present: Fork-shaped|
| Articular surfaces |5|6|

> [!NOTE]
> The dynamic function (mobility) of the spine decreases from cranial to caudal! In contrast, the static function and the size of the vertebrae increase from cranial to caudal!

> [!NOTE] Spondylolysis and Spondylolisthesis
> Spondylolysis or spondylolyse refers to a gap in the vertebral arch at the so-called interarticular portion. The interarticular portion is the bone segment between the upper and lower articular processes of a vertebra (Proc. articularis superior et inferior). In more than 90% of cases, the lumbar spine is affected (L4 or L5). Spondylolysis usually does not cause symptoms but always results in increased mobility of the lumbar spine, which can trigger the clinical picture of spondylolisthesis. Spondylolisthesis refers to the so-called vertebral slippage: here, the abnormally mobile vertebra can slide ventrally over the vertebral body beneath it, which can lead to load-dependent back pain and, less frequently, to neurological deficits due to compression of spinal roots. Affected individuals should primarily receive physiotherapeutic treatment to strengthen the back muscles.

## Bands

The ligaments of the spine run partially between adjacent vertebrae, but also over larger sections. Their main function is to stabilize the spine, while they also partially support the back muscles.

|Band|Function|Course|Features|
|---|---|---|---|
|Anterior longitudinal ligament (anterior longitudinal ligament)|- Limitation of dorsal extension|- Ventral side over the entire length of the spine|- Fused with the cortex of the vertebral bodies|
|Posterior longitudinal ligament (posterior longitudinal ligament)|- Limitation of ventral flexion|- Dorsally along the entire length of the spinal column|- Fused with intervertebral discs|
|Supraspinous ligament|- Between the ends of the spinous processes (from C7 to the sacrum)|- Transitions into the nuchal ligament at the cervical spine|
|Nuchal ligament|- Between the external occipital protuberance and the spinous processes of the cervical spine|- Corresponds to the cranial continuation of the supraspinous ligament & interspinous ligaments<br>- High content of elastic fibers|
|Ligg. flava (Yellow ligaments)|- Limitation of ventral flexion<br>- Support of the back muscles|- Between the laminae of adjacent vertebral arches|- High content of elastic fibers|
|Interspinous ligaments|- Limitation of ventral flexion<br>- Prevention of vertebral sliding|- Between the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae|- Transition to the supraspinous ligament|
|Ligg. intertransversaria|- Limitation of lateral flexion and rotation|- Between the transverse processes of adjacent vertebrae|- Only weakly developed in the cervical spine|
## Joints of the Spine

### False Joints of the Spine (Synarthroses)

The false joints of the spine mainly include the intervertebral joints, in which the intervertebral discs sit, as well as the so-called uncovertebral joints, which only occur in the cervical spine.

#### Intervertebral Joint and Intervertebral Disc

Between two adjacent vertebral bodies lies the intervertebral space, which contains a fibrocartilaginous intervertebral disc (intervertebral disc). Above, the vertebral bodies are connected to each other articulately. Since the intervertebral disc is fused with the surrounding vertebral bodies, the joint is classified as a symphysis.

- Intervertebral disc (Discus intervertebralis)
    - Definition: Tissue disc made of fibrocartilage, dense collagenous connective tissue, and gelatinous nucleus.
    - Structure
        - Nucleus pulposus: Inner jelly core
        - Anulus fibrosus: Outer fibrous ring
    - Function: Damping and distribution of body weight



> [!NOTE] Disc herniation
> During the course of life, degenerative changes can lead to the extrusion of disc material (particularly from the nucleus pulposus) from the annulus fibrosus. This typically occurs in most cases after passing medially-laterally along the posterior longitudinal ligament. As a result, there may be compression of the spinal canal or a nerve root, which typically leads to a so-called radicular syndrome. In this condition, patients suffer from back pain as well as loss of function in the affected segment of the spinal cord (e.g., reduced sensation and paresis of the great toe with compression at the level of L5). In most cases, a herniated disc can be treated conservatively.

#### Uncovertebral Joints (Uncovertebral Articulations)

- Definition: Joint between the uncinate processes of a caudally located vertebral body and the cranially located vertebral body.
- Function: Unclear, increase in range of motion is being discussed.
- Involved Structures
    - Uncinate processes (hooked processes) of the caudal vertebrae
        - Hook-shaped lateral bony projections of the cervical vertebrae C3–C7
        - Enclose the intervertebral disc laterally.
    - Vertebrae of the cranially located vertebra
    - Intervertebral disc
- Formation: Procc. uncinati grow within the first decade of life → Intervertebral disc bulges laterally → Shear forces in the intervertebral disc increase → Formation of fissures

### True Joints of the Spine (Diarthroses)

The true joints of the spine include the two cranial joints (upper and lower cranial joints) as well as the facet joints.

#### Head Joints

The atlanto-occipital joints allow for finely-tuned movements of the head around three axes: extension (tilting the head backward) and flexion (nodding), as well as lateral flexion and rotation of the head. This high range of motion is of great importance, as it enables the precise alignment of the sensory organs located on the head. One distinguishes between the upper atlanto-occipital joint (Art. atlantooccipitalis) and the lower joint (Art. atlantoaxialis), which in turn consists of two component joints.

##### Upper cervical joint (atlantooccipital joint)

- Definition: Paired joint between the occipital bone (Os occipitale) and the first cervical vertebra (Atlas)
- Functions
    - Extension/Flexion
    - Lateral inclination
- Joint type: Ellipsoid joint
- Articulating structures: Occipital bone (Occipital condyles) and Atlas (Superior articular facet)
- Involved ligaments: anterior and posterior atlantooccipital membranes

##### Lower cervical joint (Atlantoaxial joint)

- Definition: A joint composed of two sub-joints between the Atlas and Axis
- Function: Rotation
- Joint type: Pivot joint (trochoid type)
- Partial joints
    - Median atlantoaxial joint
        - Dens axis (front side) and Fovea dentis (Atlas)
        - Dens axis (back side) and Lig. transversum
    - Atlantoaxial lateral joint (paired)
        - Inferior articular surface (Atlas) and superior articular process (Axis)
- Involved ligaments: Lig. alaria, Lig. apicis dentis, Lig. transversum atlantis, Longitudinal bundles, Tectorial membrane, Anterior and posterior atlantooccipital membranes
- Topography: Located at the level of the naso- or oropharynx

#### Intervertebral Joints (Intervertebral Joints, Zygapophyseal Joints, Facet Joints)

Two adjacent vertebrae are connected to each other by a paired vertebral joint. These joints are an important basis for the mobility of the spine around three axes.

- Definition: Paired joints between the articular processes of two adjacent vertebral bodies.
- Function: Enable the mobility of the spine around three axes → See also next section
- Articulating structures: inferior articular processes (of the cranial vertebra) and superior articular processes (of the caudal vertebra)
## Range of Motion of the Spine

The following table shows which movements are possible at the spinal sections connected by intervertebral discs and to what extent (according to the Neutral Zero Method).

|Section|Extension/Flexion|Lateral Flexion|Rotation|Background|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|HWS|70/0/45°|45/0/45°|80/0/80°|- Increased mobility due to the cervical joints|
|BWS|25/0/35°|20/0/20°|40/0/40°|- Reduced mobility due to connection to ribs/thorax|
|LWS|30/0/50°|20/0/20°|10/0/10°|- Almost sagittally standing articular processes (joint processes) of the vertebral arch joints → Rotation is heavily limited|
|Total Values|125/0/125°|85/0/85°|130/0/130°|- Summation of individual values from cervical spine, thoracic spine & lumbar spine|

> [!NOTE] Examination of the spine
> Due to its supportive function, the spine is affected by many signs of wear and tear. Back pain is therefore a very common reason for consultation in general medical practice. In clinical everyday life, it is particularly important to be able to investigate spinal complaints differentially. In addition to a thorough medical history (especially regarding pain and stress), an inspection, palpation, percussion, and a mobility examination should be conducted (see: Orthopedic Examination of the Spine).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Spine
Where are the intervertebral foramina located and which structures pass through them?
- The intervertebral foramina are paired openings, each located between two adjacent vertebrae and bounded ventrally by the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs. They serve as the exit for the spinal nerves and vessels from the vertebral canal.
What structures are typically found only on thoracic vertebrae, but not on cervical and lumbar vertebrae?
- The thoracic vertebral bodies each have on both sides a cranial and a caudal articular surface for articulation with the rib heads (costovertebral joints). These articular surfaces are called the superior costal facet and inferior costal facet and occur only on the thoracic vertebrae.
Which structures of the lumbar vertebrae are remnants of the ribs?
- On both sides of the lumbar vertebral bodies there are strong processes called costal processes, which represent rudimentary ribs.
Up to approximately how many degrees (according to the neutral-zero method) is rotation in the lumbar spine possible? What limits it?
- Rotation of the lumbar spine is only very limited; the range of motion according to the neutral-zero method is 10°-0-10°. The reason for this is mainly the sagittal orientation of the articular processes of the vertebral arch joints, which nearly prevents rotation.
