# Bone Marrow and Blood Formation
## Summary

The bone marrow is the soft tissue that fills the cavities of all bones. It is the only organ responsible for blood formation (=hematopoiesis) after birth and is classified as a primary lymphatic organ. Depending on hematopoietic activity, two forms are distinguished: the red (blood-forming) bone marrow and the yellow (non-blood-forming, fat-storing) bone marrow. In children, only red bone marrow is present; from the fifth year of life, the blood-forming marrow begins to retract from most bones and is replaced by fat-tissue infiltrated marrow. Healthy adults only find red bone marrow in the epiphyses of long bones and in the bones of the axial skeleton.

Histologically, bone marrow consists of a special form of connective tissue, the reticular connective tissue, which is found only in the bone marrow and the secondary lymphatic organs. The reticular cells present here, together with the matrix rich in reticular fibers and cytokine-storing properties, create the necessary conditions for the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as the migration of mature cells into the blood.

From the multipotent hematopoietic stem cells of the red bone marrow, determined precursor cells (colony forming units, CFU) arise under the influence of signaling substances (stem cell factor, SCF), whose further differentiation is predetermined to one or two closely related cell types. Under the influence of specific growth factors (colony stimulating factors, CSF), they finally mature into terminally differentiated blood cells and leave the bone marrow.
## Bone Marrow

Blood formation (hematopoiesis) takes place in the bone marrow. To understand hematopoiesis, it helps to learn more about the structure of the bone marrow.

### Profile of Bone Marrow

- Definition: Soft tissue that fills the internal cavities of all bones and is classified as one of the primary lymphatic organs.
- Functions
    - Blood formation (= hematopoiesis)
    - Breakdown of aged erythrocytes
    - Maturation of B lymphocytes
- Weight: Approximately 4% of an adult's body weight
    - Red Mark: Approx. 2%
    - Yellow Mark: Approx. 2%
- Vascular supply: branches of the A. nutricia of the corresponding bone

### Macroscopic Anatomy

In the bone marrow, the red, hematopoietically active marrow can be distinguished from the yellow, hematopoietically inactive fatty marrow macroscopically by the cross-sectional area.

| **Localization** | - Children: In all bones<br>- Adults:<br>  - Short and flat bones (e.g., sternum, vertebral bodies)<br>  - Long tubular bones: Epiphyses (e.g., head of the femur and head of the humerus) | - Children: Not yet present<br>- Adults: Metaphyses and diaphyses of the long tubular bones |

> [!NOTE]
> In adults, red bone marrow is found only in the bones of the axial skeleton: Blood formation mainly occurs in the bones of the skull, spine, and thorax (scapula, sternum, and ribs)! Yellow marrow, on the other hand, is primarily found in the diaphyses of the extremities!

### Microscopic Anatomy

Both the yellow and red bone marrow can be divided into two compartments: the hematopoietic compartment, where the actual maturation of blood cells takes place, and the blood compartment, where the matured cells can enter the bloodstream. If there are particularly many fat cells in the hematopoietic compartment, it is referred to as yellow bone marrow; if there are relatively few fat cells, it can be referred to as red bone marrow.

#### Hematopoietic compartment (= Extravasal space of the bone marrow)

- Hematopoietic stem cells
    - From them, all blood cells develop.
    - Stem cell type: Multipotent
- Immature and mature blood cell stages (e.g., erythroblasts): Make up the majority of cells in the red bone marrow.
- Plasma cells (mature B cells)
- Stroma: Composed of reticular connective tissue
    - Cells in the stroma
        - Fibroblastic reticulum cells
        - Macrophages
        - Fat cells (adipocytes)
            - Lower fat cell content in red bone marrow
            - High fat cell content in yellow bone marrow
    - Extracellular matrix: In particular, reticular fibers

#### Blood compartment (= Intravascular space of the bone marrow)

- Wide, blood-filled sinusoids
    - Discontinuous endothelium
    - Projections of the reticulum cells

> [!NOTE] Bone marrow donation
> In the case of several diseases of the blood-forming system (e.g., congenital forms of anemia, leukemia), therapeutic bone marrow donation is the only possible cure. In this process, a suitable donor is usually anesthetized, and about one liter of red bone marrow is extracted from the pelvic crest using a special needle. The hematopoietic stem cells contained within are concentrated in a so-called bone marrow concentrate, which is administered to the recipient through a venous catheter intravenously. The stem cells then migrate autonomously from the blood to the recipient's bone marrow and begin the process of blood formation. However, this transfer can only take place after the destruction of the diseased recipient's bone marrow through irradiation and/or chemotherapy, in order to minimize the number of diseased bone marrow cells (e.g., in leukemia) and to prevent an immune response from the recipient's immune system against the donor cells to be transferred. For the donating person, there are no permanent consequences, as the amount of extracted bone marrow regenerates after approximately two weeks.

> [!NOTE] Fat embolism
> After a traumatic bone fracture, but also in certain surgical bone procedures (e.g., hip prosthesis implantation), a so-called fat embolism can occur. An embolism is the blockage of an arterial vessel by material that has been carried into the bloodstream. Depending on the material, one differentiates between thromboembolisms (blood clots), air embolisms (gas bubbles), or fat embolisms, the latter typically triggered by yellow bone marrow (fat marrow): When the long tubular bones, which in adults mainly contain yellow bone marrow, are subjected to stress due to fracture or increased pressure during the implantation of a prosthesis, fat cell aggregates or fat droplets can enter the bloodstream and block smaller arterial vessels (typically in the lungs). Depending on the number of vessels involved, the fat embolism can be asymptomatic to life-threatening, presenting symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (shortness of breath, lip cyanosis, signs of right heart strain).

## Blood Formation (Hematopoiesis)

The formation of blood (hematopoiesis) occurs primarily in the spleen and liver in the unborn, and exclusively in the bone marrow in adults. Hematopoiesis describes the individual maturation steps, starting from the bone marrow stem cell to the mature blood cell.

### Profile on Hematopoiesis

- Definition: Hematopoiesis is the umbrella term for the development of the various blood cell lineages.
- Division: Two main lines from which all blood cell types arise
    - Myeloid series
        - Precursor cell: Myeloid progenitor cell (common myeloid precursor = CMP)
        - Stem cell type: Oligopotent
        - Maturation: Erythropoiesis, Thrombopoiesis, Granulopoiesis, Monopoiesis
    - Lymphatic series
        - Precursor cell: Lymphoid progenitor cell (common lymphoid precursor = CLP)
        - Stem cell type: Oligopotent
        - Maturation: Lymphopoiesis
- Localization
    - Fetal Hematopoiesis
        1. From 3. SSW: Yolk sac (Extraembryonic Phase = syn. Megaloblastic Phase)
        2. 6. SSW - 4. Development Month: Liver and Spleen (Hepatosplenic Phase)
        3. From the 5th month of development: Red bone marrow (Medullary phase)
    - Adult Hematopoiesis: Red Bone Marrow
- Process
    1. Hematopoietic stem cell (multipotent)
    2. Myeloid or lymphoid progenitor cell (oligopotent)
    3. CFU-Cell
        - Progenitor cell that is already assigned to one or two cell types (uni- or bipotent)
        - Examples: CFU-E (precursor cell of erythrocytes), CFU-G/M (precursor cell for granulocytes and monocytes)

### The five lineages of hematopoiesis

#### Erythropoiesis

- Duration and steps of development: See: Erythrocytes (Erythropoiesis)
- Stimulating Hormones: Erythropoietin (EPO)

#### Thrombopoiesis

- Duration: 5–10 days
- Development steps: CMP → CFU-Meg. → Megakaryoblast → Promegakaryocyte → Megakaryocyte → Platelet
- Stimulating hormones: Thrombopoietin (TPO) from the liver, IL-11
- Special cells
    - Promegakaryocyte
        - Precursor cell of platelets
        - Has numerous granules that contain co-factors of coagulation (ADP, Ca2+)
    - Megakaryocyte
        - Precursor cell of platelets
        - Large nucleus (= "megakaryo") with polyploid chromosome set (up to 64n!)
        - Platelets are formed by the budding off of granule-containing, anucleate cytoplasmic fragments.
        - Up to 5000 platelets arise from a megakaryocyte.

#### Granulopoiesis

- Duration: 7-10 days
- Development steps: CMP → CFU-G/M → Myeloblast → Promyelocyte → Myelocyte → Metamyelocyte → Band neutrophil → Segmented neutrophil
- Stimulating Hormones: G-CSF, GM-CSF, Interleukins (IL-1, IL-3, IL-5, and IL-6)

#### Monopoese

- Duration: approx. 8 days
- Development steps: CMP → CFU-G/M → Monoblast → Promonocyte → Monocyte (→ Macrophages, maturation occurs only in the target organ)
- Stimulating Hormones: GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-3
- Special cells
    - Monoblast
        - First own precursor cell of the monopoly
        - Cannot be distinguished from myeloblasts in the bone marrow smear.
    - Monocyte
        - Largest cell in the blood smear (about 15 μm in diameter!)
        - Bean-shaped nucleus and a lot of granule-containing cytoplasm
        - Tires in the tissue to macrophages and osteoclasts

#### Lymphopoiesis

- B-cell series
    - Localization: The antigen-independent proliferation as well as the maturation of B lymphocytes occurs in the red bone marrow. However, the final differentiation process to the naive B cell takes place in the secondary lymphatic organs.
    - Duration: Variable
    - Development Steps: Lymphoid Progenitor Cell (CLP) → Pro-B Lymphocyte → Pre-B Lymphocyte → Immature B Lymphocyte → Mature (= naive) B Lymphocyte
    - Stimulating Hormones: Several Interleukins
- T-cell series
    - Localizations: Both the initial cell divisions of the lymphoid stem cells and the determination to precursors of the T-cell lineage occur (as with the B-cell lineage) in the bone marrow. Immediately after that, however, the pro-T cells migrate to the thymus via the bloodstream.
    - Duration: Variable
    - Development steps
        - Bone marrow: Lymphoid progenitor cell (CLP) → Pro-T-lymphocyte
        - Thymus: Pro-T-lymphocyte → Pre-T-lymphocyte → Double positive T-cell precursor → Naive CD4+ T-lymphocyte OR naive CD8+ T-lymphocyte
    - Stimulating Hormones: Several Interleukins

> [!NOTE]
> While B cells mostly complete their maturation in the bone marrow (B lymphocytes - Bone marrow), immature T lymphocytes migrate to the thymus for maturation (T lymphocytes - Thymus).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Bone Marrow and Blood Formation
### Bone Marrow

Describe the essential microscopic differences between red and yellow bone marrow.
- In bone marrow, one can already distinguish macroscopically the red, hematopoietically active marrow from the yellow, hematopoietically inactive fatty marrow. Microscopically, hematopoietic cells (e.g., erythroblasts and megakaryocytes) clearly predominate in red bone marrow compared to the fat cells (=adipocytes), which appear as individual bright, round vacuoles. In yellow bone marrow, however, fat cells dominate.
### Blood Formation

In which three phases can prenatal hematopoiesis be divided?
- Prenatal hematopoiesis begins approximately from the third week of pregnancy in the wall of the yolk sac (the so-called extraembryonic phase). The hepatolienal phase lasts roughly from the 6th week of gestation until the 4th month of development; hematopoiesis occurs mainly in the liver and to a lesser extent in the spleen of the fetus. From about the 5th month of development, hematopoiesis takes place - just as later in a healthy adult - in the red bone marrow.
What characterizes megakaryocytes? Which hormone stimulates their formation and where is it synthesized?
- Megakaryocytes are precursor cells of platelets, whose formation and differentiation are stimulated by the hormone thrombopoietin synthesized by the liver. They are characterized by a particularly large nucleus (= "megakaryo") with a polyploid set of chromosomes. The final platelets are formed by the pinching off of granule-containing, nucleus-free cytoplasmic portions of the megakaryocytes.
Name the individual steps of granulopoiesis using the example of the segmented neutrophil.
- Granulocytes arise from the myeloid progenitor cell (Common Myeloid Precursor = CMP). This differentiates into the common precursor cell of granulocytes and monocytes, the CFU-G/M (= colony-forming unit), which, in turn, matures through the developmental stages myeloblast → promyelocyte → myelocyte → metamyelocyte to the band neutrophil. By segmenting the nuclear sections, the segmented neutrophil develops from the band neutrophil.
How are macrophages formed?
- Macrophages belong to the mononuclear phagocyte system and arise from the myeloid progenitor cell (Common Myeloid Precursor = CMP). This differentiates into the common precursor cell of granulocytes and monocytes, the CFU-G/M (= colony-forming unit), which matures through the developmental stages monoblast and promonocyte to the monocyte. Monocytes leave the red bone marrow into the bloodstream and mature into macrophages after migrating into peripheral tissue.
