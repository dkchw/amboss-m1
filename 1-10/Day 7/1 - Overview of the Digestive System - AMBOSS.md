# Overview of the Digestive System
## Summary

The term "digestive system" encompasses the organs that serve to take in, break down, transport, and convert food into usable nutrients (= assimilate). In addition, the digestive system includes the glands (salivary glands, gastric glands, intestinal glands, pancreatic glands, liver) that secrete their substances into the digestive tract, thereby assisting in the breakdown of food. Topographically, the digestive tract is divided into a head and a trunk intestine, the latter of which is characterized in its various sections (i.e., esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine) by a common histological basic structure consisting of tunica mucosa, tela submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica serosa (in intraperitoneal organs) or tunica adventitia (in extra- and retroperitoneal organs). By the way, you will find a Histo Trainer episode on the topics of esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestine in the section on microscopic anatomy.

## Path of Nourishment

The food is taken in through the mouth and mechanically broken down there by the teeth and partly by the tongue. Additionally, saliva is added to the food in the mouth, which improves the food's slip and adds an enzyme (amylase) that splits carbohydrates. The food pulp moves from the oral cavity into the pharynx and is then directed into the esophagus. This serves as a pure transport route and carries the food further into the stomach, where enzymatic breakdown begins. The subsequent path leads into the small intestine, where the absorption of nutrients takes place. The final stretch is formed by the large intestine with its various sections, which thickens the food pulp, stores indigestible food components, and controls excretion (= defecation).

## Digestive Secretions

On the way through the gastrointestinal tract, many different digestive secretions are added to the food pulp. These come from the salivary glands, the gastric glands, the glands of the exocrine pancreas, and the liver, as well as from the small intestine glands. In total, about 8 liters of digestive secretions are produced each day.

## Common Histology of the Trunk Intestine

The different sections of the trunk intestine have a common histological basic structure, although there are regional differences depending on the specific function of the organ. However, the following structure is common to them (from the inside out):

- Mucous membrane (= mucosa)
    - Epithelial layer of the mucosa
    - Lamina propria mucosae
    - Muscularis mucosae layer
- Submucosal layer: With the submucosal plexus and larger blood and lymph vessels as well as nerves to supply the mucosa, it contains glands in certain areas (e.g. Gll. oesophageae; duodenal Brunner glands)
- Muscularis layer
    - Inner: Stratum circulare (= circular muscle layer)
    - Middle: Myenteric plexus
    - Outside: Longitudinal stratum (= Longitudinal muscle layer)
- Serous tunic with subserosal layer (in intraperitoneal organs) or adventitia (in extra- and retroperitoneal organs)

> [!NOTE]
> With the exception of the esophagus and the anal canal, the epithelium of the mucous membrane is a simple columnar epithelium!

> [!NOTE]
> The permeability of the tight junctions decreases from proximal to distal. While dense epithelium is found in the colon (→ low ion permeability, high transepithelial electrical resistance), loose epithelium predominates in the jejunum (→ high ion permeability, low transepithelial electrical resistance). Accordingly, the paracellular influx of electrolytes is facilitated in the jejunum (absorption of nutrients), while it hardly occurs in the colon (absorption of water and electrolytes is influenced among others by the RAAS system)!

## Control of Gastrointestinal Motility

The enteric nervous system is characterized by an intramural nervous system in its wall, which is referred to as the enteric plexus or enteric nervous system. The enteric nervous system is divided into two plexuses, the submucosal plexus (= Meissner plexus) and the myenteric plexus (= Auerbach plexus). Additionally, the so-called interstitial cells of Cajal (= ICC) play an important role as pacemakers for the motility of the enteric tract. Furthermore, enteroendocrine cells and the autonomic nervous system are also important for the complicated functional processes of the gastrointestinal tract.

### Neural Mechanisms

#### Enteric Nervous System (= Intramural Nervous System)

The enteric nervous system has complex networks of afferent and efferent nerve fibers. It functions largely autonomously but is modulated in its basic activity by the autonomic nervous system.

|Plexus|Location|Structure|Innervation|Function|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Plexus submucosus (= Meissner plexus)|- Submucosal layer|- Ganglion-containing nerve fiber network|- Muscularis mucosae layer<br>- Glands|- Mucosal folds<br>- Secretion of glands (water and electrolytes)<br>- Regulation of intestinal blood flow to maintain its own oxygen and nutrient supply|
|Plexus myentericus (= Auerbach-Plexus)|- Muscularis layer (between circular layer and longitudinal layer)|- Ganglia that are interconnected by bundles of nerve fibers|- Muscularis layer|- Intestinal motility<br>    - Propulsive peristalsis: Sensory neurons are activated by stretching or shear stimuli, leading to reflexive contraction orally and relaxation of the circular muscle, along with contraction of the longitudinal muscle of the colon aborally → Mixing of the chyme while simultaneously transporting it aborally<br>    - Segmentation<br>    - Pendulum movements<br>    - Non-propulsive peristalsis|

> [!NOTE]
> Through the enteric nervous system, a section of the intestine that is completely separated from the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems can still perform peristaltic movements!

> [!NOTE] Opioid
> Opioids are painkillers that also bind to receptors in the cells of the enteric nervous system. Through this binding, the cells are inhibited, and the motility and secretion in the intestines are downregulated. As a side effect, constipation (i.e., obstipation) must be expected with opioid administration. However, this side effect can also be utilized, for example, in the treatment of severe diarrhea.

#### Transmitter

As transmitters and modulators, many transmitters play an important role in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility. The following table summarizes the most important ones again.

|Transmitter|Synthesis Location|Effect|
|---|---|---|
|Acetylcholine|- Parasympathetic|- Increased gastric acid production<br>- Increased secretion of pancreatic juice|
|Norepinephrine|- Sympathetic|- Decreased intestinal motility|
|Serotonin|- Enteric Nervous System|- Intestinal Motility ↑|
|ATP|- Enteric Nervous System<br>- Sympathetic|- Modulation of Gut Motility|
|Nitric oxide (NO)|- Enteric nervous system|- Gut motility ↓|
|Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (GRP)|- Parasympathetic|- Increased gastrin secretion ↑|
|Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)|- Enteric nervous system|- Secretion in the colon ↑<br>- Blood flow ↑<br>- Gastrin secretion ↓|

#### Interstitial Cells of Cajal (= ICC)

The interstitial cells of Cajal are located in the wall of the trunk intestine and function as pacemaker cells for gut motility.

- Location: Between the Tela submucosa and Tunica muscularis
    - Synaptic contact with the cells of the myenteric plexus
    - Connection to the smooth muscle cells of the tunica muscularis (Gap Junctions)
- Cell type: Specialized fibroblasts
- Reaction
    - Are spontaneously active
    - Continuously generate slow potential waves (= Slow Waves, subthreshold depolarizations)
    - Innervated by axons of the myenteric plexus → A suprathreshold depolarization occurs
    - Electrical transmission of the suprathreshold depolarization to adjacent muscle cells of the tunica muscularis
- Function: Pacemaker cells of gastrointestinal motility

> [!NOTE] Hirschsprung's disease
> In Hirschsprung's disease, there is a genetic defect that results in the absence of enteric nervous system cells and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in the large intestine. As a consequence, the muscle in the affected section of the intestine can no longer relax. Therefore, stool cannot be transported further, and the preceding sections of the intestine become severely dilated (megacolon). Affected children usually present shortly after birth with a delayed passage of meconium (the newborn's first stool). The treatment involves the removal of the affected section of the intestine.

#### Autonomic Nervous System

The enteric nervous system functions largely autonomously, but it is still connected to the autonomic nervous system through branches. This connection allows for modulation of the enteric nervous system.

- Parasympathetic connection
    - Innervation: Through branches of the vagus nerve and the pelvic splanchnic nerves
    - Transmitter
        - Switching from the 1st to the 2nd neuron: Acetylcholine
        - Transfer to the success organ: Acetylcholine
- Sympathetic connection
    - Innervation: Through the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves
    - Transmitter
        - Switching from the 1st to the 2nd neuron: Acetylcholine
        - Transfer to the success organ: Norepinephrine

> [!NOTE]
> The sympathetic connections have an inhibitory effect, while the parasympathetic connections promote secretion and motility of the trunk intestines!

#### Visceral Afferents

Nerve endings of visceral afferents are located as free ends in the organ wall and act as mechano-, chemo-, and nociceptors. They run to the CNS and lead, for example, to vagovagal reflexes.

### Humoral Mechanisms

#### Enteroendocrine Cells

The enteroendocrine cells secrete hormones that play a similarly important role in the regulation of gastrointestinal functions as the neural mechanisms do. Functionally, they resemble the cells of the Langerhans islets of the pancreas and partially cooperate with them as well. For this reason, both groups are summarized under the gastro-entero-pancreatic system (= GEP system). In addition, the enteroendocrine cells are part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (= DNES).

- Location: Scattered between the epithelial cells
- Construction
    - Broader basal pole with hormone granules
    - Narrow Apex
    - Open construction type or closed construction type
- Activation
    - Open construction type: Chemical stimuli (e.g., pH value change or chyme components)
    - Closed construction type: Physical stimuli (e.g., wall stretching)
    - General: Transmitters and neuropeptides from the autonomic nervous system and the enteric nervous system
- Hormone: Can act endocrinously (= through the bloodstream) or paracrinely (= on neighboring cells)

## Embryology of the Digestive System

### The Oral Cavity

The cavity from which the epithelium of the oral cavity develops is called the oral bud. The structures located in the oral cavity develop from all three germ layers (see tongue and teeth). Through the development of the palate, the oral cavity is separated from the nasal cavity.

- Development of the oral cavity: approximately from the 4th embryonic week
    - Invagination of the ectoderm into a primitive mouth pouch (= stomodeum)
    - Formation of a mesenchymal cushion covered by ectoderm around the oral cavity: Formation of the facial swellings (upper and lower jaw swellings)
    - Proliferation of the Epithelia
- Development of the palate: approximately from the 6th embryonic week
    - From the paired maxillary ridges, two palatine ridges grow into the oral cavity forward.
    - The palatine ridges elevate and grow medially towards each other.
    - A triangular mesenchyme plate acts as the primary palate, pushing from the ventral side between the two palatine swellings.
    - The structures merge and separate the oral cavity from the nasal cavity
    - The front two-thirds ossify into the hard palate and the back third develops into the soft palate.

#### Disruption of embryonic development

- Cleft lip and palate: Deformation due to insufficient fusion of the nasal, maxillary, and/or palatine processes → cleft formations at the actual points of union
    - Inspected four sections: lip, jaw, hard and soft palate
        - For example, the formation of a lateral cleft of the upper lip due to incomplete fusion of the nasal and maxillary swellings.

### The Intestinal Canal

#### Outline

The intestinal canal extends from the pharyngeal membrane to the cloacal membrane and is divided into four sections.

|Section|Course|
|---|---|
|1. Pharyngeal gut (Cranial part of the foregut)|- From the pharyngeal membrane to the exit of the lung bud|
|2. Caudal part of the foregut|- From the lung bud to the liver bud|
|3. Midgut|- From the liver bud to the posterior intestinal orifice (the posterior intestinal orifice corresponds to the so-called Cannon-Böhm point in adults)|
|4. Rectum|- From the hindgut opening to the cloacal membrane|

#### Basics

- Origin of the inner epithelial components: Endoderm
- Origin of connective tissue, musculature, and serosa: mesoderm
- Origin of the nerve plexus: Ectoderm (Neural crest)

#### Foregut

The pharynx, the esophagus, the stomach, and (partially) the duodenum develop from the foregut.

##### Development of the Esophagus

1. Initially, the esophageal structure is just a short tube.
2. With the stretching of the upper body half, the tube elongates.
3. The surrounding mesenchyme forms two muscle layers around the tube.

##### Development of the Stomach

1. Spindle-shaped expansion in the lower section of the foregut
2. Faster growth of the posterior wall of the gastric structure: the greater and lesser curvatures arise.
3. The stomach structure rotates 90° around its longitudinal axis in a clockwise direction (= stomach rotation)
    - The great curvature is shifted to the left and the small curvature to the right.
    - The left vagus nerve reaches the anterior vagal trunk on the front wall and the right vagus nerve as the posterior vagal trunk on the back wall of the stomach.
4. Stomach torsion (= second stomach rotation) around a sagittal axis
    - The cardia is displaced to the left and slightly downward.
    - The pylorus is directed to the right and slightly upward.

During embryonic development, there are two changes in position until the stomach reaches its final shape and orientation!

##### Development of the Duodenum

The duodenum develops from the hindgut of the foregut and the initial section of the midgut.

1. Strong longitudinal growth of the duodenal structure: a C-shaped loop is formed.
2. After the gastric torsion, the curvature of the loop points to the right.
    - The upper thigh becomes the pars superior.
    - The convex limb becomes the descending part.
    - The lower leg becomes the pars horizontalis.
3. At the beginning of the 2nd embryonic month, the epithelial cells proliferate so strongly that the duodenum is temporarily obliterated.
    - By the end of the 2nd month, the lumen is fully recanalized.

> [!NOTE]
> Since the duodenum arises from both the foregut and midgut, it is supplied by branches of the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery!

> [!NOTE] Duodenal atresia
> If the lumen of the duodenum is not recanalized during embryonic development, it leads to a condition known as duodenal atresia. Affected newborns typically present with bilious vomiting within the first days of life. Additionally, the upper abdomen is often distended, while the lower abdomen tends to be sunken. The treatment for duodenal atresia is through surgery.

#### Midgut

The midgut is characterized by very rapid longitudinal growth, leading to the formation of the so-called umbilical loop. During the further development of the umbilical loop, a physiological umbilical hernia occurs. Subsequently, intestinal rotation takes place.

##### Navel loop

- Cranial segment (= small intestine segment): Lower part of the duodenum, jejunum, upper part of the ileum
- Apex: The omphaloenteric duct (= vitelline duct) branches off.
- Axis: Course of the superior mesenteric artery
- Caudal limb (= colonic limb): Lower part of the ileum, cecum, ascending colon, proximal ⅔ of the transverse colon.

> [!NOTE] Meckel's diverticulum
> The omphaloenteric duct normally regresses during the 6th embryonic week. If this does not occur or happens only partially, a small pouch of the ileum remains: the so-called Meckel's diverticulum. Normally, a Meckel's diverticulum does not cause any symptoms, but it can also become inflamed or perforate.

##### Physiological Umbilical Hernia

In the further development of the umbilical loop, the growth in length is so pronounced that the intestinal loops can no longer find space in the abdominal cavity and must be temporarily relocated to the so-called umbilical coelom. This is referred to as a physiological umbilical hernia, which occurs between the 6th and 10th embryonic weeks.

- 6. Embryonic week: Physiological umbilical hernia
- 8. Embryonic week: The physiological umbilical hernia contains segments of the jejunum and colon of the umbilical loop.
- 10. Embryonic week: The structures of the physiological umbilical hernia are relocated back into the abdominal cavity.

> [!NOTE] Omphalocele (Umbilical hernia)
> Through an excessively wide umbilical ring, a persistence of the physiological umbilical hernia can occur. The intestinal loops are therefore not relocated into the abdominal cavity but remain in the umbilical cord. At birth, there is a swelling of the umbilical cord consisting of intestinal parts and mesentery, which is covered by amnion. The surgical repositioning should be performed on the newborn within 24 hours after birth.

##### Intestinal Torsion

In the course of the growth of the umbilical loop, it undergoes a rotation around its axis. In total, the rotation is 270° counterclockwise. Through this rotation, the caudal limb of the umbilical loop moves upwards (the cecum is then situated beneath the liver bud). Due to further growth in length, the cecum then moves further downwards and the ascending colon is formed.

- The first 90° of the rotation occur while the intestinal loops are in the umbilical coelom.
- The further 180° occur after the relocation back into the abdominal cavity.

#### Rectum

The rectum is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery and opens into the so-called cloaca. The cloaca is an expansion of the terminal section and serves as the common body opening for the anal and urogenital canals. The cloaca is lined with an endoderm that lies directly caudally against the ectoderm of the outer body surface. This contact zone is called the cloacal membrane. Around the 5th embryonic week, the cloaca is divided into two cavities.

From the rectum arise:

- Distal third of the transverse colon
- Descending colon
- Sigmoid colon
- Rectum
- Upper section of the anal canal

##### Separation of the Cloaca

- 4.-7. Embryonic week: In the cloaca, the urogenital septum forms, which grows from cranial towards the cloacal membrane.
    - Division into the ventrally located urogenital sinus and the dorsally located anal canal
- At the site of fusion of the cloacal membrane and the urorectal septum, the primitive septum (= primitive perineum) is formed.
- A ventral urogenital membrane and a dorsal anal membrane are now distinguished.
- End of the 8th embryonic week: The anal membrane ruptures.

> [!NOTE] Anal atresia
> In embryonic development, the anal canal is initially closed by a membrane (= anal membrane). Normally, this membrane tears at the end of the 8th embryonic week. However, if this does not occur, it leads to a condition known as anal atresia, meaning there is a lack of an opening in the anal canal. Depending on the severity, there are different treatment options (dilation, surgery).

#### Distal section of the anal canal

The lower part of the anal canal develops from an invagination of the ectoderm, which is called the "proctodeum."

## Review Questions on the Chapter Overview of the Digestive System
### Common Histology of the Trunk Intestine

Describe the common histological basic structure of the trunk intestine.
- The histological basic structure of the trunk intestine consists from inside to outside of the following layers: Tunica mucosa, Tela submucosa, Tunica muscularis and Tunica serosa (intraperitoneal) or adventitia (extra-/retroperitoneal).

What is the tela submucosa made of?
- The Tela submucosa consists of loose connective tissue with larger blood and lymph vessels as well as the nerve plexus of the Plexus submucosus (Meissner's plexus).

What is meant by the transepithelial electrical resistance of the intestinal epithelium?
- The intestinal epithelia are connected to each other by tight junctions, which close the intercellular spaces and form a paracellular barrier that regulates the transport of water and ions. The tightness of these tight junctions is measured by the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER): The more densely packed the epithelium, the higher the TEER that must be overcome during passive paracellular inflow from the intestinal lumen.

How does the permeability of the tight junctions of the intestinal epithelium for electrolytes change from proximal to distal?
- In the intestine, the permeability of the tight junctions decreases from proximal to distal, i.e. in the jejunum the passive paracellular inflow is facilitated according to its great importance for water and sodium absorption, while sodium uptake in the colon largely occurs only in a controlled manner through the cells themselves (transcellular).

### Control of Gastrointestinal Motility

What gastrointestinal side effect should be expected when administering opioids?
- Opioids inhibit motility (movability) of the intestine especially via receptors in the intestine; consequently, constipation must be expected.

What are the interstitial cells of Cajal? Describe their functioning.
- Cajal cells are located in the intestinal wall and function as autonomous pacemaker cells of intestinal motility. They continuously generate slow potential waves (slow waves) and can induce contractions of the trunk intestinal wall independently of neuronal influences via gap junctions with neighboring muscle cells.

In which genetic disorder does the absence of nerve cells in the colon lead to megacolon (massive dilation of the colon) in newborns? Which nerve plexus is affected?
- The clinical picture is Hirschsprung's disease, in which enteric nerve cells of the Plexus myentericus (= Auerbach's plexus) in the large intestine are missing (called aganglionosis). In the affected sections of the intestine, this leads to motility disorders and stenoses; the preceding sections are strongly dilated.

Where in the intestinal wall are the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus located?
- The ganglion cells of the Plexus myentericus (= Auerbach's plexus) lie at relatively regular intervals in the Tunica muscularis, more precisely between the inner circular muscle layer and the outer longitudinal muscle layer, distributed along the entire length of the digestive tract. Thus, they can act on the smooth muscle fibers of the Tunica muscularis and regulate intestinal motility.

When and from which cells is secretin secreted, and what effect does it have?
- Secretin is secreted by the enteroendocrine S cells of the small intestine to neutralize the acidic gastric juice when the pH value there falls below 4. It stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate and water in the pancreas, bile ducts, and duodenal glands.

What effect does motilin have on gastrointestinal motility?
- Motilin leads to an increase in gastric motility and acceleration of gastric emptying.

To which cell type do ECL cells (enterochromaffin-like cells) belong and what function do they have?
- ECL cells are neuroendocrine cells of the gastric mucosa that secrete histamine and thereby increase gastric acid production in the parietal cells.

Which mechanism in the intestine leads to a better metabolism of carbohydrates upon their intake?
- Carbohydrates or glucose in the lumen of the intestine stimulate the secretion of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) by the so-called L cells of the small and large intestine. GLP1 in turn stimulates insulin secretion in the beta cells of the pancreas, which enhances glucose utilization and uptake of glucose into the cells.

What causes the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) and what are its target organs?
- The release of CCK from the I cells of the duodenum is stimulated by the contact of the cells with fats in the food. Its target organs are the gallbladder (contraction and emptying ↑, cholecystokinin literally means "gallbladder mover"), stomach (acid secretion ↓), and pancreas (enzyme secretion ↑).

### Embryology of the Digestive System

Through what and in which section of the intestine does a Meckel's diverticulum arise?
- A Meckel's diverticulum is a small outpouching of the ileum that can arise due to missing or incomplete regression of the ductus omphaloentericus during embryonic development.

At what point during embryonic development does a physiological umbilical hernia occur?
- The physiological umbilical hernia exists between the 6th and 10th embryonic week when the length growth of the intestinal loops is so pronounced that there is not enough space in the abdominal cavity and therefore a displacement of intestinal parts into the so-called umbilical coelom is necessary.
