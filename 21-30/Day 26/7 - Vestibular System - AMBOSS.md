# Vestibular System
## Summary

The equilibrium organ is part of the inner ear along with the auditory organ and is located in the petrous bone. It consists of two components: one part is formed by the so-called macula organs, which are responsible for detecting linear accelerations, and the other part consists of the semicircular canals, which perceive angular accelerations. The perception of these two changes occurs through a special sensory epithelium with characteristic hair cells, on the surface of which are sensory hairs. The adequate stimulus for sensory perception is the shearing of these very sensory hairs.

In the context of signal transmission (so-called mechanoelectric transduction), a receptor potential is generated from the mechanical shear movement. Characteristically, the hair cell already exhibits spontaneous activity at rest, which is either inhibited or enhanced depending on the direction of shear of the cilia – and thus depending on the direction of rotation or the magnitude of linear acceleration.

A large part of the vestibular information flows together with afferents from the visual and tactile systems into the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. The processed information is then sent to different areas of the brain and to the spinal cord. Among other things, the vestibular nuclei also project to the ocular motor nuclei, thereby enabling control of visual perception during head movements.
## Overview of the Vestibular Labyrinth System

The vestibular labyrinth system is located in the temporal bone and consists of the macula and semicircular canal organs. In addition to this functional classification (macula and semicircular canal organs), there is also a morphological division of the inner ear into a bony and a membranous labyrinth. The bony part corresponds to a bony canal system in the temporal bone and envelops the membranous part. The membranous part consists of membranous sacs and ducts that contain the receptor organs. The components that belong to the bony and membranous parts are listed in the table.

|Vestibular Labyrinth|Bony Labyrinth|Membranous Labyrinth (within the bony labyrinth)|

## Macula Organs (Saccule and Utricle)

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Macular Organs

The two macula organs sacculus (= anterior vestibular sac) and utricle (= posterior vestibular sac) are components of the membranous labyrinth. They are surrounded by the perilymphatic space and are located in the vestibulum of the labyrinth, a bony cavity situated between the semicircular canals and the cochlea. The sensory fields of the sacculus and utricle have a characteristic structure and detect vertical and horizontal linear accelerations.

#### Profile

- Function: Perception of linear acceleration and changes in the body's position in space
- Location: In the Vestibule of the labyrinth

#### Structure of the bony labyrinth

The bony labyrinth of the vestibular organ consists of the vestibulum labyrinthi and the semicircular canals. The vestibulum serves as the bony atrium to the semicircular canals, where the sacculus and utricle are located. From the medial wall of the vestibulum, the aqueductus vestibularis extends, leading to the posterior surface of the petrous bone. It contains the ductus endolymphaticus.

- Vestibule of the labyrinth
    - Description: Egg-shaped bony cavity containing the Saccule and Utricle
    - Connections
        - Forward: Cochlea
        - To the back: Semicircular canals
- Vestibular aqueduct
    - Description: Small bony canal that contains the endolymphatic duct
    - Connection: Draws from the vestibule to the posterior surface of the temporal bone

#### Structure of the membranous labyrinth

Sacculus and Utriculus are membranous cavities filled with endolymph. Both communicate with the subarachnoid space of the brain, the cochlear duct, as well as with each other.

|Macula Organs|Description|Location in the Inner Ear|Perceived Movement|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sacculus|- Anterior atrial sac<br>    - Shape: Spherical sac<br>    - Size: About 2 mm|- In an upright position, the longitudinal axis of the Sacculus has a vertical orientation|- Vertical linear acceleration|
|Utricle|- Posterior Sacculus<br>    - Shape: Elongated tube<br>    - Size: About 3 mm|- In an upright position, the longitudinal axis of the Utricle has a horizontal course|- Horizontal linear acceleration|

> [!NOTE]
> Sacculus and Utriculus are positioned perpendicular to each other!

##### Connections

The individual areas of the membranous labyrinth are connected to each other through small channels.

- Reunited duct
    - Connects: Sacculus with Cochlear duct
- Ductus utriculosaccularis
    - Connects: Utricle with Saccule
    - Exits: Endolymphatic duct
- Endolymphatic duct
    - Connects: Ductus utriculosaccularis with Saccus endolymphaticus
    - Discharges: Ends blindly in the endolymphatic sac
- Endolymphatic sac
    - Short description: Expanded blind pouch located beneath the dura mater of the posterior surface of the temporal bone

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Macula Organs

Within the macula organs, there are small areas that serve sensory perception. These are referred to as sensory fields (or Maculae staticae). They consist of a sensory epithelium and an overlying otolith membrane with embedded otoliths.

- Sensory fields: Spot-like areas within the macula and semicircular canals that serve sensory perception.
    - Macula sacculi: Sensory fields of the Saccule
    - Macula utriculi: Sensory fields of the utricle

#### The polarization of hair cells within a macula organ

- The cells of a macula organ are divided into two different groups by a so-called striola.
    - In Utriculus: Polarization of the cells towards the striola
    - In Sacculus: Polarization of the cells against the striola
- There are two types of hair cells that differ morphologically; the functional difference between the two cell types has not yet been sufficiently clarified.
    - Hair Cell Type 1
        - Form: Bottle-shaped cell body, thin neck
        - Innervation: Afferent nerve fibers from the vestibular nerve
    - Hair Cell Type 2
        - Form: Cylindrical cell body
        - Innervation: Afferent and efferent nerve fibers from the vestibular nerve
## Semicircular Canals (Ductus semicirculares)

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Semicircular Canals

There are three semicircular canals, which are oriented at right angles to each other and detect angular accelerations. Each semicircular canal consists of a membranous semicircular canal tube that is surrounded by a bony semicircular canal. The space between the membranous and bony semicircular canal contains perilymph and is therefore also referred to as the perilymphatic space.

#### Profile

- Function: Perception of angular acceleration
- Location
    - Within the petrous part of the temporal bone (= pars petrosa ossis temporalis)
    - The three arcades are perpendicular to each other.
- Form: C-shaped hose system
- Size: The length varies between 15 and 22 mm

#### Structure

The bony semicircular canals each form a C-shaped arch. All three semicircular canals open into a common bony cavity, the vestibulum labyrinthi. Near this junction, each semicircular canal has a bony dilation known as an ampulla, which contains specialized areas for sensory perception.

##### Bony Labyrinth

- Three semicircular canals
    - Anterior Semicircular Canal
    - Posterior Semicircular Canal
    - Lateral Semicircular Canal
- Features
    - Variable length (15–22 mm)
    - Each possesses a vial: Bony expansion
        - Anterior ampulla
        - Posterior ampulla
        - Lateral ampulla
- Function: Sheath the membranous semicircular canals

##### Membranous Labyrinth

|Semicircular Canals|Location in the Inner Ear|Perceived Movement|
|---|---|---|
|Anterior semicircular canal (= Ductus semicircularis anterior)|- The anterior and posterior semicircular canals form an angle that opens laterally<br>- Both deviate by 45° from the median- and frontal plane|- Vertical head movement|
|Posterior semicircular canal (= Ductus semicircularis posterior)|- Lateral head tilt<br>- E.g. through the Hallpike maneuver|
|Lateral semicircular canal (= Ductus semicircularis lateralis)|- Nearly horizontally oriented<br>- Deviates 30° downward and backward from the horizontal plane|- Horizontal head movement<br>- When the head is turned to the left, the left semicircular organs are activated and the right ones are inhibited|

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Semicircular Canals

The sensory fields of the semicircular canals are located in the ampullae and are called Cristae ampullares. They have a similar structure to the sensory fields of the macular organs with a sensory epithelium and a gel-like layer above it.

- Ampullary crests
    - Definition: Sensory fields of the semicircular canals
    - Location: In the ampoules of the semicircular canals

> [!NOTE]
> The cupula does not have otoliths unlike the otolithic membrane, has the same specific weight as the surrounding endolymph, and is anchored on both sides to the ampoule wall!

## Function of the Vestibular Organ

The vestibular organ collects information about motion and spatial orientation and transmits it in the form of electrical signals to the CNS. The semicircular canals detect rotational accelerations, whereas the macula organs sense linear accelerations and spatial orientation.

### Function of the Macula Organs

- Perception of linear acceleration (dynamic function)
    1. Linear Acceleration (e.g., accelerating in a car)
    2. Displacement of the otolithic membrane
        - The density of the otoliths in the gelatinous layer is greater than that of the surrounding endolymph.
        - Due to mass inertia, there is a displacement of the otolith membrane over the sensory epithelium.
    3. Directed shear of the sensory hairs
    4. Adequate stimulus for the hair cell
    5. Activation or inhibition of the hair cell (see next subsection)
- Determination of the body's position (Static function)
    1. Change in head position (e.g. lateral tilting)
    2. Displacement of the otolithic membrane
        - Due to Earth's gravity, humans are subjected to a constant gravitational acceleration (gravity).
        - In a normal head position while standing, the macula utriculi is largely horizontal.
        - When the head is tilted to the side, the gravity shifts the heavy otolith membrane slightly above the sensory epithelium.
    3. Directed shear of the sensory hairs
    4. Adequate stimulus for the hair cell
    5. Activation or inhibition of the hair cell (see next subsection)

> [!NOTE]
> The macula utriculi is positioned horizontally in an upright head position and detects horizontal linear accelerations! The macula sacculi is oriented vertically and perceives vertical linear accelerations!

### Function of the Semicircular Canals

- Perception of angular acceleration
    1. Rotational acceleration (e.g., on a swivel chair)
    2. Deflection of the Cupula
        - The Cupula is anchored in the wall of the arcade.
        - The endolymph has a lower density than the bony boundaries of the semicircular canal (but the same as the cupula).
        - In a rotational movement of the head, the sluggish endolymph moves more slowly than the (surrounding) bony semicircular canal.
        - Since the cupola is firmly anchored to the arch wall, it is thus (passively) deflected in the opposite direction.
    3. Directed shear of the sensory hairs
    4. Adequate stimulus for the hair cell
    5. Activation or inhibition of the hair cell (see next subsection)
## Peripheral vestibular perception

The deflection of the stereocilia is the appropriate stimulus for the vestibular hair cells. They have the unique ability to convert this mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal, which they then transmit to the afferent fibers of the N. vestibularis. Depending on the direction of shear of the cilia - and thus depending on the direction of rotation and movement - the nerve is either inhibited or increasingly excited. This process is referred to as mechanical-electrical transduction.

### Hair Cell at Rest

In rest, there is no displacement of the gelatinous layer and the nerve fiber has a spontaneous resting activity.

1. Gelatinous layer in the middle position
2. Stereocilia stand upright.
3. Spontaneous Rest Activity
4. Constant transmitter release (Glutamate)

> [!NOTE]
> Even without deflection of the stereocilia, a constant release of neurotransmitters occurs, resulting in the afferent nerve having a high "spontaneous resting activity"!

### Sequence of Hair Cell Activation

In the course of the gelatinous layer towards the kinocilium, an increase in action potentials can be measured in the afferent nerve.

1. Stereocilia are deflected towards the kinocilium
2. "Tip links" at the top of the stereocilia are stretched → opening additional mechanical transduction channels
3. Influx of endolymphatic K+ from the endolymph into the hair cell
4. Depolarization
5. Opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels: Ca2+ influx increases
6. Increase in transmitter release (glutamate) in the synaptic cleft
7. Increase in nerve action potentials

> [!NOTE]
> The opening of the transduction channels leads to an influx of K+ into the hair cell, resulting in a depolarization!

### Sequence of Hair Cell Inhibition

In the direction of the gel layer opposite to the kinocilium, a decrease in action potentials in the afferent nerve can be measured.

1. Deflection of the stereocilia in the opposite direction of the kinocilium
2. Relaxation of the "tip links" at the top of the stereocilia
3. Mechanical transduction channels are closed.
4. Endolymphatic K+ influx into the hair cell decreases
5. Hyperpolarization
6. Voltage-dependent calcium channels close: Ca2+ influx decreases
7. Measurement of transmitter release (Glutamate) in the synaptic cleft
8. Recording of nerve action potentials

> [!NOTE] Menieres disease  
> Menière's disease is a condition of the inner ear, characterized by the symptom triad of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. It is associated with an increase in the fluid of the endolymph. There is a theory that it occurs due to a rupture in the Reissner's membrane and subsequently leads to the mixing of potassium-rich (and sodium-poor) endolymph with sodium-rich (and potassium-poor) perilymph. The pathologically increased potassium concentration in the perilymph leads to the depolarization of the afferent auditory nerve fibers and consequently to the acute symptoms of Menière's disease.

## Central vestibular circuitry

About the N. vestibulocochlearis (VIII. cranial nerve), the excitations of the hair cells of the vestibular organ are transmitted to the CNS. In the medulla oblongata, there are four vestibular nuclei located bilaterally. They are the central summation and integration center of the vestibular system. In addition to vestibular information, they also receive afferents from the visual and somatosensory systems. After the information has been processed here, the vestibular nuclei send efferent fibers to several regions of the brain and the spinal cord. Additionally, the vestibular nuclei also communicate with each other via specialized commissural fibers.

### Pathway of Central Vestibular Connections

| |Wiring|Special Feature|
|---|---|---|
|Receptor organ|- Vestibular hair cells in semicircular canals and macula organs: Form synapses with the bipolar neurons of the vestibular ganglion → Relay to the 1st neuron|- Secondary sensory cells|
|1. Neuron (= N. vestibularis)|- Vestibular ganglion: Perikarya of the 1st neuron|- Located in the internal auditory canal in the temporal bone|
|2. Neuron|- Vestibular nuclei: Input to the 2. Neuron|- Exception: Some fibers of the N. vestibularis also project directly (via the inferior cerebellar peduncle) to the cerebellum and are not relayed in the vestibular nuclei|

### Vestibular Nuclei

In the medulla oblongata, there is a core complex on both sides that consists of four vestibular nuclei each.

- Superior vestibular nucleus (= Bechterew nucleus)
- Nucleus vestibularis medialis (= Schwalbe nucleus)
- Inferior vestibular nucleus (= Roller nucleus)
- Ncl. vestibularis lateralis (= Deiters nucleus)

### Function of the Vestibular Nuclei

- Afferents of the Vestibular nuclei
    - Vestibular apparatus
    - Visual System
    - Proprioceptive System

> [!NOTE]
> Isolated afferents from the vestibular ganglion also project directly via the inferior cerebellar peduncle to the cerebellum (flocculonodular lobe), without being relayed in the vestibular nuclei (= direct sensory cerebellar tract).

### Interconnection of the individual Vestibular nuclei

The four vestibular nuclei each have different afferents and efferents:

|Core|Afferent|Efferent|
|---|---|---|
|Superior vestibular nucleus|- Semicircular canals|- Via the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the extraocular muscles|
|Ncl. vestibularis medialis|- Semicircular canals|- Through the medial longitudinal fasciculus to extraocular muscles<br>- Additional fibers to the cervical muscles|
|Ncl. vestibularis lateralis|- Predominantly from the cerebellum|- Via the lateral vestibulospinal tract to motoneurons responsible for the toning of extensor muscles|
|Ncl. vestibularis inferior|- Saccule and Utricle|- Particularly to the Cerebellum|

> [!NOTE] Vertigo
> The central vestibular system constantly compares the normally precisely coordinated vestibular, visual, and somatosensory afferents. If there is an acute or chronic imbalance ("mismatch"), a multisensory misperception can occur. This is subjectively perceived as dizziness.

## Central Vestibular System and Oculomotor Function

The central vestibular system (specifically the vestibular nuclei) is responsible for coordinating visual perception during head movements, among other tasks. There are vestibular pathways to the ocular motor nuclei that facilitate communication between the vestibular system and ocular motility. This connection is referred to as the vestibulo-ocular reflex and plays a crucial role in clinical functional examinations of the vestibular system.

### Vestibulo-ocular Reflex (VOR)

- Definition
    - Brainstem reflex for maintaining gaze stability
    - When the head is turned, there is a reflexive counteracting eye movement at approximately the same speed
        - Sog. Doll's Head Phenomenon
    - Special feature: Voluntarily suppressible
- Testing: Head Impulse Test
    - The patient is asked to fixate on a fixed point (e.g., the nose of the examiner)
    - The examiner takes the patient's head in both hands and quickly rotates it about 30° to the right and left.
    - Physiological: The rotation is immediately compensated by an eye movement.
    - Pathological: Failure of compensatory eye movement (comatose patient) or reset saccade (alert patient)
- Reflex connection
    - Activate ipsilateral vestibular nuclei.
    - Fibers from the vestibular nuclei to the ocular muscle nuclei run crossed.
        - 1. Crossing: Fibers from the vestibular nucleus to the contralateral abducens nucleus → Activation of the contralateral lateral rectus muscle
        - 2. Crossing: Fibers from the abducens nucleus to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus → Activation of the ipsilateral M. rectus medialis

> [!NOTE] Brain Death Diagnosis  
> The VOR is used, among other things, in brain death diagnostics. Since it is processed in the brainstem and not cortically, it can also be tested in unconscious individuals to assess brainstem function. In the event of damage in this area, the compensatory eye movement is absent during passive head rotation.

### Nystagmus

In a nystagmus, there are rhythmic, involuntary oscillating eye movements. They consist of a slow gaze movement (aimed at stabilizing the representation of an object on the retina) and a quick resetting movement in the opposite direction. By definition, the direction of nystagmus is named after this quick phase. A nystagmus can be triggered by persistent signals from the vestibular organs that detect actual head acceleration, or by pathological signals from the vestibular organs that suggest a non-existent head acceleration. Furthermore, persistent movement of the visually captured environment can also lead to a nystagmus. Thus, physiological and pathological nystagmus are distinguished.

- Characteristics
    - Direction of beat: Horizontal nystagmus, upbeat nystagmus, downbeat nystagmus, torsional nystagmus
    - Temporal dynamics: frequency, rhythm, latency
    - Triggerability
        - Through provocation, e.g., during changes in gaze direction, position or posture provocation
        - Already at rest (Spontaneous nystagmus)
- Frenzel glasses: Special glasses used as an instrument for the examination of nystagmus
    - Construction: Magnifying glasses (15 dpt) and small lamps for illuminating the eyes
    - Function: Abolishment of the ability to fixate and better visibility of eye movements (magnification)
- Nystagmogram: Graphical representation of a nystagmus
    - Methods
        - Electronystagmography
        - Videonystagmography

> [!NOTE]
> As a rule of thumb: The nystagmus beats toward the more excited labyrinth! If the nystagmus beats to the right, there is either an under-excitation of the left vestibular organ or an over-excitation of the right vestibular organ!

#### Physiological Nystagmus

- Pre- and postrotatory nystagmus
    - Definition: Nystagmus, which occurs due to the rotation of the body
    - Background
        - Through rotational movement, the endolymph is accelerated, leading to nystagmus in the direction of the rotation.
        - If the rotational movement is suddenly stopped, nystagmus is triggered in the opposite direction (so-called postrotatory nystagmus)
    - Provocation procedure: Swivel chair test using the Frenzel goggles
- Optokinetic nystagmus (Railway nystagmus)
    - Definition: Oculomotor correction process for stabilizing images of a moving visual environment on the retina
    - Provocation procedure: Tested with a nystagmus drum or a strip band.
    - Principle
        - Shifting the image position beyond the edge of the field of view
        - Slow follow-up movement in the same direction to stabilize the image on the retina
        - Quick saccade to bring the eye axis back to its original position against the direction of the stimulus

#### Pathological Nystagmus

Pathological forms of nystagmus can occur spontaneously or after provocation. If nystagmus occurs spontaneously (i.e., without an eliciting stimulus such as a rotational movement), it is always a pathological nystagmus.

- Peripheral
    - Mostly associated with dizziness and nausea
    - Generally less variable in direction and rhythm
    - Suppressible through fixation
    - Cause: Vestibular imbalance due to a vestibular injury
- Central
    - Often without vegetative accompanying symptoms
    - Direction and rhythm often more variable
    - Not suppressible through fixation
- Examples
    - Spontaneous nystagmus
        - Central or peripheral conditioned
        - Appearance without provocation in a resting state
        - Direction of strike remains consistent regardless of the line of sight.
    - Gaze-evoked nystagmus
        - Central caused (cerebellum- or brainstem-lesion)
        - Occurrence when the gaze is diverted
        - Strikes quickly in the respective line of sight
        - Amplitude possibly increasing with greater deviation of the gaze

#### Caloric Testing

- Principle: Testing the excitability of the vestibular system through defined thermal stimulation
    - Heating causes a liquid expansion and thereby reduces the specific density of the endolymph
    - Flow of the warmed endolymph over the cupula, which leads to the desired stimulus activation.
- Implementation
    - Patient is lying on a stretcher with the upper body elevated at 30°.
    - Flushing of the upper external ear canal with warm and cold air streams or water
    - Observing eye movements to detect the occurring nystagmus using a Frenzel glasses
    - Warm stimulation: Nystagmus to the irritated ear
    - Cold irritation: Nystagmus to the opposite side
- Pathological: Side difference
## Body Balance and Vestibular Nuclei

Stabilizing reflexes stabilize the body's equilibrium. The motoneurons for this are located in the spinal cord and are controlled by descending supraspinal pathways. The origin of these pathways includes the vestibular nuclei from the brainstem. For target motor control, there are dorsolateral pathways that originate from the red nucleus.

### Ventromedial Pathway for Postural Motor Control

- Function: Stabilization of body posture and calculation of overall body posture
- Shares
    - Lateral vestibulospinal tract (originating from the lateral vestibular nucleus): Increase in extensor tone, control of postural motor skills
    - Medial vestibulospinal tract (originating from the medial vestibular nucleus): control of head position, neck reflexes, coordination of eye movements
    - Reticulospinal tract (originating from the reticular formation): Modulation of postural motor control (excitation of proximal motoneurons)
- Muscle reflexes: Maintain balance and thus enable upright walking.
    - Static Reflexes
        - Stretch reflex: Control of muscle tone to adopt certain body positions (e.g., standing, bent upper body)
        - Stretch reflexes: Enable returning to the normal body posture after an unusual position has been assumed.
    - Statokinetic reflexes (= movement reflexes)
        - Enable maintaining balance even while in motion
        - Example: Catching movement when tripping

### Dorsolateral Pathway for Target Motor Skills

- Function: Target motor control
- Shares
    - Rubrospinal tract (originating from the red nucleus): Activation of flexor motoneurons to distal muscle groups
    - Lateral Corticospinal Tract: Activation of Flexor Motoneurons

> [!NOTE] Decerebration Syndrome
> A decerebrate syndrome occurs with a disconnection between the brainstem and the overlying neocortex below the red nucleus. Possible causes for this can include severe brain injuries, cerebral inflammation, or poisoning. This results in the loss of inhibition of the rubrospinal tract on the extensor neurons (the rubrospinal tract activates flexor and inhibits extensor motoneurons), so that the excitation from the lateral vestibular nucleus predominates (vestibulospinal tract). This leads to a spastic extension posture (referred to as decerebrate rigidity).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Vestibular System
### Semicircular Canals (Ductus Semicirculares)

What type of head movement is perceived by the lateral semicircular canals? When is the right-sided and when is the left-sided semicircular canal activated?
- The lateral semicircular canals perceive horizontal movements of the head (shaking the head), whereby the nerve fibers of the left and right canals are activated oppositely. When turning the head to the left, the left semicircular canal organs are activated and the right ones inhibited. When turning the head to the right, accordingly the right semicircular canal organs are activated and the left ones inhibited.
What are the cupulae ampullares and what is their function?
- The cupulae ampullares are part of the cristae ampullares, the sensory fields of the semicircular canals. They are a gelatinous layer lying on top of the sensory epithelium of the semicircular canals. Both the sensory epithelium and the cupula are located within a bony enlargement of the semicircular canals, the so-called ampulla.
### Peripheral vestibular perception

How do the hair cells behave when lying down with a calm head position?
- The hair cells of the semicircular canal organs have so-called spontaneous resting activity. This means that even when lying down despite no deflection of the stereocilia, transmitters (glutamate) are continuously released and action potentials are triggered in the vestibular nerve.
Where are the perikarya of the 1st neuron of the central vestibular circuitry located?
- The perikarya of the 1st neuron of the central vestibular circuitry (= vestibular nerve), whose fibers receive signals from the hair cells, are located in the vestibular ganglion in the internal auditory canal in the petrous bone. The synapse onto the 2nd neuron then occurs in the vestibular nuclei in the medulla oblongata.
### Central Vestibular System and Oculomotor Function

What effects does an acute failure of the left vestibular organ have?
- In the event of failure of the left vestibular organ, the activity of the right vestibular organ predominates. The brain interprets this activity as a head turn to the right and reacts with nystagmus to the right side (vestibulo-ocular reflex). Moreover, dizziness and nausea usually occur.
What is the so-called perrotatory nystagmus?
- The perrotatory nystagmus is a physiological nystagmus caused by rotation of the body (e.g., on a rotating chair). Through the rotational movement, the endolymph is accelerated and, due to the vestibulo-ocular reflex, nystagmus in the direction of rotation is triggered. If the rotational movement is suddenly stopped, the nystagmus reverses in the opposite direction (the so-called postrotatory nystagmus).
