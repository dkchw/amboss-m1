# Dealing with Dying
## Summary

End-of-life care (palliative medicine) is, alongside healing diseases, also part of a doctor's profession. In these unfortunate situations, it is particularly important that neither the patient nor the doctor feels alone or poorly informed. An adequate and trustworthy interaction is essential for both sides.

In the context of dying and mourning, Kübler-Ross's phase model has gained significant recognition. The psychiatrist defined different phases that are characteristic of the process of dying or grieving.
## Stages of Dying According to Kübler-Ross

The psychiatrist Kübler-Ross developed a model of stages for dealing with dying in 1969. She assumes that processing for most dying individuals occurs in certain phases. However, the progression of these phases can vary greatly on an individual basis - both in intensity and in order. Additionally, not all phases necessarily have to be experienced: The individual phases can be revisited multiple times or can occur simultaneously.

- Phase of defense and denial
    - The dying person denies the impending death.
- Phase of the Protests
    - The dying person feels anger and rage
    - Anger and wrath can also be directed towards relatives and caregivers.
- Negotiation phase
    - The dying person tries everything to postpone death and negotiates with their doctors or with God.
- Phase of sadness
    - The dying person experiences feelings of sadness and depression when they realize that death cannot be postponed.
- Phase of Acceptance
    - After anger and sadness have been overcome, the dying person can accept their impending death and find peace.
## Grief Work and Grief Reaction

The death of a person is often a significant burden for relatives and needs to be processed over time. This physiological process is referred to as normal grief reaction. However, it can also lead to an abnormal grief reaction, which usually results in those affected needing professional help to cope with the (impending) death of the relative.

- Normal grief reaction
    - Normal reaction to loss
    - Process of processing
    - Individually very different
- Abnormal grief reaction
    - Can emerge from the normal grieving response.
    - Differs from the normal mourning reaction through an exaggerated intensity, a longer duration, and an unusual nature.
    - Professional help is usually needed to overcome the abnormal grief reaction

> Grieving individuals are indeed capable of feeling joy as well! This can be used as an important distinguishing feature from a depression.

> At many stations, so-called liaison services are now offered, where a psychotherapist is available for discussions with patients and relatives regardless of inquiries!

### Hospice and Palliative Medicine

When curative medicine reaches its limits as healing medicine, palliative medicine comes into play. It serves to support the dying process and aims to make dying as comfortable as possible for the patient. Hospices and outpatient hospice care are explicitly designed for palliative medicine.

- Tasks of Palliative Medicine and Hospice Work
    - Improvement of the quality of life
    - Treatment of pain
    - Psychosocial Support
    - Spiritual Guidance
    - Shaping death rituals
    - Involving the relatives

> [!NOTE] Relief from pain in palliative care  
> In the final stages of an illness, patients often suffer from pain. This can represent a significant impairment of quality of life. Since the potential for addiction is no longer a consideration in palliative care, high-dose opioid-analgesics can be used.
