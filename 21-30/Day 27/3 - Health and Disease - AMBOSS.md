# Health and Disease
## Summary

The state of health can be defined and interpreted in different ways. It is now certain that both physical, mental, and social factors have an influence on health, and that the subjective experience of illness can vary between individuals.

Environmental factors and cognitive processes also influence the perception of one's own body and well-being and can have both positive and negative effects on it. Expectations and evaluations from society can also affect the course of illness (e.g., in mental health disorders).
## Important Terms

### Definitions of Health

One distinguishes between a medical definition of health and the definition by the WHO (World Health Organization).

- Medical definition: Absence of disease
- Definition by the WHO: A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being (= Ideal standard)

### Terms Related to Illness

- Origin and development of diseases
    - Etiology: The study of the causes of a disease
    - Pathogenesis: The study of the origin and development of a disease
- Course of diseases
    - Chronifizierung: Übergang einer Erkrankung in einen dauerhaften Zustand
    - Remission: Temporary or permanent alleviation of symptoms of a disease, without achieving a complete cure.
    - Recidivism: The recurrence of a disease after it has already been cured.

#### Epidemiological Terms

Epidemiology, as a subfield of medicine, examines the distribution and frequency of diseases in a population. The following are some important epidemiological terms.

- Morbidität: Überbegriff zur Beschreibung der Häufigkeit einer Erkrankung
    - Incidence: Number of new cases of a specific disease within a given time period.
    - Prevalence: Number of affected individuals or risk factors in a specific population
        - Point prevalence: At a certain point in time
        - Period prevalence: Over a certain period of time
- Mortality: Number of all deaths within a population group
- Lethality: the ratio of the number of deaths to the total number of cases related to a disease

### Norm Concepts

Health and illness of a person can be determined based on various norms. Depending on which norm is applied, a person can thus be considered healthy or ill, or in need of treatment.

- Social Norm: Generally accepted, binding behavior guidelines in social interactions.
- Statistische Norm: Bezieht sich auf statistische Werte
- Idealnorm: Refers to an ideal state
- Funktionsnorm: Bezieht sich auf die Funktionsfähigkeit des Individuums (bspw. kann durch Krankheit die Funktionsfähigkeit bei alltäglichen Aktivitäten oder im Beruf eingeschränkt sein)
- Therapeutic norm: Describes at which value a therapy is meaningful in order to reduce the risk of subsequent diseases.

### Competing Perspectives

- Dichotomous view: A person is either "healthy" or "sick"
- Continuous consideration: The transition from "healthy" to "sick" is viewed as fluid, so that the patient is typically located at a position between sick and healthy.
## Subjektive Einschätzung

### Patient Satisfaction and Quality of Life

The patient's subjective experiences with their treatment should always be taken into account and can provide insights into the quality of medical care. The following will explain aspects of patient satisfaction as well as health-related quality of life as a subjectively perceived assessment of one's own well-being.

#### Patient Satisfaction

The following factors have a significant influence on patient satisfaction:

- Effectiveness of the therapy
- Behavior of the staff
- Perception of technical and professional competence
- Type of information regarding the procedure
- Ausstattung und Umgebung (z.B. Zimmer, Mahlzeiten)
- Ausmaß von Bürokratie und Organisation

#### Lebensqualität

The health-related quality of life is a subjectively perceived assessment of one’s well-being, which consists of the following four components in both sick and healthy individuals:

1. Physical condition (e.g. pain)
2. Mental State (e.g., Moods)
3. Social Well-Being (e.g., Quality of Friendships)
4. Funktionsfähigkeit/Funktionszustand (bspw. die Fähigkeit, normale Alltagssituationen ausführen zu können)

##### Measurement of Quality of Life Impairment

Die subjektive Einschätzung der gesundheitsbezogenen Lebensqualität kann objektiv mittels verschiedener Fragebögen gemessen werden.

- Generic questionnaires: General, disease-independent questionnaires that can be used for both patients and healthy individuals.
    - Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF 36)
        - Besteht aus 36 Fragen, die sich auf acht Bereiche beziehen
            - General health perception
            - Körperlicher Schmerz
            - Vitality
            - Körperliche Funktionsfähigkeit
            - Social functionality
            - Körperliche Rollenfunktion
            - Emotional role function
            - Psychological well-being
        - Can be conducted as a questionnaire or interview both with the patient themselves and as part of a third-party history
        - Serves to assess the health-related quality of life of both healthy and ill patients.
- Disease-specific questionnaires: Questionnaires used only for a specific condition, tailored to the situation of the affected individuals.

> [!NOTE]
> Disease-specific questionnaires can usually represent sensitivity to change, i.e. changes in the course of a disease or therapy, better than generic questionnaires!

> [!NOTE] Fatigue
> In the context of a cancer diagnosis – particularly triggered by a chemotherapy – many patients suffer from pronounced fatigue and weakness that does not improve with sleep and rest (so-called fatigue). Fatigue can also occur in the context of various chronic diseases. The symptoms are rather nonspecific and may partly overlap with the symptoms of a depression. Treatment approaches can be both physiotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic as well as pharmacological in nature.

> [!NOTE]
> The preservation or restoration of quality of life should always be the primary goal of therapy. For example, in the case of advanced-stage cancer, a maximum quality of life for the patient must be pursued, even if the condition is objectively no longer treatable!

## In Society

Gesundheit und Krankheit sind nicht nur individuell geprägte Erscheinungsformen, sondern werden auch durch die gesellschaftlichen Strukturen beeinflusst, in denen sich der Mensch befindet. Wie die Gesellschaft Individuen und Krankheit bewertet, hat so mitunter großen Einfluss auf die weitere Entwicklung eines Menschen bzw. auf den weiteren Verlauf seiner Erkrankung.

- Discrimination: Disadvantage or exclusion of individuals
- Stigmatization: Devaluing individuals and attributing negative traits (stigmas) based on characteristics or behaviors that are negatively judged within a society.
- Etikettierungsansatz (Labeling-Theorie): Sieht den Einfluss der Gesellschaft als Ursache für psychische Erkrankungen
    - Die Gesellschaft definiert, was "normal" und was "verrückt" ist und etikettiert dadurch Personen, die von der "Norm" abweichen
    - Erst durch diese Etikettierung übernimmt der Betroffene seine Rolle als psychisch Erkrankter und entwickelt die eigentliche Störung
    - However, this assumption has proven to be invalid.
        - Die Stigmatisierung durch die Gesellschaft ist vielmehr Folge der psychischen Erkrankung
        - Jedoch können die negativen Folgen der Stigmatisierung den Verlauf der Erkrankung negativ beeinflussen

### Social Psychological Influences on Health and Illness

The following presents some psychological and social influencing factors on health and illness. It is particularly important to be aware of psychosocial risk and protective factors in order to minimize risk factors as much as possible in advance of an illness, but also in cases of already existing conditions, and to strengthen protective factors.

#### Influences of the psychosocial environment

- Soziale Rollen: Alle Rollen, die von einem Menschen in der Gesellschaft erfüllt werden und in ihrer Gesamtheit eine bestimmte Verhaltenserwartung zur Folge haben.
    - Role Identification: The social role is adopted along with its expected behaviors.
    - Roll distance: A distance is established to the expected role and the role bearer questions his role.
    - Rollenkonflikte: Entstehen, wenn Rollenerwartungen nur schwer oder gar nicht miteinander zu vereinbaren sind. Hierbei wird zwischen Intrarollenkonflikt und Interrollenkonflikt unterschieden.
- Normen: Regeln, die ein bestimmtes Verhalten in der Gesellschaft fordern
    - Primäre Devianz (primäre Abweichung): Normabweichendes Verhalten
    - Sekundäre Devianz (sekundäre Abweichung): Normabweichendes Verhalten aufgrund von Erfahrungen und Stigmatisierungen durch die Gesellschaft
- Settings: Cognitive or affective evaluations by the environment regarding a specific behavior

#### Psychosoziale Risiko- und Schutzfaktoren

Es existiert eine Reihe psychosozialer Risiko- und Schutzfaktoren, die Auswirkungen auf die Entstehung und den Verlauf von Krankheiten haben und von denen im Folgenden eine Auswahl vorgestellt wird. Hierbei ist es wichtig, zu beachten, dass Risikofaktoren alleine zwar keine Erkrankung auslösen (und demnach kein monokausaler Zusammenhang zwischen Exposition und Erkrankung besteht), jedoch das Erkrankungsrisiko erhöhen. Schutzfaktoren dienen hingegen als Schutz gegenüber Krankheiten und senken das Erkrankungsrisiko.

- Psychosoziale Risikofaktoren
    - Soziale Isolation
    - Critical life events, e.g.
        - Tod einer nahestehenden Person
        - Trennung
        - Loss of work → Loss of status
- Psychosocial protective factors
    - High Resilience: Psychological and physical resilience in life crises
    - Internal Control Belief: The belief that one's own behavior can influence events in life
    - Self-efficacy expectation: The extent of the belief that one's own behavior can be implemented even under adverse circumstances
    - Dispositional optimism: The general confidence that things will develop positively, regardless of whether this happens through one's own efforts or on its own.
    - Hardiness (Robustheit): Die Fähigkeit einer Person, Veränderungen als kontrollierbar zu erleben und als Chance zu sehen
    - Experience with stress
    - Problem-solving strategies: Individual skills for coping with problems, such as performing relaxation exercises in stressful situations.
    - Soziale Integration (strukturelle Unterstützung): Zugehörigkeit zu sozialen Gruppen (auf struktureller Ebene)
    - Soziale Unterstützung: Oberbegriff für jegliche Hilfe, die eine Person beim Bewältigen von bestimmten Aufgaben aus ihrem Umfeld erfahren kann (auf funktioneller Ebene)
        - Emotionale Unterstützung: Bspw. Trost, unterstützende Gespräche
        - Instrumental support: For example, assistance in daily life, such as help with shopping
        - Informational support: For example, providing information, advice
        - Bewertungsunterstützung: Diese Form der Unterstützung erfährt das Individuum, wenn jemand anderes seine Meinung und Ansichten teilt
    - Social cohesion: The bond between members of a group
    - Social Capital: The totality of all social relationships that lead to trust in society.

> [!NOTE]
> Some studies suggest that, at an older age, high social participation and activity are more likely to lead to lower life satisfaction, as aging serves the gradual withdrawal of the individual (Disengagement Theory)!

##### Models of health-protective effects of social support

Two models are distinguished that describe the protective effects of social support.

- Stress-Puffer-Modell: Stress wird durch soziale Unterstützung abgepuffert
- Main effect model (= Main effect hypothesis): Social support generally has a positive effect, regardless of whether a person is exposed to stress or not.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Health and Illness
### Important Terms

What is the WHO definition of health? What normative concept is it based on?
- The WHO defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, i.e., not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. This is a desirable ideal state that, unfortunately, is actually rarely fully achieved and thus corresponds to an ideal norm.
What is meant by a relapse?
- If a disease reoccurs after complete healing, it is called a relapse. This term is particularly common in connection with oncological diseases.
What does incidence mean?
- Incidence describes the number of new cases of a disease occurring within a specific period in a population.
How do point prevalence and period prevalence differ?
- Prevalence generally describes the number of affected persons in a given population. If this number refers to a specific point in time, it is called point prevalence. If it refers to a period of time, it is called period prevalence.
What does the term lethality describe?
- Lethality is the ratio of all deaths to the total number of affected individuals concerning a specific disease. It describes the risk of dying from a disease.
What understanding of normality is described by a social norm?
- Social norm generally comprises commonly accepted, binding behavioral guidelines in social interactions. Non-compliance is socially sanctioned (e.g., through laws).
What is meant by functional norm?
- The characteristics or performance of an individual that serve to assess functionality (especially carrying out daily, professional, and social tasks) are summarized under the term functional norm.
Which normative concept is most closely followed by the determination of, for example, blood pressure thresholds?
- The definition of threshold values in medical diagnostics, from which treatment necessity exists to prevent possible secondary diseases, is referred to as the therapeutic norm.
### Subjective Assessment

What components describe health-related quality of life?
- Health-related quality of life is a subjective assessment of one's own well-being. It can be determined by the following four components: physical, mental, and social well-being, general functional status.
With which instrument can health-related quality of life be assessed?
- The "Short Form 36 Health Survey" (SF-36) assesses health-related quality of life using 36 questions.
### In Society

What is the difference between stigmatization and discrimination?
- Stigmatization describes the devaluation or attribution of prejudiced negative characteristics to a person or group based on socially negatively connoted traits or behaviors (e.g., the assumption that the student with dreadlocks smokes marijuana). However, stigmatization does not automatically imply an action. Discrimination occurs when perceived differences lead to tangible disadvantage or exclusion of the person(s) (e.g., rejecting an applicant with dreadlocks due to the assumption that he smokes marijuana).
What is meant by secondary deviance?
- Deviance generally describes behavior that deviates from existing social norms. When this deviation is caused, maintained, or further reinforced by experiences and stigmatization through society, it is called secondary deviance. Deviant behavior is often negatively sanctioned by society.
What is generally understood by psychosocial protective and risk factors?
- Psychosocial protective and risk factors affect the development and course of diseases. Risk factors alone do not cause illness but increase its likelihood. Protective factors reduce the risk of illness.
When do you describe a person as resilient?
- A person who shows good psychological and physical resilience in life crises, i.e., who remains healthy despite burdens and risks, is described as resilient. Resilience is a psychosocial protective factor.
What is meant by internal control conviction?
- The conviction that one's own behavior can influence life's events is called internal control belief.
What does the term self-efficacy expectation describe?
- Self-efficacy expectation describes the degree to which a person is convinced that their own behavior can be implemented even under adverse circumstances. It is a psychosocial protective factor.
Which psychosocial protective factor is described by the "confidence in being able to cope with problems"?
- The confidence in being able to cope with problems is called dispositional optimism.
What is meant by "dispositional optimism"?
- Dispositional optimism denotes the generalized view that things will develop positively, regardless of whether this happens through one's own actions or on their own. Such a positive attitude can protect against illness or worsening of a disease and therefore counts as a psychosocial protective factor.
What is meant by social integration?
- Social integration (syn.: structural support) refers to belonging to social groups or being integrated into a network of social relationships (on a quantitative-structural level).
What is referred to as social support and into what subcategories can it be divided?
- "Social support" is a general term for any help a person can experience from their environment in coping with specific tasks (on a qualitative-functional level). It is distinguished between informational (e.g., providing information and advice), instrumental (e.g., help with shopping), emotional (e.g., comfort, supportive conversations), and appraisal support (through sharing the same opinions and values).
What is meant by social cohesion?
- Social cohesion is understood as the extent of cohesion or mutual connectedness among members of a society.
What is referred to as social capital?
- All social relationships that contribute to trust in society are called social capital and are part of the psychosocial protective factors.
What does the disengagement theory describe?
- The disengagement theory assumes (contrary to the activity theory) that people tend to withdraw and want to be relieved of responsibility as they age. Accordingly, continued high societal and social participation and activity lead rather to life dissatisfaction.
The stress-buffer model and the main effect model are both models of the health-protective effects of social support. How do they differ?
- The stress-buffer model states that social support and integration protect against health impairments during stress, whereas the main effect model assumes that social support generally—regardless of stress—has a positive effect on health and well-being.
