# Prostate, Seminal Vesicle, and Cowper's Gland
## Summary

The accessory sex glands of the male, along with the testes and epididymis, are responsible for the production of ejaculate. They include the prostate, seminal vesicle, bulbourethral gland, and also gland packages in the ampoule of the vas deferens, which will not be discussed separately here. The weakly alkaline secretion of the accessory sex glands serves as a transport medium for sperm and contains nutrients and proteins to create the best conditions for the survival of sperm until possible fertilization of an egg. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the prostate and seminal vesicle in the respective sections on microscopic anatomy.
## Seminal Vesicle (Glandula vesiculosa)

The paired seminal vesicle (Glandula vesiculosa) is one of the accessory sex glands of men. The main function of the seminal vesicle is the production of fructose-rich seminal fluid, which ensures the energy supply for the sperm.

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Vesicular Gland

#### Profile

- Function: Production of fructose-rich, alkaline vesicular gland secretion
- Shape: Oval-flattened with bulging, "bubble-like" expansions
- Size: 5cm long, 1cm wide, 1cm thick

#### Structure

1. Curved duct: Approximately 15cm long
2. Short, elongated excretory duct (= Ductus excretorius): Merging with the distal ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct.

#### Topography of the Bladder Gland

- Location: Intrabdominal, paired located in the rectovesical connective tissue
- Location relationships
    - Ventral: Urinary bladder (fundus)
    - Dorsal: Rectum
    - Cranial: Entrance of the ureters into the bladder
    - Distal: Prostate
    - Medial: Vas deferens (Ampulla)
    - Lateral: Nerve pathways of the lateral pelvic wall

#### Vascular supply and innervation of the seminal vesicle

The bulbourethral gland is supplied with blood arteriovenously by the surrounding structures, the spermatic cord and the prostate. The predominantly sympathetic innervation is provided by the inferior hypogastric plexus.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. vesicalis inferior from A. iliaca interna<br>- A. ductus deferentis from A. umbilicalis<br>- A. rectalis media from A. iliaca interna|
|Venous|- Vesical venous plexus in the vesical veins<br>- Prostatic venous plexus in the vesical veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Sympathetic|- Prostatic plexus of the inferior hypogastric plexus<br>- Vesical plexus of the inferior hypogastric plexus|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Internal and external iliac nodes|

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Vesicular Gland

The approximately 5 cm long vesicular gland consists of the coiled glandular duct with a wide lumen, which is fused with the surrounding connective tissue. The wall of the glandular duct is composed of three layers.

1. Mucous membrane: One to two layers of prismatic glandular epithelium with mucosal folds.
2. Tunica muscularis: Strong layer of smooth muscle cells
3. Tunica adventitia: Connective tissue capsule

### Function of the Vesicular Gland

The main task of the seminal vesicle is the production of a yellowish, gelatinous, alkaline fluid (pH 7.2-7.6) that constitutes about 70% of the ejaculate volume.

- Main components of the acinar gland secretion
    - Fructose: Main energy source for sperm motility
    - Prostaglandin
    - Vitamin C
    - Proteins
- Regulation of secretion
    - Testosterone: Increases secretion production
    - Sympathetic nervous system: Increases the secretion of fluid during ejaculation

## Prostate

The prostate (prostate gland) is the clinically most important accessory sex gland of men and produces the acidic prostatic secretion. It surrounds the proximal part of the urethra, into which the two seminal ducts open.

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Prostate

#### Profile

- Function: Production of acidic prostatic secretion
- Shape: Chestnut-shaped
- Size: 3cm long, 4cm wide, 2cm thick
- Weight: 20 - 25g
- Areas and Edges
    - Apex of the prostate: Cone-shaped tip of the prostate
    - Base of the prostate: Width of the base of the prostate

#### Structure

The anatomical division is important for the clinical classification and assessment of findings and tissue samples. Clinically, McNeal's zonal classification of the prostate is preferred.

- Isthmus prostatae: Located ventrally to the urethra, free of glandular tissue.
- Median lobe: Located dorsally between the urethra and the two ejaculatory ducts.
- Right and left lobe (= right and left lobe)

##### Clinical Zone Division of the Prostate (according to McNeal)

The classification of the prostate into 5 zones is based on pathogenetic and histological criteria.

| **Zone**              | **Definition**                                                                                          | **Location**                                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Periurethral zone**  | Cuff-like glandular outlet zone                                                                      | Directly surrounds the urethra                      |
| **2. Anterior zone**       | Narrow, gland-free zone mainly consisting of connective tissue and muscles                            | Ventral to the urethra                              |
| **3. Transition zone**     | Pair transition zone                                                                                  | Laterally extending from the proximal periurethral mantle zone |
| **4. Central Zone**        | Wedge-shaped inner zone where the ejaculatory duct runs<br>- Represents 25% of the organ volume       | Cranial portion tapering to the seminal colliculus |
| **5. Peripheral Zone**     | Large, circular outer zone<br>- Represents 70% of the organ volume                                   | Adheres to the connective tissue capsule           |

> [!NOTE] Benign and malignant changes of the prostate
> The benign increase in the volume of the prostate is called benign prostatic hyperplasia. It is often noticeable due to a weakened or obstructed urinary flow, as the increase in volume mainly occurs in the urethral transition zone. Malignant prostate cancer is the most common tumor disease in men over 50 years old and primarily occurs in the peripheral zone.

#### Topography of the Prostate

- Location
    - Intra-abdominal between the bladder and the pelvic floor
    - Surrounds the proximal urethra
- Location relationships
    - Cranial: The base of the prostate is closely fused with the floor of the bladder.
    - Distal: The apex of the prostate sits on the pelvic floor.
    - Ventral: Puboprostatic ligament, which extends to the pubic bone
    - Dorsal: Rectum (Ampulla), separated from the prostate by the Denonvillier fascia (= fascia rectoprostatica)

> [!NOTE] Palpability of the prostate
> The prostate can be examined rectally through a Digital Rectal Examination (DRE). During the DRE, the consistency, size, and surface of the posterior wall are assessed.

#### Vascular supply and innervation of the prostate

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. rectalis media from A. iliaca interna<br>- A. pudenda interna from A. iliaca interna<br>- A. vesicalis inferior from A. iliaca interna|
|Venous|- Venous plexus of the bladder in the vesical veins<br>- Venous plexus of the prostate in the vesical veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Autonomous Nerve Plexus|- Prostatic plexus of the inferior hypogastric plexus|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Internal and external iliac nodes|

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Prostate

The prostate consists of a tubuloalveolar glandular parenchyma embedded in a fibromuscular stroma. The prostate is surrounded by a firm organ capsule.

- Prostate parenchyma
    - Outline
        - 30–50 individual tubuloalveolar glands
        - 15–25 prostatic ducts (Ductuli prostatici) that open into the urethra
        - Specific zone differences
            - Periurethral: Small glands with tiny end pieces
            - Central: Unfolded epithelium with narrow end pieces
            - Periphery: Smooth epithelium with wide terminal portions
    - Structure of the epithelium: Varies from simple cubic to pseudostratified columnar.
        - Basal cells: Stem cells for epithelial regeneration
        - Principal cells (luminal cells): Cells with apical secretory granules
        - Neuroendocrine cells (sparse): Production of chromogranin A and serotonin
- Stroma myelasticum of the prostate (fibromuscular stroma)
    - Fibroblasts
    - Smooth muscle cells for contraction during ejaculation
- Prostatic capsule (= Prostate capsule): Dense connective tissue with embedded smooth muscle cells

> [!NOTE]
> A simple histological distinguishing feature of the prostate are the luminal prostatic stones - these are approximately 2mm large, eosinophilic concretions with concentric layering that occur during the storage of prostatic secretions in the lumina of the glands!

### Function of the Prostate

- Formation of prostate secretions
    - Properties
        - Thin, milky secretion
        - Sour pH (6.4)
        - Makes up 30% of the ejaculate.
    - Important components
        - Acid Phosphatase
        - Prostate-specific antigen: Serine protease, serves as an organ-specific marker in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.
        - Other proteins and citric acid
    - Regulation: The androgen dihydrotestosterone induces the glandular function of the prostate.

> [!NOTE] PSA levels in the diagnosis of prostate cancer
> The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an organ-specific marker of the prostate and is used as a marker in the screening and follow-up of prostate cancer. An elevated PSA level or an increase over time may indicate prostate cancer. However, an elevated PSA level can also occur in benign prostatic hyperplasia, inflammation, and after manipulations of the prostate.

## Cowper's Gland (Bulbourethral Glands)

The secretion of the paired Cowper's gland (Gl. bulbourethralis) primarily serves as a lubricant for the ejaculate in the urethra and is secreted during sexual arousal.

- Location: Dorsal pair of the bulb of the penis in the pelvic floor muscles
- Size: Lentil-sized
- Histology: Tubuloalveolar glands with a single layer of cubic-prismatic epithelium
- Outlet: 5cm long execution channel into the proximal spongy part of the urethra
- Function: Formation of viscous, clear secretions during sexual arousal (= lubrication)
## Review Questions on the Chapter Prostate, Seminal Vesicle, and Cowper's Gland
### Bladder gland

Where is the bulbourethral gland located?
- The paired bladder gland lies intraabdominally in the rectovesical connective tissue, that is dorsal to the fundus of the urinary bladder.
What function does the seminal vesicle serve?
- The paired bladder gland (also called seminal vesicle) belongs to the accessory sex glands of the male. Its main task is the production of a fructose-rich, alkaline secretion for the energy supply of the sperm.
### Prostate

What tissue is the prostate mostly made of? Which zone of the prostate typically differs from that?
- The prostate consists mostly (almost three-quarters) of tubuloalveolar glands, whose mostly two-row epithelium is cuboidal or cylindrical depending on secretory activity. All zones contain these branched individual glands except for the zona anteromediana. This narrow gland-free zone lies ventral to the urethra and consists mainly of connective tissue and muscles.
