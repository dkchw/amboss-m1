# Sexual Development
## Summary

For the development of sexual identity, biological and psychosocial aspects are significant. The gonads and genital structures are initially formed equally in both sexes and cannot be distinguished from each other until the 6th week. Only thereafter does the differentiation into female or male gonads and genital organs begin. The development of biological sex is primarily determined by the sex chromosomes. Depending on the presence of X or Y chromosomes, the sex-specific gonads develop: testes or ovaries. In both sexes, the gonads originate in the abdominal cavity and are subsequently moved to the scrotum (♂) or the pelvis (♀). Further sexual differentiation in males occurs hormonally, while female sexual organs develop without hormonal influences.

The complete reproductive capacity is only achieved with the end of puberty, during which the adjustment of the hormonal balance and the development of secondary sexual characteristics play a crucial role.

However, it is not only biological sex that is relevant for the expression of gender identity. Equally important is psychological and social sex, which refers to an individual's identification with their own gender and its perception in society.
## Levels of Gender Determination

The determination of human sex occurs on various levels.

1. Biological sex
    1. Chromosomal sex: Genetic sex corresponding to the sex chromosomes (XX or XY)
    2. Gonadal sex: Sex of the gonads (with development of the gonads into testes or ovaries)
    3. Somatic sex: Phenotypic sex (with development of the internal and external genital organs)
2. Psychological and social gender: Gender assigned by society and individual gender identification

### Biological Sex (chromosomal, gonadal, and somatic sex)

The biological sex is determined by the sex chromosomes. Depending on the chromosomal sex, the sex of the gonads develops - the gonadal sex. Through the production of hormones, the gonads then regulate both the development of somatic sex and sexual maturation during puberty.

### Psychological and Social Gender

- Psychological gender (= sexual self-differentiation)
    - Describes the individual identification of a person with a gender independent of their biological sex (e.g., deviation between biological and psychological sex in gender incongruence)
- Social gender (engl. 'Gender')
    - The gender of a person as perceived by society
    - Based on behavioral patterns (such as thinking, acting, and emotions) that are perceived by society as "gender-specific"
    - Complex topic with its own research area: Gender Studies
## Determination of Chromosomal Sex

The chromosomal sex of an embryo is determined at the moment of fertilization when an egg cell (23, X) merges with a sperm cell (23, X or 23, Y).

- Chromosome set of humans: 44 autosomes and 2 gonosomes
- Gonosomes determine the chromosomal sex.
    - Karyotype 46, XY = male
    - Karyotype 46, XX = female

> [!NOTE] Gonosomal Chromosome Aberrations
> If meiosis or the fusion of egg and sperm is disrupted, the number of sex chromosomes may be altered. Those affected typically have a characteristic phenotype associated with changes in hormonal metabolism and fertility. Well-known examples include Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome. In Klinefelter syndrome, there is an additional X chromosome (47, XXY). The affected men have a testosterone deficiency, which leads to characteristic tall stature, delayed onset of puberty, noticeably small testicles with a deficit in sperm production, and reduced fertility. The Ullrich-Turner syndrome is based on a missing X chromosome (45, X0). This results in abnormal development of the female reproductive organs and infertility (see also "Basic Considerations of Human Genetics").

## Development of Germ Glands and Cells at a Glance (Gonadal Sex)

### Development of the Gonads

The gonadal sex is determined by the sex chromosomes. The gonads initially develop identically in both sexes in the form of the genital ridge from the mesoderm. Once the sex-specific primordial germ cells have migrated, further differentiation occurs. If a Y chromosome is present in the genome, the indifferent gonad develops into a testis; otherwise, it develops into an ovary.

- Indifferent Stadium: Until the 6th embryonic week, the gonads develop similarly in both sexes.
    - Stem cells (from approx. week 4)
        - Arise extraembryonically in the wall of the yolk sac
        - Beginning of the amoeboid migration of the primordial germ cells towards the later gonadal structure (4th-5th week)
    - Genital folds (from around the 5th week)
        - In the dorsal body wall between the mesenteric root and the primitive kidney, the coelomic epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme thicken on both sides to form longitudinal genital ridges.
    - Indifferent gonadal development (approx. 6th week)
        - As soon as the primordial germ cells reach the genital ridges, the indifferent gonadal structure develops in the medial part of the genital ridges.
        - Germinal epithelium cells differentiate into primary germ strands and surround the migrated primordial germ cells.
        - The cranial and caudal parts of the genital ridges regress into gonadal cords.
- Differentiated stage: From the 7th or 8th week, the sex-specific development of the indifferent gonads begins.
    - Control of differentiation
        - Testis Determining Factor (TDF): Transcription factor responsible for the male differentiation of the gonad.
        - Sex determining region of Y (SRY) gene: Located on the short arm of the Y chromosome and induces the formation of TDF.
    - Testes: In the presence of SRY (see also "Development of the Testes")
        - Under the control of the transcription factor TDF, the gonad develops into the testis starting from the 7th week.
    - Ovary: In the absence of SRY (see also "Development of the Ovary")
        - If no Y chromosome is present, the gonad develops into an ovary from the 8th week onward.

> [!NOTE]
> Until the 6th week, male and female gonads are identically formed and indistinguishable from one another.

> [!NOTE]
> Gonadal differentiation in gonosomal chromosomal aberrations
> The differentiation of the gonad is independent of the number of X chromosomes present. Accordingly, a testis develops even in cases of numerical chromosomal aberrations if at least one Y chromosome is present. This is also true for Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), where affected males usually develop a testis with limited functionality. The term Diplo-Male Syndrome is used when there are additional Y chromosome(s), and here too, the gonads develop into testes.

### Development of Germ Cells (Gametogenesis)

The gonads serve two main functions: on the one hand, they produce sex-specific hormones, and on the other hand, they serve as the maturation site for germ cells. These originally come from the yolk sac and migrate into the gonads during the embryonic period in both sexes. Further germ cell division and maturation occur in a sex-dependent manner and are presented comparatively in the following table.

### Development of the Sexual Organs at a Glance (Somatic Sex)

In the course of the development of the gonads of males and females, the internal and external genitalia begin to form from the 7th (♂) and 8th (♀) week, respectively. For male differentiation, the hormones Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are essential. In contrast, female differentiation occurs independently of hormones.

### Development of the Internal Sex Organs

The internal genital organs of males and females essentially develop from three embryonic genital structures: the Wolff and Müller ducts and the urogenital sinus. They are initially formed identically and then differentiate into the internal genital organs in a sex-dependent manner.

> [!NOTE]
> The urogenital sinus holds a special position, as it gives rise to both internal and external genital organs as well as urinary organs!

> [!NOTE]
> The Müller ducts differentiate into the inner female genitalia, while the Wolff ducts hormonally differentiate into the inner male genital organs. The urogenital sinus, in turn, plays an important role in urogenital development for both sexes!

### Development of the External Genital Organs

The external genital organs develop from the genital tubercle and the genital folds and swellings. These arise from mesenchymal thickening around the cloacal membrane and are identical for both sexes until the 9th week.

> [!NOTE]
> The contributions of the external genitals from which embryonic structures arise are presented inconsistently in the literature!

> [!NOTE] Intersexuality
> If the external and/or internal sexual development deviates from the norm, the sex may not always be clearly assigned as male or female after birth. If features of both sexes are present, it is referred to as intersexuality. The development of the gonads and the phenotypic sex often differ, as in the case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia – an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder with reduced cortisol synthesis in the adrenal cortex. If the negative feedback from cortisol on the pituitary gland is absent, there is an increased ACTH secretion, leading to enhanced androgen production in the adrenal cortex. The increased androgen effect results in clitoral hypertrophy in children with a female genotype, while in children with a male genotype, an enlarged penis is noted.

## Special Sexual Development in Men

The development of the male sex encompasses the sequential development of the testes, the internal and external genital organs. The embryological development is closely linked to the anatomical conditions and possible anatomical malformations.

### Development of the Testis

The paired testes of the man develop from the embryonic gonadal structure in the abdominal cavity and descend into the scrotum. In the process, the layers of the abdominal cavity protrude and form the testicular coverings.

#### Differentiation of the indifferent gonadal ridge to the testis

The man's testicles develop under the influence of TDF starting from the 7th week in the abdominal cavity.

- From the 7th week
    - Parenchyma: Primary germ strands develop into primary testicular strands that surround the germ cells.
        - Differentiation of somatic cells in the germ strands into Sertoli cells
        - The formed testicular cords further differentiate into mature seminiferous tubules.
    - Stroma: Mesenchymal cells surround and partition the gonad.
        - Formation of the tunica albuginea
        - Division of the current into septets
- From the 9th week
    - Stroma: Mesenchymal cells in the interstitium between the testicular cords develop into Leydig cells and produce testosterone → This leads to the male differentiation of the sexual organs.

#### Descent of the Testes (= Descensus testis)

The testis develops in the abdominal cavity of the male and descends into the scrotum during fetal development. The guiding structure for the movement of the testis is the gubernaculum testis. Testicular descent occurs in three phases.

1. Transabdominal Phase
    - Start: 2nd-3rd month of pregnancy after the migration of the primordial germ cells
    - Leading structure: Gubernaculum testis (differentiates from the caudal gonadal ridge) of the male
        - The cranial end of the gubernaculum is connected to the gonads.
        - The course marks the course of the later inguinal canal.
    - Processes
2. The gonad formation occurs in the abdominal cavity between the mesenteric root and the pronephros.
        2. Body growth causes the relocation of the gonad into the small pelvis along the gubernaculum.
        3. Development of the processus vaginalis testis: The peritoneum extends ventrally of the gubernaculum testis towards the scrotum.
        4. The remaining layers of the abdominal wall also protrude into the scrotum and form the boundaries of the inguinal canal.
3. Transinguinal Phase
    - Start: 7th month of pregnancy
    - Processes
        1. The testicles migrate through the inguinal canal into the scrotal sac.
        2. Tunica vaginalis testis: The evaginated peritoneum of the processus vaginalis testis forms a serous covering around each testis, creating two layers.
            - Epiorchium: Visceral layer (surrounding the testes directly)
            - Periorchium: Parietal layer (outer layer of the peritoneum)
4. Reaching the final position
    - Time: Physiologically at the time of birth
    - Processes
        1. The testes reach their final position in the scrotum.
        2. The canal of the processus vaginalis testis obliterates: The connection between the peritoneal cavities of the abdominal cavity and the scrotal cavity recedes.

> [!NOTE]
> The vessels and nerves are "taken along" during the descent of the testis and run as the spermatic cord from the upper abdomen through the inguinal canal to the testis!

> [!NOTE] Maldescent of the testicle
> An incomplete descent of the testicle into the scrotum is referred to as Maldescensus testis (undescended testicle). Since the descent can be interrupted at any stage, the testicle may be located in the abdominal cavity, inguinal region, or even outside the abdominal cavity. Maldescensus testis leads, on one hand, to reduced fertility of the affected testicle, and on the other hand, it additionally increases the risk of testicular cancer. Therefore, attempts should be made to correct the position of the testicle using medicinal or surgical methods.

> [!NOTE] Cryptorchidism
> If the testicle is not palpable, it is referred to as cryptorchidism. Thus, cryptorchidism is not a disease but merely a symptom that can occur with abdominal testicles as well as with the absence of a testis (testicular aplasia) or atrophy of the testis (testicular atrophy).

> [!NOTE] Indirect inguinal hernia
> If the obliteration of the processus vaginalis testis does not occur, the abdominal cavity and scrotal cavity remain connected. In this case, fluid can accumulate (a so-called hydrocele can form), but intestine can also protrude through the inguinal canal (indirect inguinal hernia) and cause discomfort. An emergency situation arises when the intestine and its supplying vessels are trapped in the inguinal canal (incarcerated inguinal hernia).

### Internal Male Genital Organs (from Week 7)

Through the action of specific hormonal influences, the internal male genital organs develop from the embryonic genital ducts starting from the 7th week.

|Differentiation of the internal genitalia in men|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Embryological Structure|Differentiation|Hormonal Regulation|
|Müller ducts|- Obliterate|- AMH (= Anti-Müllerian Hormone)<br>    - Function: Regression of the Müller ducts in the male sex<br>    - Production: By the Sertoli cells of the testes (=Somatic cells of the testicular cords) from the 7th week|
|Wolff ducts|- Epididymis<br>- Seminal vesicles<br>- Ductus deferens<br>- Ejaculatory duct|- Testosterone<br>    - Function: Stabilizes the Wolff ducts and promotes their further differentiation<br>    - Production: By the Leydig cells of the testis from the 9th week|
|Urogenital sinus|- Urinary organs (bladder and urethra)<br>- Prostate<br>- Bulbourethral gland|- DHT (= 5α-dihydrotestosterone)<br>    - Function: Differentiation of the urogenital sinus into the prostate and growth of the external genital organs in the sense of a male phenotype<br>    - Production: Synthesized from testosterone in target cells by 5α-reductase|
|Additionally, parts of the genitals develop from the embryological precursors of the kidney: Wolffian ducts → Efferent ducts of the epididymis; Wolffian bodies → Rete testis of the testis|   |   |

> [!NOTE]
> Only with the presence of a Y chromosome and an intact hormone balance of AMH, testosterone, and DHT can development into the male phenotype occur!

### External Male Genital Organs (from the 9th Week)

The differentiation of the penis with erectile tissues, urethra, and scrotum from the indifferent stage (see "Development of the Genitals") occurs starting in the 9th week of pregnancy.

|Emerging Structure|Predecessor|Process of Differentiation|
|---|---|---|
|Urethra|Urogenital sinus|- The floor of the urogenital sinus thickens to form the urethral plate<br>- The urethral plate deepens to form the urethral groove<br>- The urethral lumen forms through the enclosure of genital folds<br>- The formed urethra does not yet open into the glans penis, but remains externally open at the distal underside of the penile shaft|
|Penis & Glans penis|Genital tubercle|- The genital tubercle grows significantly in length due to androgen action<br>- At the distal end of the glans penis, an ectodermal epithelial tubercle forms<br>    - The epithelial tubercle invaginates and grows towards the urethral lumen → relocation of the urethral opening to the tip of the glans (=Fossa navicularis)<br>    - Formation of the prepuce (= prepuce of the penis)|
|Erectile tissue|Genital folds|- Length growth along the genital tubercle<br>    - Corpus spongiosum: Erectile tissue surrounding the urethra<br>    - Corpora cavernosa: Paired erectile tissues of the penis (dorsal to the urethra)|
|Scrotum|Genital tubercles|- Growth and fusion into the scrotal swelling<br>- Formation of the scrotum after testicular descent|
> [!NOTE] Misconceptions of the urethra
> A common malformation in the embryonic development of the penis concerns the improper opening of the urethra. In hypospadias, the external urethral orifice can be located at any position ventral on the penile shaft as well as scrotal or even perineal. In the rarer condition of epispadias, the urethra exhibits a dorsal cleft formation that can extend into the bladder and is attributed to a developmental abnormality of the cloacal membrane.

## Special Sexual Development in Women

The development of the female sex encompasses the sequential development of the ovaries, the internal and external genital organs. Based on embryological development, the anatomical relationships and the emergence of various malformations can be better understood.

### Development of the Ovary

#### Differentiation of the indifferent gonadal structure to the ovary

The ovaries of the woman develop in the abdominal cavity between the mesenteric root and the primitive kidney after the migration of the primordial germ cells.

- From the 8th week
    - Zölom epithelium cells proliferate and develop into germ strands, which form the medulla and cortex of the ovaries.
        - Primary germ strands
            1. Displacement into the depth of the gonad
            2. Training of the market strands
            3. Decline and transformation of the connective tissue strands into the stroma of the ovarian medulla
        - Secondary germ strands
            1. Penetration into the superficial layers of the gonad and formation of the cortical strands
            2. Differentiation of the epithelial cell layer of the ovarian cortex
            3. Surround the germ cells, which lie just below the surface of the gonad.
    - A thin mesenchymal sheath forms (precursor of the tunica albuginea)
- From the 12th week
    - The epithelial cell layer of the ovarian cortex differentiates into follicular epithelial cells.
    - Development of primordial follicles (see "Follicle maturation")

> [!NOTE]
> The primary germ strands regress in women!

#### Descent of the Ovaries

The ovary is also relocated caudally from the 2nd to the 3rd month of pregnancy, similarly to the testis, but only down to the small pelvis. During the descent of the ovary, the suspensory ligaments of the uterus also develop.

- Definition: Displacement of the ovary into the small pelvis
    - Start: 2nd-3rd month of pregnancy
    - Guiding structure: Gubernaculum ovarii (differentiates from the caudal gonadal band)
    - Process: Migration of the ovaries with increasing body growth along the lower gonadal ligament into the pelvic cavity.
- Development of the supporting ligaments of the uterus and ovaries
    - Following the descent of the ovary, the lower gonadal ligament develops into the proper ovarian ligament (cranial) and the round ligament of the uterus (caudal).
    - The upper gonadal ligament becomes the suspensory ligament of the ovary.

### Further Development of the Female Genital Organs

The development of the female genital organs occurs independently of hormones when there is no Y chromosome present. The external genitalia of the woman (vulva) begins to form around the urogenital slit of the urogenital sinus from the 9th week onward, which remains open unlike in the male sex.

|Embryological Structure|   |Differentiation into Female Genital Organs|
|---|---|---|
|Müller Ducts|Upper Portions|- The fallopian tubes arise from the two upper portions of the Müller ducts|
|Lower Portions|- Uterovaginal canal: The distal portions of the Müllerian ducts fuse<br>    - Uterus<br>    - Vagina (upper 3/4)|
|Wolff's Ducts|   |- Wolff's Ducts and the primordial kidney tubules regress|
|Urogenital sinus|Upper part|- Urinary organs<br>    - Urinary bladder<br>    - Urethra|
|Average share|- Genital organs<br>    - Vagina (lower 1/4)<br>        - Formation of the vaginal plate: thickening between parts of the distal uterovaginal canal and adjacent parts of the urogenital sinus<br>        - Canalization of the vaginal plate to the vaginal canal<br>        - Hymen (= virgin membrane) remains as a boundary to the distal part of the urogenital sinus<br>    - Vestibulum vaginae: The urogenital cleft remains open and forms the vaginal entrance|
|Lower portion|- Sexual glands<br>    - Bartholin's glands<br>    - Minor vestibular glands|
|Genital tubercle|   |- Clitoris: Slight increase in size of the genital tubercle and formation of the clitoral crura|
|Genital folds|   |- Labia minora: The genital folds surround the vestibule of the vagina and differentiate into the inner labia<br>- Formation of the bulb of the vestibule|
|Genital tubercles|   |- Labia majora: Increase in size and differentiation of the genital tubercles|

> [!NOTE]
> The development of the internal female genital organs is not hormonally regulated - in contrast to male sex differentiation!

> [!NOTE] Uterine malformations
> When the fusion of the Müllerian ducts is disturbed, the uterus and vagina can also be formed doubly. The spectrum ranges from the arcuate uterus (indentation of the fundus) to the bicornuate uterus (two separate uterine horns that lead into one cervix and vagina) to the complete duplex uterus (two separate uterine horns with two vaginal canals).

## Sexual Maturation in Man and Woman (Puberty)

The phase of adolescence in which sexual maturation occurs is referred to as puberty. It is accompanied by a hormonal adjustment that leads to morphological changes in the primary and secondary sexual organs.

### Beginning and Duration of Puberty

- Definition: Life stage in which human reproductive capability develops and secondary sexual characteristics are formed.
- Start
    - Different entry for girls and boys
    - Large variability within the same gender
    - Girls: Onset of puberty around 11 years old
        - Menarche (the time of the first menstrual period) occurs about two years after the onset of breast development.
        - Growth spurt around the age of 12
    - Boys: Start at around 13 years old
        - Early signs: Testicular volume↑ (>3ml=Onset of puberty)
        - Growth spurt around the age of 14
        - Voice change around the age of 15
- Influencing factors on the onset of puberty
    - Depends significantly on the hormonal balance (especially gonadotropin, but also leptin)
    - Possibly dependent on dietary factors and body weight
- Duration: Typically 4 years for both genders

### Hormonal Changes during Puberty

The first hormonal change of puberty occurs in the adrenal gland. Following the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the maturation of the sex glands begins after adrenarche.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Adrenarche|- Definition: Increase in androgen synthesis in the reticular zone of the adrenal gland<br>- Timing: 7th to 9th year of life<br>- Trigger: Still unknown<br>- Involved hormones: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEAS, Androstenedione<br>- Consequences: Growth of sexual organs, Pubarche (growth of pubic hair)|
|Gonadarche|- Definition: Onset of gonadal maturation through the establishment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis<br>- Timing: Following adrenarche, approximately 1-1½ years before menarche/spermarche<br>- Trigger: Start of pulsatile GnRH secretion in the hypothalamus → Increase in gonadotropin synthesis in the anterior pituitary → Gonadal maturation↑<br>- Involved hormones: GnRH, LH, FSH, androgens, estrogens, progestogens<br>- Consequences<br>    - ♂: Increased androgen synthesis, spermarche<br>    - ♀: Increased estrogen and progestogen synthesis|
|Other hormonal changes: Growth hormones (GH)↑, Insulin↑, IGF-1↑|   |

> [!NOTE]
> The well-known mood swings during puberty are attributed to the increased effects of testosterone and GH!

### Morphological Changes During Puberty

There are phenotypic and organic characteristics that are specifically assigned to the female or male sex and undergo particular changes during puberty. In this context, primary and secondary sexual characteristics are distinguished.

|Development|Gender|Definition|Start|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pubarche|♀♂|Development of pubic hair|Between 8th and 14th year of life|
|Thelarche|♀|Development of the female breast|Between the ages of 8 and 13|
|Menarche|♀|Time of the first menstrual bleeding|Between the ages of 11-13|
|Spermarche|♂|Beginning of sperm production in the testicles|Between the ages of 13 and 15|

#### Primary and secondary sexual characteristics

|Sexual Characteristics|Meaning|Female|Male|
|---|---|---|---|
|Primary sexual characteristics|- Internal and external reproductive organs needed for reproduction|- Vulva<br>- Vagina<br>- Fallopian tube<br>- Uterus<br>- Ovaries|- Penis<br>- Scrotum with testes and epididymis<br>- Prostate<br>- Vas deferens|
|Secondary Sexual Characteristics|- Physical traits that allow for external gender assignment but are not directly involved in reproduction<br>- Develop during puberty and signal sexual maturity|- Pubic and underarm hair<br>- Breast growth<br>- Change in body shape: wide pelvis, narrow waist and shoulders|- Hair growth<br>    - Chest, arms, legs, abdomen, back<br>    - Pubic and underarm hair<br>    - Beard growth<br>- Voice change, prominence of the larynx ("Adam's apple")<br>- Change in body shape: broad shoulders and narrow hips|

> [!NOTE] Precocious puberty
> If puberty begins before the age of 7-8 years, it is referred to as precocious puberty. The secondary sexual characteristics develop very early and are accompanied by an early closure of the epiphyseal plates of the bones. The causes are differentiated between central precocious puberty with elevated gonadotropin levels (for example, in pituitary tumors) and pseudo-precocious puberty, which is based on increased peripheral hormone production.

### Differences of Sex Development (DSD)

Heterogeneous group with deviations from typical sexual development. For example, the formation of the gonads and the external sex differ.

- 46,XX-DSD
    - Karyotype: Female (46,XX)
    - Phenotype: Male
    - Cause: Among other things, excessive androgen activity
        - Most often caused by an adrenal genital syndrome
- 46,XY-DSD
    - Karyotype: Male (46, XY)
    - Phenotype: Female
    - Cause: Among others, diminished androgen effect
        - For example, disturbances in androgen biosynthesis, androgen receptor defects, lack of AMH effect
- Ovotesticular DSD
    - Karyotype: Variable
    - Phenotype: Female and male gonads and sexual characteristics present
    - Cause: Unknown
## Review Questions on the Chapter of Sexual Development
### Development of the Gonads and Germ Cells at a Glance (gonadal sex)

From the undifferentiated germ cell, either testes or ovaries develop, depending on the sex chromosomes. Which gene plays an important role in this process?
- On the short arm of the Y chromosome lies the so-called Sex-determining-region-of-Y (SRY) gene. If this gene (and thus a Y chromosome) is present in the genome, the testes develop. If the gene is missing, the ovaries develop.
### Development of the Sexual Organs at a Glance (Somatic Sex)

From which embryonic structure do the efferent ductules of the testis develop?
- The ductuli efferentes testis develop from the nephric tubules of the mesonephros.
For which organ is the genital tubercle the embryonic precursor?
- The genital tubercle (tuberculum genitale) differentiates into the clitoris or penis with urethra and corpora cavernosa.
### Special Sexual Development in Men

Where does the descent of the testis begin? Which guiding structure does it follow?
- The descent of the testis begins in the abdominal cavity; from there it migrates along the gubernaculum testis into the scrotum.
Which cells produce the hormone for the obliteration of the Müllerian ducts?
- The Sertoli cells (= somatic cells of the testis cords) produce anti-Müllerian hormone from the 7th week of pregnancy, which leads to regression and obliteration of the Müllerian ducts.
For which structures is the Wolffian duct an embryological precursor?
- From the Wolffian duct develop testosterone-mediated epididymis, seminal vesicles, ductus deferens, and ejaculatory duct.
To what structure does the urogenital sinus differentiate?
- The urogenital sinus develops under the influence of DHT (5α-dihydrotestosterone) into the prostate, bulbourethral gland, as well as the urinary bladder and urethra.
### Special Sexual Development of Women

Which structures develop from the lower gonadal ridge?
- The urogenital sinus develops under the influence of DHT (5α-dihydrotestosterone) into the prostate, bulbourethral gland, as well as the urinary bladder and urethra.
Which female genital organs develop from the Müllerian ducts?
- The Müllerian ducts are divided into an upper and lower part. From the upper part develop the fallopian tubes, the lower parts unite into uterus and vagina.
