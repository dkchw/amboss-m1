# Relationship between doctors and patients
## Summary

The relationship between doctors and patients is essential for the course of treatment – a positive relationship is fundamentally based on effective communication. To achieve this, it is important to be aware of the basic principles as well as potential difficulties and sources of error in communication. First, the levels, forms, and structures of communication will be explained in general. Subsequently, the relationship will be explained in detail.

In addition to successful communication, it is also important for both sides to be aware of the expectations associated with their roles. However, it can sometimes be a challenge to meet these expectations and reconcile them with external circumstances. For example, it is sometimes difficult for doctors to balance the expectation of providing optimal care for patients with the necessary economic considerations. Such expectations that are difficult or impossible to reconcile, along with the general fact that every person has various roles to fulfill, can lead to role conflicts.

Regarding the patient role, it is particularly important to consider how patients deal with their illness, as this significantly influences the course of the disease. For example, the illness can bring a primary or secondary gain for individual patients. The cause that patients sometimes attribute to their illness also affects how they behave within the treatment process. Last but not least, patients may find it difficult to cooperate with doctors if they feel overwhelmed or misunderstood.

Finally, this chapter will address the special characteristics of the medical profession as well as the societal and legal requirements placed upon it.
## Communication and Interaction

To understand as many aspects of communication between doctors and patients as possible, it is useful to engage with the levels, forms, and structures of communication. These will first be explained generally, and then the relationship will be examined in detail.

### The four levels of communication

The communication scientist Schulz von Thun defined four levels of communication. Each statement can be interpreted and understood differently, depending on which level it is received on. The following will illustrate these levels using the exemplary statement of a patient, "Oh, Doctor, I'm feeling worse again today."

| Four Levels of Communication according to Schulz von Thun |                                                                                                   |                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Level                                             | Explanation                                                                                       | Example                                                     |
| Content Level (Factual Message)                    | At the content level, the factual information of the message is conveyed.                          | "I'm feeling worse today than yesterday."                   |
| Relationship Level (Relationship Message)           | The relationship level conveys how the two conversational partners relate to each other. | "I believe that you can help me."                       |
| Self-revelation (Self-disclosure)                  | At the level of self-revelation, the patient reveals something about herself.                     | "It worries me that I'm feeling worse today." |
| Appeal                                             | At the level of the appeal, an expectation or demand is conveyed.                          | "I want you to help me feel better."    |

### Forms of Communication

There are various forms of communication, of which the most important will be described below.

#### Verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal communication

When we communicate, we do so in various ways, thus conveying information on different levels.

- Verbal Communication
    - Medium: Language
    - Function: Communication of the content aspect of the message
- Non-verbal communication: Partly unconscious and without voluntary control
    - Medium: Gesture, facial expression, body posture, physical contact, eye contact
    - Function: Communication of the relationship aspect between sender and recipient
- Paraverbal Communication
    - Medium: Speech tempo, pitch, volume
    - Function: Communication of the relationship aspect between sender and recipient

#### Personal and Media Communication

- Personal communication: The interaction partners are facing each other directly.
- Medial Communication: The interaction partners communicate through a medium (e.g. by phone or email)

#### Metacommunication and Paradoxical Communication

- Metacommunication: Communication about a communication that has occurred or is currently taking place (how does one feel in relation to the conversation partner?)
- Paradox communication: Contradictory statements are sent to the receiving person on both the content and relationship levels.
- Double bind
    - Special case of paradoxical communication
    - The situation seems hopeless.
    - Due to a dependency on the conversation partner, the contradictions in the statements cannot be addressed.

### Structures of Communication

The following describes the different types of arrangements or structures that communication can take. Depending on the hierarchical level at which the communication partners are situated, a distinction is made between symmetrical and asymmetrical communication. The four forms of interactional contingency describe the manner in which the interaction partners behave towards one another and provide clues about the symmetry of the communication. Depending on which of the two interaction partners determines the course of the conversation, a further distinction is made between directive and non-directive communication.

#### Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical Communication

Symmetrical and asymmetrical communication describes the hierarchy levels of conversation partners.

- Symmetrical communication: Both conversation partners are on the same level (e.g., a conversation among colleagues)
- Asymmetrical communication: The conversation partners are on different levels (e.g., a conversation between a doctor and a patient)
    - Features of asymmetrical communication
        1. Passing over questions: The medical side acts as if it hasn't heard the patient-side questions.
        2. Change of addressee: The medical side addresses someone else instead of responding to the patient's statements.
        3. Change of topic: The medical side changes the subject instead of addressing the patient-side remarks.
        4. Relationship comment: Instead of addressing the patient's statements objectively, the medical side expresses a relationship comment.
        5. Communication of Functional Uncertainty: The medical side avoids the patient's question by stating that it does not yet have enough information to provide an answer.
    - Causes of asymmetrical communication
        1. Different social status
        2. Different levels of knowledge regarding the topic of conversation
        3. Different power relations, e.g. regarding the power of definition and the power of control

##### Four Forms of Interaction Contingency

The term "contingency" is used in various ways. In psychology, it describes the frequency or likelihood with which, for example, two behaviors occur together. The term interactional contingency describes the extent to which communication partners adhere to their behavior plans and whether they respond to each other. The four forms of interactional contingency provide clues about the symmetry in communication.

- Mutual contingency: The interaction partners respond to each other and take into account both their own needs and those of the other person.
- Asymmetric contingency: One of the two interacting individuals adheres to their views/behavior plans and does not respond to the needs of the other party.
- Pseudocontingency: Both interaction partners maintain their views/behavior plans without addressing each other.
- Reactive contingency: The interaction partners engage with each other to such an extent that they temporarily subordinate their own views/behavior plans.

#### Directive and non-directive communication

- Non-directive conversation management: The course of the conversation is determined by the patient; the medical side does not steer the course in a specific direction.
    - Scope of application: Useful at the beginning and end of the medical history, to gain an impression of the thoughts, concerns, and wishes of the patients.
    - Question style: In particular, open questions
    - Focus: On patients
- Directive conversation management: The medical side influences the course of the conversation and directs it in a direction it desires.
    - Scope of application: Useful for the subsequent course of the medical history, to specifically obtain the necessary information
    - Question style: In particular, closed questions
    - Focus: On doctors

### Basic Features of Helpful Conversation Management

The way of conducting conversations significantly contributes to interpersonal relationships. The first three of the following basic characteristics of helpful conversation techniques are derived from the principles of client-centered, non-directive talk therapy by Carl Rogers. Transparency helps patients understand medical actions and enhances their willingness to cooperate.

- Empathy: The medical side tries to put itself in the other person's shoes and reflect their feelings.
- Appreciation: The medical side conveys appreciation and acceptance.
- Authenticity/Congruence: The medical side stands behind its statements.
- Transparency: Furthermore, the medical side should explain the context in which they are asking their questions and why they prefer the diagnostics and therapy they have proposed.

### Sociocultural Difficulties

One of the main sociocultural difficulties includes the different communication styles, which can sometimes lead to doctors and patients not fully understanding each other during conversations.

- Language styles: The medical language styles are evaluated on two levels.
    - Technical language vs. everyday language
        - Technical language is difficult for laypeople to understand and should therefore be avoided in patient discussions.
    - Restricted vs. elaborated language code
        - Social class influences word choice and expression (Bernstein hypothesis)
            - People from lower educational backgrounds tend to have a simple language code ("restricted language code")
            - People from higher educational backgrounds are more likely to possess a complex language code ("elaborated language code")
        - The medical side should adapt to the language code of their counterpart.

| Features of different language codes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Restricted Language Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Elaborated Language Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| - Present tense dominates<br>- No sharp distinction between personal and impersonal pronouns<br>- Short, often verb-less, rigid sentences<br>- Frequent use of proverbs and stereotypes<br>- Intentions are rarely verbalized<br>- Limited abstraction capacity | - More frequent use of subjunctive and adverbs<br>- Frequent use of personal and impersonal pronouns, conjunctions, and prepositions<br>- Grammatically complex sentences<br>- Highly differentiated vocabulary<br>- Distinction between reasoning and conclusion<br>- Extensive abstraction capacity |

### Problematic Interaction Patterns

There are various problematic interaction patterns that can negatively affect the relationship between doctors and patients as well as the course of treatment.

- Iatrogenic fixation: Through the way the examining person behaves, the examined person feels confirmed in their suspicion of actually being physically ill. This can go so far that patients actually develop symptoms.
- Reactance: Resistance to the will or ideas of others, triggered by the feeling of being restricted in one’s freedom of action.
- Collusion: Problematic interaction pattern in which two individuals unconsciously act according to a common principle that does not lead to a solution.
- Projection: Traits that are not accepted in oneself are falsely attributed to other people.

> [!NOTE] Avoidance of an iatrogenic fixation
> To counteract an iatrogenic fixation in the context of a psychosomatic illness, the treating individual should signal to the affected person that their complaints are taken seriously. Furthermore, they should convey possible connections between distressing feelings and physical complaints and demonstrate that the complaints will not have serious consequences. Additionally, the affected person should be regularly invited for discussions, regardless of their complaints – this can ensure that the complaints are decoupled from medical visits and the person experiences medical care and attention even when no complaints are present.

#### Transference and Countertransference

To practice medicine, it is helpful to be aware of the phenomena of transference and countertransference. This way, one can better understand sometimes inappropriate reactions from the patient and does not need to take them personally. It can also prevent one from carrying out transfers onto patients oneself. (See also: Psychotherapeutic Methods)
## Models of the Relationship Between Doctors and Patients

### Paternalistic Model (Traditional Model)

- Nowadays, no longer appropriate in most situations.
- Patient is not actively involved in the decision.
- Doctor decides on the further course of action

### Consumer Model (informative model)

- Assumption: The patient has already concrete ideas and wishes.
- Doctor provides only the missing information.
- Patient: decides on the further course of action.

### Partnership Model (currently favored model)

- Both sides make a decision together in the spirit of participatory decision-making (Shared Decision-Making) and develop an action plan.
    - They work together to understand the patient's ideas and wishes.
    - Empowerment: The patient is empowered to participate in decision-making and receives the necessary information from the medical side to do so.
    - Doctor shares their own recommendation with the patient.
    - Patient:in decides on the further course of action based on this.
    - Self-management: Patient gains the necessary competence and is thus able to independently cope with their illness.

> [!NOTE]
> Study results indicate that the need for information is very high among most patients. However, they should always be asked in advance how much they want to be involved in the decision-making process and how great their need for information is, as there are significant differences among patients in this regard!

> [!NOTE] Patient Education  
> A patient education occurs at almost every contact and is essential for a good relationship. Physicians are subject to a duty of disclosure: In the course of treatment, they inform patients about the diagnosis, necessary diagnostics, prognostic course, and therapy. If the patient's consent is required during the disclosure – for example, for a medical procedure – this must be documented in writing. The following points should be considered in the context of patient education:
> 
> - Allow enough time
> - Consider patient-related prior knowledge and need for information.
> - Encourage questions and the sharing of feelings
> - Convey hope
> - Summarize information conveyed by the patient.

## The Medical Role

### Norms of the Medical Role

The medical role is associated with certain expectations, just like any other role. The American sociologist Talcott Parsons summarized the following expectations of the medical profession in 1951:

- Functional Specificity
    - Intervenes only to the extent that the profession prescribes
    - Does not exceed their own professional competencies, thus does not act in other medical or non-medical fields.
    - Does not exploit role
- Affective Neutrality
    - Puts their own emotions aside in relation to patients.
    - Necessary for the appropriate handling of patients who evoke internal aversion or excessive sympathy.
- Universalism: Treats all people equally and, for example, makes no distinctions based on age, gender, ethnic origin, or religion.
- Collectivity orientation: Acts primarily in the interest of the community and only then considers personal benefit.
- Competence: Applies professional competence according to the tasks (diagnosis and therapy).

### Burdens of the Medical Profession

The specific characteristics of the medical profession lead to a range of psychological and physical stresses. On the other hand, doctors may be exposed to role conflicts that can also exist in any other social situation outside of this profession.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Psychological burdens|- Great responsibility for the lives and health of others<br>- Moral conflicts in decision-making<br>- Dealing with stressful events<br>- Restrictions imposed by the healthcare system and health insurance|
|Physical Strains|- Long working hours<br>- Shift work<br>- Physically demanding work|

#### Role Conflicts

Every social role is associated with specific expectations. The attempt to meet these expectations is partly linked to conflicts.

- Intra-role conflict
    - Definition
        - Conflict within a role
        - Different expectations are placed on the medical role, which can sometimes be difficult to reconcile with each other.
        - Roll sector: Expectations based on a reference group
    - Example: The patient from her doctor the best possible treatment. However, due to the regulations of the healthcare system, the doctor is compelled to save costs as much as possible.
- Role conflict
    - Definition: Conflict between two different roles that an individual simultaneously holds
    - Example: A doctor has other roles (e.g. mother) alongside her role as a doctor, which can sometimes be difficult to reconcile.
- Role deviation
    - Definition: The actions of a person do not align with role expectations.
    - Example: A doctor who speaks very colloquially.
- Rolling distance
    - Definition: The role-bearing person questions their role with the aim of reconciling the corresponding role expectations with their own needs.
    - Example: A doctor has the need to optimally care for her patient, but she must also keep an eye on costs. This can lead her to question her role.
- Social sanction
    - Definition: Positive or negative reaction to a role expectation
    - Example: A patient chooses another hospital because he was dissatisfied with his treatment.

##### Acceptance of a Role

- Role identification
    - The role-bearing person identifies with their role
    - The expectations tied to the role correspond to the personal needs of the person embodying the role.
- Role conformity
    - The person carrying the role meets the expectations of their role.

> [!NOTE] Burnout Syndrome
> The burnout syndrome is characterized by a persistent state of exhaustion that extends across all areas of life (work, family, leisure). It occurs when individuals are exposed to high levels of stress over a long period of time. Those affected feel overwhelmed, develop a negative attitude, are often irritable, or experience feelings of guilt. They also often lose their empathy towards others. In terms of symptoms, the burnout syndrome can present similarly to a depression, but it is still its own distinct and unrecognized condition according to ICD-10.

> [!NOTE] Helper syndrome
> Many people in social professions have a strong desire to help others. By helping others, they experience a sense of strength, but often overlook their own need for help.

### Ways to Maintain Health in the Medical Profession

The following consulting services enable doctors to better cope with difficulties and problems at work:

- Supervision
    - Definition: Individual counseling or group counseling by trained supervisors to improve the effectiveness of the work.
    - Goal: Improvement of diagnostics and therapy
- Balint Group
    - Definition: In a trained Balint group, a group of doctors discusses problematic cases and seeks appropriate solutions.
    - Goal: Improvement of the relationship or interaction between doctors and patients
## The Sick Roll

### Features of the sick role

The American sociologist Talcott Parsons defined, alongside the norms of the medical role, the following characteristics of the sick role:

- Exemption from role obligations: Sick individuals are exempt from social role expectations (e.g., from their work and household duties)
- Efforts to restore health: Society expects that the sick recover as quickly as possible and resume their role in society.
- Commitment to cooperation with physicians: The society expects that patients cooperate with their physicians and adhere to their instructions.

### Dealing with Patients and Their Illness

#### Secondary Gain

The illness can, in some respects, also represent a gain for the affected person. A distinction is made here between primary illness gain and secondary illness gain.

#### Subjective Theories of Illness

Patients often have their own thoughts about where their complaints or illnesses come from or why they have become ill. This is referred to as subjective illness theory. However, the data collected retrospectively on this is not reliable, as no causal relationships can be established from it. It is important for doctors to inquire about and discuss the subjective illness theories with patients, as they can significantly influence coping with illness and the course of the disease. The following levels should be considered in the course:

- Willingness to cooperate: The sick person will only follow the doctor's recommendations if they consider them meaningful in terms of their own theory of illness.
- Emotional state: If the sick person believes they bear some responsibility for their illness and perceives it, for example, as a punishment, this significantly influences their emotional state and thus also the further healing process.
- Professional reintegration: Whether a person returns to work after recovery largely depends on how they themselves have assessed their prognosis regarding this.
- Coping with illness
    - Action-oriented
    - Cognition-related
    - Emotion-related

#### Causal Attribution

The term “causal attribution” translates to cause assignment. For example, people often attribute causes to negative, but also positive events. The causes can be divided into three different “causal dimensions.”

|Overview of the three different causal dimensions|   |
|---|---|
|1. Place of Cause|   |
|Internal|A person sees the cause in themselves.|
|External|A person attributes their complaints to external triggers.|
|2. Stability of the Cause|   |
|Variable|A person sees the cause of their complaints as changeable.|
|Stabil|A person perceives the cause of their complaints as unchangeable.|
|3. Extent of Causal Attribution|   |
|Specific|The cause applies only to a specific area (e.g., only at work, but not in the private environment).|
|Global|A person sees the cause of their complaints as a general trigger for their problems.|

> [!NOTE]
> People tend to attribute their own misbehavior to external circumstances, while they are more likely to attribute the misbehavior of others to their personality. This is referred to as the fundamental attribution error!

> [!NOTE] Influence of causal attributions on the course of the disease
> The perception of causes also affects what solutions an affected person sees for their illness. Thus, the type of causal attribution influences the respective subjective illness theory. If a person sees the cause of their illnesses primarily in themselves, they feel that they can also influence the further course of the disease. For example, a patient who has smoked heavily for many years and suffered a heart attack may realize that their nicotine consumption is partly responsible and that they can positively influence the further course by quitting smoking. However, seeing the cause of negative events in oneself can also have negative effects. If a female patient, for example, develops a brain tumor and does "not bear any responsibility" for it, it would not be beneficial for her emotional experience if she still sees the cause of this illness in herself and interprets the cancer as a punishment for a transgression.

> [!NOTE] Depression
> Depressive patients typically tend to have an internal-global-stable causal attribution. They see the cause of every conceivable failure (“global”) within themselves (“internal”) and consider it an unchangeable fact (“stable”). This leads to the following assumption, for example: “I am simply a failure in every area. That will not change.”

#### Control Conviction

While causal attribution describes where patients see the cause of their illness, locus of control reflects patients' view of who or what can influence their complaints. Three dimensions are distinguished here.

- Internal control belief: Patient believes they can influence their symptoms and the course of the illness.
- Social-external locus of control: Patient believes that other people (e.g., doctors) could influence the symptoms and course of the illness.
- External-fatalistic locus of control: Patient believes that abstract factors such as fate or chance determine the symptoms and the course of the disease.

#### Patient's Handling of Pain

In the context of illnesses, pain often occurs. Proper management of it is important, as otherwise, there is a risk that the pain may become chronic. A number of chronicity factors are distinguished, of which a selection of the psychosocial factors will be presented in more detail below. Other important factors include, for example, iatrogenic factors and sociodemographic factors.

- Chronification factors of pain
    - Permanent professional or social stress
    - Psychiatric comorbidities
    - Cognitive factors
        - Suppressive cognitions: The pain is not permitted and is suppressed.
        - Catastrophizing: The pain is interpreted as something threatening and dangerous.
    - Behavioral factors
        - Endurance behavior: Despite pain no limitation in professional and private everyday life, e.g. a patient participates in a sports course despite severe back pain
        - Avoidance behavior: Physical and/or social activities are avoided due to pain, e.g., a patient takes it easy because he fears that physical activity could exacerbate his back pain (fear-avoidance strategy)
    - Secondary gain
        - Primary Gain: The pain helps those affected avoid having to confront existing psychological issues.
        - Secondary gain from illness: Those affected receive benefits due to the pain

### Communication and Cooperation

#### Participation of Patients

In the context of diagnostics and therapy, it is important for patients to cooperate with their doctors – however, they should not do so unconditionally. It can sometimes be helpful for patients to question the medical actions sensibly.

- Therapy adherence: Adhering to mutually agreed-upon therapy recommendations within the context of a strong relationship between doctors and patients.
- Compliance: Unilateral adherence to medical advice/instructions by the patients.
- Non-Compliance: Lack of unilateral adherence to medical advice/instructions by the patients
- Intelligent Non-Compliance: Exists when patients question or do not follow medical advice for good reasons.

> [!NOTE]
> While the frequently used term "compliance," which is considered somewhat outdated, describes the unilateral adherence to therapy recommendations by patients, the term "adherence" corresponds to the more current concept of a mutual relationship between doctors and patients!

##### Influencing factors on compliance or therapy adherence

- Type of disease (Diseases with low symptom burden, for example, tend to have a negative impact)
- Type of treatment (for example, a complex treatment plan tends to have a negative impact, whereas training tends to have a positive impact)
- Type of relationship between doctor and patient: incomprehensible explanations or time pressure have a rather negative impact, for example.
- Characteristics of patients (a strong fear of side effects tends to have a more negative impact, for example)

#### Simulation, Dissimulation and Aggravation

These three terms describe how or to what extent complaints are expressed.

- Simulation: Complaints are being feigned.
- Dissimulation: Complaints are denied or downplayed.
- Aggravation: Complaints are portrayed as worse than they actually are.
## Special Features of the Medical Profession

Besides the various role models and interactions between doctors and patients, there are also societal and legal requirements for the medical profession. These are imposed not only by legislators but also by bodies such as the medical association. The organizational form of medical work can also present specific challenges. The following will explain the sociological characteristics of a profession (= occupation, trade) as well as the specific features of the professionalization of the medical profession.

### Sociological Characteristics of a Profession

- Expert knowledge: Acquired through scientific insights and experiences and their transmission to subsequent generations.
- Professional autonomy: Self-determined establishment of scientifically acceptable practices
- Collegial self-monitoring: Independent control of work, e.g. through medical professional courts
- Monopolistic service offering: Provision of services by only one entity

### Characteristics of the Professionalization of the Medical Profession

- Education and Professional Licensing
    - Unified academic professional training and acquisition of job-specific competencies
    - State-regulated professional licensing through the Federal Medical Council Act (BÄO) or the Medical Licensing Regulations (ÄApprO)
    - Protected professional title as "Doctor"
- Merger into professional political organizations
    - Medical Associations: It is the duty of all doctors to be a member of the regional medical association that is responsible for them.
    - Association of Statutory Health Physicians: It is the duty of all practicing physicians to be a member of the Association of Statutory Health Physicians and to obtain a contract physician position, provided that legally insured patients are treated within the practice.
    - For more information on the roles of the statutory health insurance physicians' association and the medical chamber in comparison, see: Health system in Germany
- Professional Regulations: Resolution by State Medical Associations, based on the (Model) Professional Regulations of the Federal Medical Association
- Medical Professional Ethics
    - Based on the Hippocratic Oath
    - General principles of action that all doctors must follow
    - Failure to comply may result in sanctions, including the revocation of the license to practice.
- Specialization
    - As part of the specialization, there is the opportunity for doctors to specialize in specific fields or areas of focus after general training in their studies.
    - This results in the attainment of specialist designations or focus designations.

#### Deprofessionalization Trends

In recent years, there have been increasing trends of deprofessionalization in the medical profession. The characteristics of professionalization are becoming less pronounced as a result.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Relationship Between Doctors and Patients
### Communication and Interaction

What is meant by the four levels of communication?
- Every statement can be received and interpreted on four different levels (factual level, relationship level, self-revelation, appeal). When sender and receiver interpret the statement on different levels, misunderstandings can occur.

What is the difference between non-verbal communication and paraverbal communication?
- Paraverbal communication occurs through variations in speech melody, pitch, and volume (i.e., through individual variations of speaking); non-verbal communication, on the other hand, takes place through body language (gestures, facial expressions, posture, eye contact).

What does metacommunication mean?
- Metacommunication is the "talking about talking" – communication about the course of an ongoing conversation, in which the conversation partners, for example, discuss how they are currently feeling during the conversation with the other person.

What causes asymmetric communication?
- Asymmetric communication arises when the conversation partners are on different hierarchy levels, i.e., when they differ in terms of social status, knowledge regarding the conversation topic, and power relations concerning definitional power and steering power (as is usually the case in the relationship between doctors and patients).

What type of conversation technique should doctors use at the beginning of the medical history?
- At the beginning of the anamnesis/consultation, they should apply the non-directive conversation technique, where patients determine the course of the conversation through an open question from the doctor and can freely report on their complaints, concerns, and wishes.

Why are the basic features of client-centered therapy according to Rogers so important?
- By living and conveying the basic features of client-centered therapy according to Rogers (empathy, appreciation, and genuineness/congruence) in communication, doctors create the foundation for a trusting relationship, which in turn is the prerequisite for successful therapy.

What does iatrogenic fixation mean and how can it be avoided?
- Iatrogenic fixation means that patients, in the context of a psychosomatic illness, mistakenly fixate on suffering from a particular physical disease and are reinforced in their assumption by inappropriate (diagnostic or therapeutic) measures from the physician's side. This can be avoided by doctors taking patients' concerns and complaints seriously but clearly explaining the circumstances of the illness and assuring that the complaints will not have serious physical consequences.

### Models of the Relationship between Doctors and Patients

What is the basis of the nowadays no longer appropriate paternalistic model?
- The traditional paternalistic model is based on doctors not involving their patients in the development of an action plan and making all decisions alone.

What two other models are there?
- Besides the paternalistic model, there is the consumer model, where doctors provide their patients with missing information, but the patients make all decisions alone regarding further procedure, as well as the nowadays favored partnership model, in which decisions are made jointly.

What does Shared Decision Making mean?
- Shared Decision Making means that both parties, within the partnership model, together develop an action plan that meets the patient's ideas and wishes. Decisions are made jointly in the sense of participative decision-making.

How does empowerment work?
- Empowerment ("authorization") works by doctors providing their patients with all necessary information required for decision-making (e.g., regarding further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures). Patients are thereby "empowered" to actively and informedly participate in decisions.

### The medical role

Functional specificity is one of the five behavioral expectations of the medical role according to Parsons. What does this mean?
- Functional specificity means that doctors act only within their professional competencies and know the limits of their own abilities and should not exploit them. For example, a general practitioner should refer a patient to a specialist as soon as the diagnostic and therapeutic necessities of a case exceed their competencies.

What are the other four behavioral expectations according to the medical role according to Parsons?
- Affective neutrality (suspending sympathies or antipathies towards patients and approaching them neutrally), universalism (treating all people equally), collectivity orientation (altruism), and professional competence.

What is the difference between an inter-role conflict and an intra-role conflict?
- An inter-role conflict is a conflict between two different roles that an individual holds simultaneously (e.g., a doctor in the hospital and mother of two children). An intra-role conflict, on the other hand, is a conflict within a role to which different expectations are attached (e.g., best possible vs. most cost-effective treatment).

What is done in a Balint group?
- In a Balint group, several doctors meet regularly under experienced psychotherapeutic supervision to talk about difficulties arising from dealing with patients.

### The Sick Role

What is meant by the subjective theory of illness?
- The subjective theory of illness refers to the thoughts patients form, based on their knowledge and experiences, about the origin and development of their illness. Such thoughts can influence the course of illness and should therefore always be asked about and considered.

What does causal attribution mean?
- Causal attribution means "attribution of cause". It describes to which causes an event is traced back, e.g., a patient's disease from their perspective. The causes are divided into different dimensions.

What three dimensions of causal attribution are distinguished?
- The following three dimensions of causal attribution are distinguished: the location of the cause (internal or external), the stability of the cause (variable or stable), and the extent of attribution (specific or global).

To what type of causal attribution do depressive people tend?
- Depressive people typically tend to an internal-global-stable causal attribution, i.e., they see the cause for all bad things (global) in themselves (internal) and regard this as an unchangeable fact (stable).

What is meant by control conviction?
- Control conviction reflects the patient's view of who or what can influence the complaints. Three dimensions are distinguished here (internal control conviction, social-external control conviction, external-fatalistic control conviction).

What is the term for a patient's belief that they can influence their symptoms and the course of the illness themselves?
- The belief of a patient that they can influence their complaints and the course of the illness themselves is called internal control conviction. The opposite is external control conviction, where a patient believes other people (e.g., doctors) can influence their complaints and the course of the illness.

What is the term for patients' belief that they can influence their symptoms and the course of the disease?
- Internal control conviction. The opposite is external control conviction, in which patients believe other people (e.g., doctors) can influence their complaints and the course of the illness.

Describe the significance of compliance in contrast to adherence.
- While compliance means the one-sided following of medical instructions by the patients, adherence emphasizes the partnership relationship between doctors and patients. Adherence describes the observance of jointly agreed therapy recommendations within an intact relationship between doctors and patients.

To what extent does the quality of the relationship between doctors and patients influence adherence?
- A good, trusting relationship where doctors take time to explain various treatment options to their patients positively affects adherence. The likelihood that patients implement the jointly agreed therapy recommendations increases significantly.

What is the difference between simulation and dissimulation?
- The difference between simulation and dissimulation is that in simulation, complaints are only feigned, whereas in dissimulation, symptoms are denied or played down.
