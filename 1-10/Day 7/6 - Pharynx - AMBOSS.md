# Pharynx
### Summary

The pharynx (throat) is a tube made of connective tissue and muscle and forms the common beginning of the respiratory and digestive tracts. There are auxiliary structures such as the soft palate (velum palatinum) and the epiglottis (epiglottis) that ensure that the inhaled air is directed into the trachea and the food into the esophagus. The pharynx is divided into three sections: epipharynx, mesopharynx, and hypopharynx. Especially in the epipharynx, there is a lot of lymphatic tissue, which gives the pharynx an important role in immune defense.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function
    - Forwarding of air and food
    - Swallowing act
- Course: From the base of the skull to the cricoid cartilage of the larynx
- Shape: Tubular
- Length: 12-15cm

### Structure

The pharynx is closed at the back and on the sides. However, on its front wall, it has three openings, through which it can be divided into three sections.

- Sections
    1. Nasal part of the pharynx (Epipharynx/Nasopharynx): With connection to the nasal cavity
        - Limitations
            - Ventral: Choanae
                - Connection to the nasal cavity
            - Cranial: Upper pharyngeal wall (Fornix pharyngis)
            - Lateral: Openings of the auditory tube (Pharyngeal orifices of the auditory tubes)
                - Connection to the tympanic cavity
        - Lymphatic tissue
            - Pharyngeal tonsil (unpaired) cranial to the roof of the pharynx
            - Tubal tonsils at the entrance of the auditory tube
    2. Oral part of the pharynx (Mesopharynx/Oropharynx): In connection with the oral cavity
        - Limitations
            - Ventral: Palatine arches
            - Cranial: Soft palate
            - Caudal: Upper edge of the epiglottis
        - Lymphatic tissue: Palatine tonsils
    3. Laryngeal part of the pharynx (Hypopharynx/Laryngopharynx): With a ventral connection to the larynx and a caudal transition to the esophagus
        - Has ventral mucosal grooves (the piriform recesses) that guide food past the entrance of the larynx on both sides during swallowing.
        - Limitations
            - Ventral: Laryngeal inlet (Aditus laryngis)
            - Cranial: Upper edge of the laryngeal cover
            - Dorsal: Esophageal opening (Pharyngo-esophageal constriction)
                - Connection to the esophagus

### Topography

The pharynx is suspended at the base of the skull and extends to the entrance of the esophagus. It connects to the nasal cavity through the choanae, to the middle ear through the auditory tube, and to the oral cavity through the isthmus of the fauces. Additionally, it has direct connections to the trachea and esophagus.

## Pharyngeal Muscles (Pharynx Musculature)

For a smooth swallowing process, the pharynx has two different muscle groups: the constrictor muscles with a circular arrangement and the elevator muscles with longitudinal fibers. They are presented in the following table (to deactivate the "Physikum-Focus" for the origin and insertion of the muscles, simply click on the green vignette in the top right corner of the chapter).

## Microscopic Anatomy

According to their affiliation with the respiratory and/or digestive tract, the three sections of the pharynx have different epithelia. The entire pharynx contains diffusely distributed lymphatic tissue and is therefore part of the MALT. In conjunction with the tonsils located in the pharynx, this is referred to as the Waldeyer's ring of the pharynx.

- Nasal part of the pharynx: Upper airway
    - Epithelium: Pseudostratified respiratory ciliated epithelium with goblet cells
    - Glands: Seromucous glands
    - Lymphatic tissue
        - Pharyngeal tonsil
        - Tubal tonsils
- Oral part of the pharynx: Air and food passage
    - Epithelium: Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
    - Glands: Mucous glands (Pharyngeal glands)
    - Lymphatic tissue: Palatine tonsil
- Laryngeal pharynx: Air and food passage
    - Epithelium: Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
    - Glands: Mucous glands (Pharyngeal glands)

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to the rest of the digestive tract, the pharynx has no lamina muscularis mucosae!

## Waldeyer's Ring

The pharyngeal entrance is surrounded by lymphatic tissue with tonsils - the Waldeyer's ring.

- Components of the Waldeyer's Ring of Lymphoid Tissue
    - Pharyngeal tonsil (adenoid)
    - Tonsilla tubaria (tubal tonsil), which extends into the so-called lateral pharyngeal bands in the lateral wall of the pharynx.
    - Palatine tonsil (palatine tonsil)
    - Lingual tonsil: Located in the mucous membrane of the tongue's base
    - Side branches in the mucosa

## Function

The pharynx serves as the pathway for air and food toward the trachea and esophagus, respectively, and plays an important role in the act of swallowing.

### Swallowing Act
The act of swallowing can be divided into three phases.

| **Phase** | **Involved Structures**                          | **Mechanism**                                  | **Effect**                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Phase** | - M. constrictor pharyngis superior<br>- M. levator veli palatini<br>- M. tensor veli palatini | - Forms the Passavant's ridge<br>- Elevates and tenses the soft palate | - Closes the upper airways in conjunction with M. levator veli palatini and M. tensor veli palatini → Prevents the passage of food into the nasal cavity<br>- Opens the tube ostium<br>- Closes the upper airways in conjunction with M. constrictor pharyngis superior → Prevents the passage of food into the nasal cavity |
| **2. Phase** | - Suprahyoid Musculature<br>- Mm. styloglossus and hyoglossus | - Elevates the larynx<br>- Compresses the base of the tongue<br>- Shifts the tongue backwards | - Closes the laryngeal entrance → Prevents the passage of food into the airways<br>- Distributes the food into the deeper pharyngeal parts |
| **3. Phase** | - M. constrictor pharyngis medius<br>- M. constrictor pharyngis inferior<br>- Receptive field at the posterior wall of the pharynx | - Contracts<br>- Incoming food triggers involuntary peristalsis | - Pushes food through the pharyngeal tube<br>- Directs the food towards the esophagus |

## Review Questions on the Chapter Pharynx
### Macroscopic Anatomy

In which section of the pharynx are the so-called piriform recesses located, and what function do they serve?
- The pharynx is divided into three sections: epipharynx, mesopharynx, and hypopharynx. The hypopharynx (also called pars laryngea pharyngis, laryngopharynx) transitions caudally into the esophagus and is ventrally connected to the larynx. On the ventral side of the hypopharynx lie the piriform recesses. These are mucosal grooves that guide food on both sides of the laryngeal inlet during swallowing.

### Pharyngeal Muscles (Pharynx Musculature)

Through which muscle and which other structure is the entry of food into the nasal cavity prevented?
- The superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle (M. constrictor pharyngis superior) forms the so-called Passavant’s ridge at the level of the soft palate through contraction. This ridge, together with the soft palate, closes off the nasopharynx during swallowing and thus prevents food from entering the nasal cavity.

Through which nerves are the pharyngeal constrictors and elevators innervated?
- The pharyngeal constrictor muscles are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus, which is formed by branches of the vagus nerve (including the superior laryngeal nerve) and the glossopharyngeal nerve, as well as by the superior cervical ganglion. The innervation of the pharyngeal elevators is provided by the glossopharyngeal nerve (M. stylopharyngeus) and the pharyngeal plexus (M. salpingopharyngeus and M. palatopharyngeus).

### Microscopic Anatomy

What is the name of the lymphatic tissue located in the nasopharynx (epipharynx)?
- In the epipharynx lie three accumulations of lymphatic tissue: the pharyngeal tonsil (tonsilla pharyngealis) and the paired tubal tonsils (tonsillae tubariae).
