# Resting and Action Potential
## Summary

The interplay of different tissues or organs requires good coordination between individual cells and often very fast communication over long distances. Rapid cell communication can be ensured by the transmission of electrochemical signals. For this purpose, charged particles, known as ions, are transported, and their distribution in cells is precisely controlled. If this leads to a change in the cell's charge, it is referred to as electrogenic transport. In contrast, during electroneutral transport, either only uncharged substances are transported, or the transported charges cancel each other out, so that the overall charge of the cell remains unchanged.
Through the distribution of charge carriers along the cell membrane, a potential difference is established, which is referred to as the resting potential, and energy must be expended to maintain it. The transport of charge carriers through a cell membrane leads to a change in the potential along the membrane and can be purposefully used to transmit information. If the potential change is large enough, a so-called action potential forms.

## Charge distribution inside and outside the cell

Since different charged ions (see also: electrolytes) are present in varying concentrations inside and outside of cells, there is a characteristic charge distribution at cell membranes – a "potential." In addition to classical electrolytes, negatively charged proteins (especially intracellularly) contribute to the charge distribution. In the following, concentration values for the most important extra- and intracellular charge carriers are provided based on the idealized model of a nerve cell.

### Chemical Basics of Excitation Conduction

An ion solution conducts electricity. The determining factor for the speed of ion transport is the electric field strength. It is quantified by the ionic strength, which takes into account both the concentration of the ions and their charge.

- Ionic strength: Measure of the strength of the electric field generated by ions in a solution.
    - Formula: Ic = ½ × Σci × zi2
        - I = ionic strength, ci = concentration of ions i, zi = charge of ions i
- Molar conductivity: Electrical conductivity of an electrolyte solution relative to the concentration of the solution.
    - Formula: Λm = Λm0 - K × √c
        - Unit: S × cm2/mol
        - Λm = Molar conductivity, Λm0 = Molar standard conductivity, K = Constant, c = Ion concentration
- Electrochemical potential: Indicates how much work must be done to increase the amount of ion species i at constant temperature and pressure.
    - Formula: μ̄i = μi + z × F × φ
        - μ̄i = electrochemical potential, μi = chemical potential, z = charge, F = Faraday constant, φ = electric potential
- Potential calculations on biomembranes: If there is a concentration gradient of ions across a membrane, a voltage (membrane potential) is generated due to the charge difference on both sides of the membrane. This can be determined using two equations:
    - Nernst equation: In the case of a concentration gradient of a specific ion type
        - Formula: UG = (60 mV / z) × log(cextern / cintern)
            - UG = equilibrium potential, z = charge of the considered ions, cextern = concentration of the ions outside the cell, cintern = concentration of the ions inside the cell
            - Derived from the Nernst equation for concentration cells
    - Goldman equation: In the case of a concentration gradient of several ion types
        - Formula: UM = RT / F × ln((PNa × cNa,ext + PK × cK,ext + PCl × cCl,int) / (PNa × cNa,int + PK × cK,int + PCl × cCl,ext))
            - UM = membrane potential, R = gas constant, T = temperature, F = Faraday constant, P = permeability of the membrane for the respective ion, cext = concentration of ions outside the cell, cint = concentration of ions inside the cell
            - The Goldman equation is derived from the Nernst equation for concentration cells (see above)
- Ion flow
    - Describes the flow rate of ions depending on how well ions can pass through a membrane, and from a voltage difference on both sides of the membrane as a driving force for ion movement.
    - At the so-called reversal potential, there is no ion flow: reversal potential = equilibrium potential of a specific ion
    - Formula: Ion flow J = Membrane conductivity Λ × driving voltage difference ΔU

### Physical Fundamentals of Excitation Conduction

Electrical currents flow along cell membranes between excited and non-excited membrane sections. Electrophysical laws can be applied to describe this "current flow."

#### Principle

- Depolarization of the membrane: Voltage at a section of the membrane becomes more positive on the inside due to an influx of cations.
- Electronic forwarding
    - Depolarization of a membrane section automatically leads to depolarization of neighboring areas (passively)
    - This effect can be described using the membrane resistance (in nerve cells, any existing insulation by myelin sheaths and the internal longitudinal resistance must also be considered) and the shape of the electrical conductor (axon diameter = thickness of the nerve cell extension)

#### Physical Laws for Nerve Impulse Conduction Along a Cell Membrane

The laws are derived from cable theory.

- Longitudinal resistance Ri
    - Definition: Resistance that the cytosol exerts against a longitudinal movement of charge carriers
    - Formula: Ri = ρ × l / A
        - Ri = Resistance, ρ = specific resistance, l = Length, A = cross-sectional area
        - Unit: Ω (Ohm)
    - Influence on excitation spread: The lower the longitudinal resistance, the better and faster the excitation spread.
    - Influence of nerve fiber thickness: The thicker a nerve fiber is, the lower the longitudinal resistance.
- Membrane resistance RM
    - Definition: Resistance of a cell membrane against the passage of charge carriers
    - Influence on excitation propagation: The higher the membrane resistance, the better the excitation conduction (less loss of charge carriers)
    - Influence of nerve fiber thickness: The thicker a nerve fiber is, the lower the membrane resistance (as this also increases the surface area of the nerve fiber, making the passage of particles through the membrane easier).
- Membrane longitudinal constant λ
    - Definition: Distance from a stimulus site at which the electric potential has dropped to only 37% of its original amplitude.
    - Calculation: From internal longitudinal resistance and the membrane resistance
- Membrane capacity CM
    - Definition: Membranes of nerve fibers act as a type of capacitor and can hold a certain amount of electrical charge, which is not further transmitted by the membrane.
    - Formula: CM = Q / U
        - CM = Membrane capacity, Q = Charge amount, U = Voltage
    - Unit: F (Farad = Coulomb / Volt)
    - Influence on the spread of excitation: The higher the membrane capacitance, the poorer the conduction of excitation.
    - Influence of nerve fiber thickness: The thicker a nerve fiber, the greater the membrane capacitance (since a larger surface area of the nerve fiber increases the area where a voltage can build up)
- Membrane time constant τ
    - Definition: Time during which the membrane potential has fallen to 37% of the maximum potential or has risen to 63% of the maximum potential.
    - Calculation: Product of membrane resistance and membrane capacitance
    - Formula: τ = RM × CM
        - τ = membrane time constant, RM = membrane resistance, CM = membrane capacitance
    - Unit: s (Ω × F)

Membrane resistance and capacitance are inversely proportional to each other (the higher the resistance, the lower the capacitance)!

For the internodes, this means that a high membrane resistance, a low membrane capacitance, and a low internal longitudinal resistance increase the conduction velocity of an electrical potential!

The conduction velocity in continuous impulse conduction is proportional to the radius of the nerve fiber – the thicker the nerve, the faster the continuous impulse conduction!

## The Resting Potential

The resting potential (RP) is the membrane potential of an excitable cell (e.g., nerve cells or muscle cells) at rest. It is thus the "baseline" state, which corresponds more or less to the sum of all diffusion potentials (i.e., potentials in a steady state) of the ions present intracellularly and extracellularly (see above: charge distribution in the cell). Depending on the cell type, the RP varies in magnitude, ranging from approximately -70mV to -90mV.

- Fundamentals of RP
    - Brownian motion: Particles move randomly and tend to achieve a uniform distribution.
    - Semipermeable Membrane: Due to the presence of ion channels (including an inward rectifying K+ channel) with selective transport capability, cell membranes are in a resting state
        - Highly permeable to K+ ions (some also for Cl– ions)
        - Poorly permeable to Na+-ions
        - Impermeable to anionic proteins
    - Sodium-Potassium-ATPase and ion channels: Actively maintain the resting potential.
        - K+ concentration: Intracellular > extracellular
        - Na+ concentration: extracellular > intracellular

The resting potential more or less corresponds to the K+-equilibrium potential, which varies according to the ion channels present in the cell: Neurons ≈ -70mV, muscle cells (skeletal and cardiac) ≈ -90mV, glial cells ≈ -90mV!
## The Action Potential

The charge along a membrane cannot be shielded by it, leading to the formation of a diffusion potential at the membrane, which is called the resting potential. It is normally -70 mV. Electrochemical communication occurs by changing this resting potential. This change is referred to as the action potential; it typically arises in a similar manner. An exception is the cardiac muscle cells, whose action potentials look and are formed differently. For details, see: Cardiac Excitation.

To exceed the threshold potential and trigger an action potential, the membrane potential of a nerve cell must be shifted by about 10–30 mV!

Ion flow that occurs uncontrollably and is solely due to the degradation of the concentration gradient is referred to as leakage current!

Epileptic seizure
During an epileptic seizure, there are synchronous, high-frequency discharges of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex. Due to the high action potential frequency, the ion flows (high potassium extracellular, high sodium intracellular) can no longer be completely balanced by the relatively slow Na+/K+-ATPase towards the resting membrane potential (high potassium intracellular, high sodium extracellular). The K+ concentration consequently increases extracellularly. Additionally, there is an increased consumption of oxygen and energy as well as an increased release of glutamate.

Sodium channel blocker
A blockade of voltage-dependent Na+ channels prevents the generation and conduction of action potentials. Sodium channel blockers are therapeutically used, for example, as local anesthetics or antiarrhythmics, but can also lead to poisoning (especially saxitoxin) through the consumption of contaminated seafood.

#### Duration of Action Potentials

The duration of an action potential depends on the type of cell it is. The most important ones are compiled here.

|Cell Type|Duration of AP|
|---|---|
|Neurons|approx. 1 ms|
|Skeletal muscle cell|approx. 10 ms|
|Heart muscle cell|approx. 300 ms|

#### Control of the Generation of Action Potentials

The membrane potential reached during depolarization does not indicate the strength of a stimulus; the electrochemical signal transmission is always an all-or-nothing reaction. An action potential always leads completely (or not at all) to a depolarization of the membrane. The strength of a stimulus is only represented by the frequency of successive action potentials.

- Indication of stimulus intensity in relation to the voltage
    - Threshold potential: Measure of the voltage difference from the net charges on both sides of a cell membrane
        - Is around -50 mV
        - Potential that must be reached to trigger an action potential
        - If it is exceeded, all voltage-dependent Na+ channels are activated and an action potential is triggered.
- Indication of stimulus intensity related to current intensity
    - Rheobase: Minimum current strength at which an action potential is triggered
    - Chronaxie: Minimum time span in which an action potential is triggered at double rheobase strength.

#### Propagation of Action Potentials

The generation of an action potential through the opening of ion channels and the resulting depolarization is a local event. To use an action potential as a stimulus for communication, it must be directed, i.e., transmitted in only one direction. A "backflow" of the stimulus is prevented by the refractory period of the responsible sodium channels. The conduction of excitation occurs either quickly - along myelinated nerve fibers through so-called saltatory conduction - or slowly along unmyelinated nerve fibers via continuous conduction.

- Continuous excitation conduction: Slow stimulus conduction along an unmyelinated nerve fiber (unmyelinated)
    - Triggering of the action potential: At any membrane area where the threshold potential is exceeded
    - Transport of the action potential: Depolarization of the membrane area causes the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels in a neighboring area (depolarization "moves" along the cell membrane)
- Saltatory conduction: Rapid signal transmission along a myelinated nerve fiber (myelinated) through glial cells.
    - Triggering of the action potential: Only in non-isolated membrane areas (Nodes of Ranvier), where the threshold potential is exceeded
    - Transport of the action potential: Depolarization of a node of Ranvier leads to the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels at the next node of Ranvier (depolarization "jumps" along the cell membrane)
    - Physical effects: The internodes reduce the membrane capacitance and increase the membrane length constant (see also: Physical laws for the conduction of impulses along a cell membrane).

Since the transmission speed along a nerve mainly depends on the electrical insulation provided by myelin sheaths, the following holds true: The thicker the myelin sheath, the faster the conduction of excitation!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Resting and Action Potential
### Charge distribution inside and outside the cell
Describe the extracellular and intracellular concentration ratios for the ions Na+, K+, Ca2+, H+, and Cl- at rest.
*   Of the ions mentioned (except K+ and H+), the extracellular concentration is always higher than the intracellular concentration. The exact numerical values vary depending on the cell type. For calcium, the difference between intracellular and extracellular concentration is the greatest.
    
What is the decisive driving force for the transport of ions in solution?
*   Ions distribute in solution just like molecules as evenly as possible (principle of entropy) and thus against any existing concentration gradient. However, the speed of ion movement is not determined solely by the concentration, because the charge of the ions creates an electric field in which the individual ions are accelerated according to their charge. The prevailing driving force for ion movement is therefore the electric field strength at the ion's location.
    
How can the ion flow across a membrane be described?
*   Two aspects must be considered for ion flow across a membrane: on the one hand, the different charge densities on the two sides of the membrane, which act as the driving force for movement and can be quantified as a voltage difference, and on the other hand, the conductivity (permeability) of the membrane for the respective ion. The product of these two values results in the ion flow across the membrane.
    
What is the Nernst equation, and what relationship for cells can be described with it?
*   The Nernst equation was developed to describe the voltage conditions in a galvanic element. When transferring the situation to cells, the fluid compartments on the two sides of a membrane (intracellular space and extracellular space) can be understood as concentration half-cells of a galvanic element. With the formula UG = (60 mV / z) × log(cextern / cintern), UG = equilibrium potential, z = charge of the ion considered, cextern = concentration of the ions outside the cell, cintern = concentration of the ions inside the cell, the voltage that builds up for a certain ion species along a membrane can be calculated.
    
With which electrical component can nerve fibers be compared and why? What special feature arises from this for myelinated nerve fibers?
*   Nerve cells can be well compared to a capacitor because charge can be stored on both sides of the cell membrane. Therefore, the capacitor equation (capacitance = charge / voltage) can also be used for nerve cells. The amount of charge that can be stored depends on the thickness of the nerve fibers. A larger surface area can hold more charge; at the same time, the internal longitudinal resistance decreases proportionally in thicker nerve fibers. Therefore, the conduction velocity does not decrease even in thicker nerve fibers. Myelin sheaths act like insulation; they increase membrane resistance and reduce membrane capacitance – thereby preventing charge passage and allowing a continuous ion current along the internodes up to the next node of Ranvier. The myelin sheaths provide better electronic propagation of excitation and faster spread of excitation.
    
### The Action Potential
Describe the cellular processes during the different phases of an action potential.
*   An action potential (AP) usually arises from the excitable resting state of a nerve cell, in which sodium and potassium ions are in a steady-state flow equilibrium and there is a negative charge inside and a positive charge outside the cell. The formation of an AP begins with the opening of sodium channels in the membrane, resulting in an initial influx of Na+ into the cell and raising the cell potential to about -50 mV. The potassium channels in the membrane begin to close. Once the so-called threshold potential of about -55 mV inside the cell is exceeded, additional voltage-dependent sodium channels open, causing a rapid depolarization of the cell to about +30 mV, a value near the equilibrium potential of Na+ (about +60 mV). The potassium channels are almost completely closed. A reversal of charge distribution has occurred: the inside of the cell is now positively charged, and the outside negatively charged. The peak of the cell’s depolarization is also called overshoot and is characterized by the fact that the Na+ channels have already begun to close again. The cell then slowly returns to its resting state, called repolarization. Voltage-dependent potassium channels in the membrane open, causing an efflux of K+. Due to the decrease in positive charge inside the cell, the closure of voltage-dependent Na+ channels is further promoted. Before the cell returns to its resting state, there is a brief phase of hyperpolarization during which the potential falls below the resting potential and the cell slowly approaches the equilibrium potential of K+ (about -90 mV). In this phase, some K+ channels remain open because calcium that flowed in during depolarization is slowly removed from the cell. The physiological purpose of hyperpolarization is to increase the stimulus threshold during the so-called refractory period and thus prevent the backward propagation of an AP in the wrong direction. The time during which a cell is completely unexcitable is called the absolute refractory period. The refractory period, on the other hand, is the time during which the cell can be excited again. However, this is more difficult than in the resting state, because some Na+ channels can already reopen, but the cell potential is still below resting potential.
    
How long does an action potential last?
*   The duration of an action potential varies depending on cell type and ranges in humans from about 1 ms in neurons to about 300 ms in heart muscle cells.
    
How is the strength of a stimulus encoded using action potentials?
*   Because an action potential (AP) is an all-or-nothing reaction, the strength of a stimulus cannot be transmitted by the size of a potential or the concentration of an ion. Instead, the strength of a stimulus is encoded by the frequency of consecutive APs. The stronger the stimulus, the higher the frequency of the APs.
