# Blood and Blood Cells
## Summary

The blood connects all organs of the body and enables the exchange of nutrients and hormones. The functions of blood are mediated, on the one hand, by the proteins dissolved in plasma (plasma proteins), and on the other hand, by special blood cells (erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and leukocytes). The cells of the blood are formed in the bone marrow as part of blood formation (hematopoiesis). The plasma proteins are mostly synthesized in the liver and can be classified into five fractions based on their chemical properties.

## Tasks and Composition of Blood

About the blood, all organs of the body are interconnected. It consists of water with many dissolved proteins (= plasma) as well as blood cells, of which there are three main types. Blood makes up 6-8% of body weight, so for example, a person weighing 70 kg has approximately five liters of blood.

### The Functions of Blood

- Transport
    - Gas
        - O2 to the organs
        - CO2 to the lungs
    - Nutrients and hormones to target organs
    - Toxic substances to the liver and kidneys
    - Heat: Distribution in the body
- Hemostasis
- Immune defense
- Regulation of the acid-base balance

### The Composition of Blood

#### Plasma volume: 55%

Plasma is the liquid, cell-free component of blood that is obtained after centrifugation: the cells settle at the bottom of the blood tube and the clear yellow supernatant corresponds to the plasma.

- 90% Water
- 10% Solutes
    - 70% plasma proteins
    - 20% Low Molecular Weight Substances
    - 10% Electrolytes

#### Cell volume: 45%

- 99% Erythrocytes
- About 1% platelets and leukocytes

> [!NOTE]
> Plasma is obtained by centrifugation of uncoagulated blood; it contains all the proteins of the blood! Serum is obtained after centrifugation of coagulated blood; it no longer contains fibrinogen and clotting factors! Plasma thus has a higher protein content than serum!

> [!NOTE] Blood purification
> Blood purification (i.e., plasmapheresis) refers to a medical procedure in which blood is continuously drawn from the affected person via a venous catheter over a period of up to four hours using a pump. The blood is then separated into plasma and cellular components outside the body. From the plasma, disease-causing components (e.g., autoantibodies) can be removed (therapeutic apheresis). At the same time, the already "purified" plasma, along with blood cells and albumin and infusion solutions (to compensate for volume losses), is returned to the patient's bloodstream through a second venous catheter.

## Plasma Proteins

To date, about 1,000 different plasma proteins have been analyzed, which are divided into five fractions based on their electrophoretic separation and perform numerous functions in the blood. Plasma proteins buffer the pH level, transport water-insoluble substances, and are essential components of blood coagulation as well as fibrinolysis. In this section, the various fractions of plasma proteins along with their general and specific functions will be presented.

### General Information about Plasma Proteins

- Definition: A group of water-soluble proteins that circulate in the plasma and perform special functions in the blood.
- Classification
    - A total of about 1,000 different identified plasma proteins
    - Divided into five plasma protein fractions
- Concentration: 60–80 g/L Plasma
- Biochemical Properties
    - Water-soluble/hydrophilic
    - About 40% have a globular structure
- Synthesis
    - The majority of plasma proteins are synthesized in the liver.
    - The γ-globulins are synthesized in the plasma cells.
- General Functions
    - pH stability of the blood
    - Transport of poorly water-soluble (lipophilic) substances
    - Energy supplier
    - Oncotic pressure

#### Oncotic Pressure (= Colloid Osmotic Pressure = COP)

- Definition: Refers to the osmotic pressure caused by the colloids in blood plasma.
- Normal value: 25 mmHg (= 3.3 kPa)
- Meaning
    - The KOD prevents excessive leakage of plasma from the blood vessels into the interstitium → Cf. Effective Filtration Pressure
    - Lowered KOD → Water accumulation in the tissue (= edema)

#### The five plasma protein fractions

To differentiate and examine plasma proteins more closely, they are separated using serum electrophoresis. Blood plasma is applied to a support material (agarose gel or cellulose acetate film) and then an electric voltage is applied to the gel. The plasma proteins now migrate through the support material depending on their charge and size, and are separated into five characteristic groups in this way. The following tables present the most important representatives of the fractions. For pathological changes in plasma protein fractions, see: serum electrophoresis.

|Faction|Share and Plasma Concentration|Representatives|Tasks|
|---|---|---|---|
|Albumin|- 60% of total proteins<br>- Plasma concentration approx. 40 g/L|Albumin|- Due to the high concentration in plasma → Main contribution (more than 80%) to the maintenance of colloid osmotic pressure<br>- Transport<br>    - Free fatty acids<br>    - Bilirubin<br>    - Ca2+-ions|
|α1-Globulin|- 4% of total proteins<br>- Plasma concentration approx. 3 g/L|α1-Antitrypsin|- Inhibition of the protease trypsin|
|α1-Lipoprotein (=HDL)|- Transport of cholesterol from the periphery to the liver|
|Thyroxine-binding globulin (=TBG)|- Transport of thyroxine (=T4) and triiodothyronine (=T3)|
|Prothrombin|- Blood coagulation: Precursor of Factor II (=Thrombin)|
|Transcortin|- Transport of cortisone and progesterone|
|α2-Globulin|- 8% of total proteins<br>- Plasma concentration approx. 6 g/L|α2-Macroglobulin|- Inhibition of many proteases|
|Antithrombin|- Anticoagulant of blood coagulation|
|Cholinesterase|- Breakdown of choline esters|
|Ceruloplasmin|- Transport of Cu2+ ions|
|Haptoglobin|- Binding/Transport of Hemoglobin|
|Plasminogen|- Precursor of the protease Plasmin|
|β-Globulin|- 12% of total proteins<br>- Plasma concentration approx. 10 g/L|β-Lipoprotein (=LDL)|- Transport of cholesterol from the liver to the periphery|
|C3 and C4 complement| - Part of the complement system|
|Fibrinogen|- Blood coagulation: Precursor of Factor I (=Fibrin)|
|Haptoglobin|- Binding/Transport of heme molecules|
|Transferrin|- Transport of Fe3+-ions|
|γ-Globulin|- 16% of total proteins<br>- Plasma concentration about 13 g/L|Immunoglobulins|- Immune defense|

> [!NOTE]
> Albumin forms the largest fraction as the most common plasma protein, making up about 60% of the total protein concentration. The sizes of the other fractions can easily be remembered using the so-called 4-rule. α1 starts with 4%, the proportion of the subsequent fractions increases in 4% increments: 8% (α2), 12% (β), and 16% (γ).

> [!NOTE] Hunger edema
> In those countries of the Global South where parts of the population suffer from malnutrition, one often sees children with notably distended bellies (or medically: abdomens). This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon is referred to as "hunger belly." It occurs when children are weaned off the protein-rich breast milk and can only consume a diet low in protein. Due to the lack of amino acids in the food, there is a decrease in albumin synthesis in the liver. Consequently, the oncotic pressure of the plasma drops, leading to an increased outflow of plasma into the tissues and body cavities – the described hunger belly emerges.

### Pathological Changes of the Protein Fractions

The following table is meant to show the characteristic changes in plasma protein composition that occur in certain disease conditions.

| Acute Inflammation        | α1, α2                     | Albumin    | - Increase of acute-phase proteins in serum during infection<br>- Decrease of negative acute-phase proteins (including Albumin) during infection                                                                                                               |
| α1-Antitrypsin deficiency | –                          | α1         | - α1-Antitrypsin is a representative of the α1 fraction, which is therefore reduced                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Liver Cirrhosis           | γ                          | Albumin    | - Increase in the γ-fraction due to nonspecific activation of the reticuloendothelial system in liver cirrhosis<br>- Decrease in albumin due to reduced synthesis capacity of the liver                                                                        |

## Low Molecular Weight Substances and Electrolytes

In plasma, in addition to the relatively large plasma proteins, there are many other molecules that have a lower molecular weight. These so-called low molecular weight substances include, among others, glucose (blood sugar), metabolic products such as urea, and also electrolytes such as chloride or sodium. For more information on the clinical relevance of electrolytes, see: Laboratory Medicine.

### Low Molecular Weight Substances

|Substance|   |Plasma concentration (Normal range) in mmol/L|
|---|---|---|
|Glucose|   |- Fasting<br>    - 2.8–5.5 mmol/L<br>    - 50–99 mg/dL|
|Lactate|   |0.6–2.4|
|Urea|   |2.0–8.0|
|Creatinine|   |0.08–0.1|

### Electrolytes

|Substance|   |Plasma concentration (Normal range) in mmol/L|
|---|---|---|
|Anions|Chloride|97–108|
|Bicarbonate|22–26|
|Inorganic phosphate|0.87–1.67|
|Cations|Sodium|135–145|
|Potassium|3.5–5.1|
|Calcium|- Total concentration: 2.2–2.6<br>- Free Calcium: 1.12–1.32|
|Magnesium|0.65–1.05|

#### Anion gap

The anion gap is a value calculated from electrolyte concentrations, which is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of acidosis (→ acid-base balance).

#### Osmolality of Plasma

- Definition: Refers to the number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of plasma water.
- Normal value: 290 mOsm/kg [H2O]
- Meaning: Plasma substitutes (e.g. infusions for volume deficiency) must match the osmolality of plasma.
    - A 0.9% saline infusion solution (= isotonic or physiological NaCl solution) has the same osmolality as blood plasma.
- Formula: Plasma osmolality = 2 x Plasma-Na+ + Plasma glucose + Plasma urea

> [!NOTE]
> Among the cations, sodium (Na+) and among the anions, chloride (Cl−) have the highest concentration in the plasma!

## Blood Cells

### The Cells of Blood at a Glance

|Cell Type|   |Relative Proportion of Total Volume of All Blood Cells|Normal Range in Cells/Microliter (μL)|   |Main Function|Lifespan|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Erythrocytes|   |Approx. 99%|♀: 4.0–5.5 million|♂: 4.6–6.0 million|O2 transport (see: Erythrocytes)|Approx. 120 d|
|Platelets|   |<1%|150,000–400,000|   |Hemostasis|Approx. 5–12 d|
|Leukocytes|   |<1%|4,000–10,500|   |Immune defense (see: Nonspecific immune system, Specific immune system)|Variable: From a few days (granulocytes) to several months/years (certain lymphocytes)|

### Frequency of Leukocyte Subtypes

|Cell Type|   |Relative Proportion of Total Leukocytes|Normal Range in Cells/Microliter (μL)|   |Main Function|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Granulocytes|Neutrophils|40–60%|3,000–5,500|   |Defense against bacterial infections, phagocytosis|
|Eosinophils|1–3%|50–350|   |Defense against parasitic infections|
|Basophils|0–1%|15–50|   |Histamine and Serotonin Release|
|Lymphocytes|   |20–40%|1,500–3,000|   |Acquired (adaptive) immune system|
|Monocytes|   |4–8%|300–500|   |Differentiate in tissues to macrophages|

> [!NOTE]
> An increase in leukocytes above the normal range (>10,000/μL) is called leukocytosis, while a decrease in the leukocyte count below the normal range (<4,000/μL) is referred to as leukopenia!

> [!NOTE]
> Mnemonic for memorizing the frequency ranking of leukocytes: "Never Let Monkeys Eat Bananas" (Neutrophils > Lymphocytes > Monocytes > Eosinophils > Basophils)! To learn the percentage values for the frequencies, one can remember a simple sequence of numbers: 60 – 30 – 6 – 3 – 0.6!

> [!NOTE]
> Keyword for sorting by cell diameter: "TELyGraM" (sorting by size, starting with the smallest cell: platelet < erythrocyte < lymphocyte < granulocyte < monocyte)!

> [!NOTE] Differential blood count
> During a routine blood examination, a so-called "complete blood count" is usually ordered. This involves determining the cell counts of erythrocytes, platelets, and total leukocytes, as well as hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, and erythrocyte indices (MCH, MCHC, MCV). If the leukocytes are either particularly elevated (leukocytosis) or decreased (leukopenia), it may be sensible to order a so-called differential blood count in the laboratory. In this blood test, not only is the total number of leukocytes measured, but the individual types of leukocytes are distinguished or differentiated during the counting - hence the term "differential blood count." When a complete blood count is ordered along with a differential blood count, it is also referred to in clinical practice as a "comprehensive blood count."

> [!NOTE] Eosinophilia
> With an eosinophil count in the blood of more than 360 cells/μL, one speaks of "eosinophilia." Among the two most common triggers for eosinophilia are allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma, or parasitic diseases, such as worm infections or infestations by skin mites. In allergies, an increased release of the hormone histamine from mast cells leads to enhanced maturation and migration of eosinophilic granulocytes from the bone marrow into the blood.

## Blood Types

On the surface of the erythrocyte membrane, there are antigens against which the immune system can produce antibodies. Two blood group systems are of particular clinical relevance: the ABO system and the Rh system.

In the case of an unknown blood type of the patient, red blood cell concentrate of blood type O Rh-negative should be transfused. In the same case, Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) of blood type AB should be transfused if necessary (Rh-positive if possible; if not, also Rh-negative; caution is advised for women of childbearing age due to Rh sensitization).

#### Bedside-Test

The bedside test checks whether the patient's recipient antigens match the declared blood type. This is the last opportunity to prevent a hemolytic transfusion reaction due to an ABO incompatibility.

- Indication: Immediately before transfusion, the bedside test must be conducted by the transfusing physician or under their direct supervision, and the result must be documented in writing.
- Implementation: Injection of patient blood into the two test fields "Anti-A" and "Anti-B" (possibly additionally testing stored blood separately)
- Result: Agglutination (clumping) of a test field → Detection of the corresponding antigen

| Blood Type | Test Fields |          |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Anti-A     | Anti-B      |          |
| 0          | Negative    | Negative |
| A          | Positive    | Negative |
| B          | Negative    | Positive |
| AB         | Positive    | Positive |

> [!NOTE]
> "What you see is what you get!" (Agglutination in the Anti-A test field → Patient has blood type A; Agglutination in the Anti-B test field → Blood type B, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> The blood type "O negative" is a universal donor for red blood cells and a universal recipient for plasma! The blood type "AB positive" is a universal donor for plasma and a universal recipient for red blood cells!

### Rhesus Blood Group System

- Rhesus system gene
    - There are 6 alleles: C, c, D, d, E, e
    - d = not a real gene, describes the deletion of gene D
    - Inheritance
        - Codominant factors: C, c, D, E, e
        - Dominant factors: D is dominant over d
- Rhesus factor: The D gene leads to the formation of the D antigen, which is referred to as the "Rhesus factor."
    - One is Rhesus positive (Rh+) if one has the genotype "DD" or "Dd"
        - 85% of the European population are Rh-positive
    - One is Rhesus-negative (Rh−) if one has the genotype "dd".
- Most important antibody: Anti-D antibody
    - The antibody is produced only by Rh-negative individuals when they have been exposed to Rh-positive erythrocytes through Rh-positive pregnancy or transfusion.
- Examples
    - "A+" means blood type A, Rh factor positive
        - Antigen A and at least one D allele
        - Antibodies: Anti-B antibodies present, Anti-D antibodies not present
    - "B−" means blood type B, Rh factor negative
        - Antigen B, no D allele (genotype dd = two deleted D genes)
        - Antibodies: Anti-A antibodies present, Anti-D antibodies only present if there has already been contact with Rh-positive erythrocytes.

> [!NOTE] Rhesus incompatibility during pregnancy
> The placental transfer of anti-Rh antibodies plays a role when a Rh-negative woman is pregnant with a Rh-positive child. In response to the Rh factor of the fetal erythrocytes, which are transferred in small amounts at the latest during birth, the mother would produce anti-Rh antibodies (=anti-D antibodies). In a subsequent pregnancy with a Rh-positive child, these antibodies could cross the placental barrier and lead to the destruction (hemolysis) of fetal erythrocytes (so-called neonatal hemolytic disease). To prevent the formation of these antibodies, mothers are administered a so-called Rh prophylaxis after the birth of their first Rh-positive child.

> [!NOTE] Rhesus prophylaxis
> Every pregnant woman in Germany receives a maternity passport upon confirmation of pregnancy, which also records the blood type of the pregnant woman. If she is Rh-negative with an Rh-positive fetus (detectable via NIPT-RhD), the pregnant woman must receive Rh prophylaxis. This consists of two intramuscular injections of anti-D immunoglobulin, the first at 28 weeks of gestation. The aim is to prevent any Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes that may enter the maternal circulation from sensitizing the mother and leading to the subsequent formation of anti-Rh antibodies. The administered anti-D immunoglobulin can bind to the Rh factor and facilitate the rapid breakdown of the cells. While anti-D immunoglobulins do cross the placental barrier (IgG antibodies) during Rh prophylaxis, the administered dose is too small to cause significant damage to the erythrocytes in the circulation of the Rh-positive unborn child. A second injection of anti-D immunoglobulin is given a few hours after birth. Rh prophylaxis must also be remembered for Rh-negative pregnant women after a miscarriage or prior to procedures for prenatal diagnostics (e.g., chorionic villus sampling)!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Blood and Blood Cells
### Functions and Composition of Blood

How do blood serum and blood plasma differ in their composition?
- Plasma is the liquid, cell-free part of the blood that is obtained after centrifugation of non-coagulated blood. Blood serum is obtained after centrifugation of coagulated blood, i.e., it contains all components of plasma except the coagulation factors and fibrinogen. Plasma thus has a higher protein content than serum.
Explain how plasma volume can be determined using the indicator method.
- Albumin constitutes 60% of the largest fraction of proteins in blood plasma and is therefore mainly responsible (for more than 80%) for maintaining colloid osmotic pressure.
Which plasma protein makes the largest contribution to the maintenance of colloid osmotic pressure?
- Albumin constitutes 60% of the largest fraction of proteins in blood plasma and is therefore mainly responsible (for more than 80%) for maintaining colloid osmotic pressure.
Which plasma protein fractions of serum electrophoresis do HDL and LDL lipoproteins belong to, respectively?
- HDL is also called α1-lipoprotein and therefore runs in the α-globulin fraction in serum electrophoresis. LDL is also referred to as β-lipoprotein and belongs to the β-globulin fraction.
What are the cation and anion with the highest concentration in plasma?
- Among the cations, sodium (Na+), and among the anions chloride (Cl−) have the highest concentration in plasma.
### Blood Cells

Which antigen on the erythrocyte surface defines a person's Rh status? What genotype is present in Rh-negative individuals?
- Whether a person's blood group is called Rhesus-positive or Rhesus-negative depends on the presence of the D antigen on the erythrocyte surface. This is inherited dominantly, so only the absence of the D gene on both alleles (genotype dd) leads to the blood group characteristic Rhesus-negative.
Is it possible for two Rh-positive parents to have an Rh-negative child?
- The gene responsible for the formation of the Rhesus factor (D gene) is inherited autosomal-dominantly. Even in heterozygosity (dD or Dd), a Rhesus-positive phenotype is present. According to Mendel's law of segregation, there is therefore a 25% chance that two heterozygous parents will have a Rhesus-negative child (dd).
Is it possible for two Rh-negative parents to have an Rh-positive child?
- The gene responsible for the formation of the Rhesus factor (D gene) is inherited autosomal-dominantly. This means that the characteristic Rhesus-negative can only arise from the absence of the D gene on both alleles (genotype dd). A child of two Rhesus-negative parents can consequently not inherit a D gene and thus cannot form a Rhesus factor. It is in every case Rhesus-negative.
How can Rh incompatibility cause hemolytic anemia in newborns?
- Rh incompatibility occurs when a Rhesus-negative woman is pregnant with a Rhesus-positive child for the second time. If the mother's blood comes into contact with the blood of her Rhesus-positive child during the first birth, placenta-crossing anti-Rhesus antibodies (anti-D antibodies) are produced. In a subsequent pregnancy with a Rhesus-positive child, these antibodies can cross the placental barrier and lead to the destruction (hemolysis) of fetal erythrocytes.
What do the A, B, and O genes of the ABO blood group system code for?
- The A and B genes of the ABO system code for different glycosyltransferases which are located on the erythrocyte membrane and modify carbohydrate-containing surface antigens differently depending on the blood group. The O gene is a so-called "silent gene," i.e., it produces no glycosyltransferase and no other gene product.
What is the so-called H-substance?
- The H-substance refers to the surface antigen which forms the common basis of all blood groups in the ABO system, thus it is also found on erythrocytes of individuals with blood group O. The H-substance is composed of N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and fucose. In carriers of blood groups A, B, and AB, further carbohydrate sections are added by glycosyltransferases.
Which allele combination leads to the expression of blood type O?
- The alleles A and B are codominant over 0. This means that only inheritance of the "0" trait from both parents leads to the expression of blood group O (allele combination 00).
In which case do Anti-B and Anti-A antibodies form in the blood?
- The body automatically forms antibodies against the erythrocyte antigens of the ABO system that are missing in the first months of life. Accordingly, persons with blood group A always have antibodies against the B antigen, persons with blood group B have anti-A antibodies. The erythrocytes of blood group O carry no surface antigens, so both anti-A and anti-B antibodies are formed, whereas persons with blood group AB do not form antibodies.
If you mix the blood serum of one person with the red blood cells of another person, agglutination may occur. When does this happen?
- Agglutination, i.e., clumping of blood, occurs when an antigen on the erythrocyte surface meets its corresponding antibody. This is the case, for example, when the serum of a person with blood group O is mixed with the erythrocytes of a person with blood group B. The serum contains anti-A and anti-B antibodies; the latter reacts with the surface antigen B of the second person and the blood agglutinates.
To which immunoglobulin class do the antibodies of the ABO system and the Rh system belong?
- The antibodies of the ABO system (anti-A and anti-B antibodies) mostly belong to the class of IgM antibodies, whereas the anti-D antibodies of the Rhesus system are placenta-crossing IgG.
