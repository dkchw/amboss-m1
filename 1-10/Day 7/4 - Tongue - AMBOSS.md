# Tongue
## Summary

The tongue (Lingua) has various functions for humans, which are expressed in its special structure: The largest part of the tongue consists of the outer and inner tongue muscles, which support speaking as well as the processes of chewing and swallowing. The tongue is covered by specialized mucous membrane with different tongue papillae, which serve the perception of taste and the reception of mechanical stimuli. The so-called lingual tonsils (Tonsilla lingualis) are located on the back of the tongue and serve as a barrier against pathogens that enter through the mouth opening.

In the innervation of the tongue, a distinction is made between the front two-thirds and the back third: The front section is innervated sensibly by a branch of the mandibular nerve and sensorily by the chorda tympani of the facial nerve; the back third is supplied both sensibly and sensorily by the glossopharyngeal nerve. The motor innervation of the entire tongue musculature is provided by the hypoglossal nerve.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

The tongue lies in the oral cavity and can be divided into three areas: tip of the tongue, body of the tongue, and base of the tongue. The tongue is supplied by branches of the A. lingualis, and the venous drainage occurs through the V. lingualis. The innervation of the tongue is relatively complex, as it occurs differently in the anterior two-thirds than in the posterior third.

### Profile

- Function
    - Grinding and forwarding of food
    - Taste
    - Speaking (see Larynx, Speaking and Language)
- Location: In the oral cavity (Cavitas oris propria)

### Structure

Different areas are distinguished on the tongue:

- Tip of the tongue (Apex linguae)
- Body of the tongue (Corpus linguae)
    - Tongue dorsum (Dorsum linguae)
        - The median sulcus of the tongue runs along the dorsum of the tongue.
            - Under the median sulcus of the tongue runs the aponeurosis of the tongue (connective tissue plate)
    - Underside of the tongue (Facies inferior linguae)
        - Lingual frenulum (Frenulum linguae)
- Tongue base/root (Radix linguae): Back third of the tongue
    - The V-shaped sulcus terminalis linguae separates the anterior two-thirds of the tongue from the tongue's base.
    - Extends to the epiglottic vallecula
    - Contains lymphatic tissue (lingual tonsil)

### Topography

The tongue lies in the oral cavity and is adjacent to various structures there:

- Lateral and ventral: Teeth
- Cranial: Palate
- Kaudal: Riverbed
- Dorsal: Oral part of the pharynx

## Tongue Musculature

The tongue has a large number of muscles, which are divided into external (originating from the skull) and internal (located within the tongue) muscles. All tongue muscles are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve.

- External tongue muscles: Originate from the skull bone
    - M. genioglossus
    - M. hyoglossus
    - M. styloglossus
- Intrinsic tongue muscles: Run only within the tongue
    - Mm. longitudinal superior and inferior
    - Transverse muscle of the tongue
    - M. verticalis of the tongue

## Microscopic Anatomy

The surface of the tongue consists of multilayered non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which is movable on the underside of the tongue and immovable on the surface. Additionally, there are four different types of papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue.

- Mucosa
    - Ventral surface: Moveable, multilayered non-keratinized squamous epithelium
    - Dorsum of the tongue: Non-movable, multi-layered non-keratinized squamous epithelium
        - Dorsal of the terminal sulcus: Lingual tonsil (lingual pads)
        - Before the terminal sulcus: papillae for tasting and feeling the food
            - Fungiform papillae: Taste
            - Foliate papillae: Taste
            - Vallate papillae (Wallpapillen): Taste
            - Filiform papillae: Taste
- Glands of the tongue: Lingual glands
- Tongue muscles

## Function

The tongue plays an important role for humans, both motorically and sensorily. Additionally, the tongue cushions ensure that pathogens entering through the mouth are repelled.

- Motor functions
    - Grasping, grinding, and forwarding of food
    - Speaking (see Larynx, Speaking and Language)
- Sensory Function
    - Taste
- Defense against pathogens through lymphatic tissue

## Development

For the development of the tongue, parts of the first four gill arches play a role.

- Development of the tongue body
    1. Proliferation of mesoderm cells from the 1st pharyngeal arch
    2. Three bulges are formed
        - A median prominence (Tuberculum impar)
        - Two lateral ridges (lateral lingual tubercles)
    3. The lateral ridges grow larger, extend beyond the middle ridge, and merge with each other at the median sulcus of the tongue.
    4. The epithelial cells originate from the ectoderm of the primitive oral cavity.
- Development of the base of the tongue
    1. Proliferation of mesoderm cells of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th branchial arches
    2. Two humps are formed.
        - The copula (from the 2nd arch)
        - Hypobranchial body (from the 3rd and 4th arch)
    3. The hypobranchial body overgrows the copula and forms the largest part of the tongue base.
    4. The epithelial cells arise from the endoderm.
- Development of the tongue muscles: Myoblasts from the occipital somites
