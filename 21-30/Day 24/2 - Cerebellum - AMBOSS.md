# Cerebellum
## Summary

The cerebellum is one of the oldest structures of the brain in terms of evolutionary history. It is located in the posterior cranial fossa and plays a central role in the coordination of movement sequences alongside balance control. Due to its different functions, the cerebellum is divided into several areas: the vestibular, spinal, and pontocerebellum. In addition, there is an anatomical division into the two cerebellar hemispheres and the cerebellar vermis.

The cerebellum is connected to the brainstem via three cerebellar peduncles. Afferent and efferent pathways run through these, connecting the cerebellum with other cerebral structures. Just like the cerebrum, the interior of the cerebellum can also be divided into the cerebellar white matter (with the cerebellar nuclei) and the cerebellar cortex.

In the cerebellar cortex, the processing of information takes place. Subsequently, the integrated information is gathered in the cerebellar nuclei, which represent the output of the cerebellum for the control of the efferents.

### Structure

#### Anatomical Classification of the Cerebellum

- The cerebellum can be divided into two cerebellar hemispheres and the cerebellar vermis.
    - Cerebellar hemispheres (= Hemispheria cerebelli)
        - Cerebellar tonsils (= Tonsillae cerebelli): Caudal section of the cerebellar hemisphere
    - Cerebellar vermis (= Vermis cerebelli): Located centrally between the hemispheres
- When looking at the cerebellum from rostral to caudal, the hemispheres and vermis can be divided into three lobes, which are separated from each other by two fissures.
    - Cloth
        - Anterior cerebellar lobe
            - Lingula cerebelli: A part of the anterior cerebellar lobe located at the cranial and median end of the vermis, which lies over the superior medullary velum
        - Posterior cerebellar lobe
        - Flocculonodular lobe: Consists of the Nodulus vermis and the two Flocculi
            - Nodulus vermis: Caudal section of the vermis of the cerebellum, which is only visible from the ventral side.
            - Flocculus: Portions of the hemispheres that lie laterally on both sides of the nodulus.
    - Cracks
        - Primary fissure: Divides the hemispheres into the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and the posterior lobe of the cerebellum.
        - Posterolateral fissure: Separates the flocculonodular lobe from the posterior cerebellar lobe.
- Is connected to the brainstem via three cerebellar peduncles
    - Superior cerebellar peduncle (= Superior cerebellar peduncle)
    - Middle cerebellar peduncle (= Pedunculus cerebellaris medius)
    - Inferior cerebellar peduncle (= Inferior cerebellar peduncle)

> [!NOTE] Lower Clamping  
> With increased intracranial pressure, a so-called lower herniation can occur. In this case, the cerebellar tonsils are trapped between the medulla oblongata and the foramen magnum, whereby vital structures in the medulla oblongata (e.g., the respiratory center) may be compressed.

#### Vascular Supply

In the cerebellum, the arterial and venous vessels run separately from each other. The arterial vessels anastomose with one another, ensuring that the supply to the cerebellum remains secure even if one vessel is occluded.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- P. inferior posterior cerebelli (PICA) from P. vertebralis<br>- P. inferior anterior cerebelli (AICA) from P. basilaris<br>- P. superior cerebelli (SCA) from P. basilaris|
|Venous|- Division into two groups<br>    - Medial group of veins in transverse sinus<br>    - Lateral group of veins in superior petrosal sinus and transverse sinus|

#### Topography

- Location: Located in the posterior cranial fossa (= Fossa cranii posterior)
- Limitations
    - Ventral: Medulla oblongata, Pons, and IV. Ventricle
    - Cranial: Is covered by the tentorium cerebelli
    - Caudal: Foramen magnum
## Microscopic Anatomy of the Cerebellum

The cerebellum serves the coordination and fine-tuning of movement sequences. For this purpose, it receives movement information from different areas of the CNS, which are processed in the cerebellar cortex. The integrated information is collected in the cerebellar nuclei and then forwarded via the efferents of the cerebellum.

- The interior of the cerebellum can be divided into
    - Cerebellar cortex (Cortex cerebelli)
    - Cerebellar white matter (Corpus medullare cerebelli) with the cerebellar nuclei (Nuclei cerebelli)
## Cerebellar Cortex

### Layers of the Cerebellar Cortex

The cerebellar cortex has a three-layered structure (from outside to inside).

| |Characteristics|Specific Content|
|---|---|---|
|Stratum moleculare (=Molecular layer)|- Rich in fibers|- Parallel fibers: Axon from Granule cells<br>- Dendritic tree of Purkinje cells<br>- Climbing fibers: Axon from the lower Olive<br>- Inhibitory Interneurons (Basket and Stellate cells)|
|Stratum ganglionare (=Purkinje cell layer)|- Rich in nerve cells|- Perikarya of the Purkinje cells<br>- Bergmann glia: Glial cells of the cerebellum|
|Stratum granulosum (cerebellum) (=granule layer of the cerebellum)|- Very rich in nerve cells|- Many granule cells, which are closely packed together<br>- Few Golgi cells|

### Cell types of the cerebellar cortex

In the cerebellar cortex, various types of nerve cells communicate with each other. Among these types of nerve cells, the Purkinje cells form the central connection point. The other cell types are each interconnected with the Purkinje cells in different ways and predominantly exert an inhibitory effect there.

|Neuron Type|Cell Name|Effect|Characteristics|
|---|---|---|---|
|Projection Neurons|- Purkinje Cells|- Inhibitory (GABA)|- Large Dendritic Tree<br>    - Highly branched: Many Synapses with other cells<br>    - All dendritic branches are in a single plane<br>- Axons<br>    - Extend to the Cerebellar Nuclei, occasionally also directly to the Vestibular Nuclei<br>    - Provide collaterals to Golgi and Basket Cells<br>- Special Feature<br>    - The only efferent Nerve Fiber of the Cerebellar Cortex<br>    - Central integration point of the Cerebellar Cortex|
|Interneuron|- Cerebellar star cells|- Surround inhibition<br>    - Principle<br>        - The inhibitory interneurons mainly inhibit the only weakly excited Purkinje cells<br>        - This increases the contrast between excited and non-excited Purkinje cells<br>    - Result: Serve to enhance spatial contrast|
|- Carbon cells|
|- Golgi cells|- Inhibit primarily granule cells|
|- Granule Cells|- Excitatory (Glutamate)|- The only excitatory cell of the Cerebellar Cortex<br>- Perikarya: Very small and densely packed in the Granular Layer of the Cerebellum<br>- Axon: Form the parallel fibers<br>- Are connected in a special way with the Golgi Cells: On one hand, efferent (Granule Cell excites Golgi Cell), on the other hand, also afferent (Golgi Cell inhibits Granule Cell) → Negative feedback loop that leads to temporal contrast enhancement|
|Glial cells|- Bergmann glial cells|- Function so far unknown|- Special type of astroglia|

> [!NOTE]
> The granule cells are the only excitatory cells within the cerebellar cortex!

> [!NOTE]
> The axons of the Purkinje cells have an inhibitory effect and are the only efferent fibers to leave the cerebellar cortex!

### Types of Layers in the Cerebellar Cortex

#### Afferent Connections

The cerebellar cortex has two input systems: the climbing fiber system and the mossy fiber system. Both systems are excitatory and primarily use glutamate as a neurotransmitter. After processing the information, it leaves the cortex via the fibers of the Purkinje cells and thus reaches the cerebellar nuclei.

- Two afferent fiber systems
    - Climbing fibers
        - Origin: Contralateral inferior olivary nuclei
        - Direct connection
            - Climbing fibers end directly at the dendritic tree of Purkinje cells and excite them.
            - Here, a climbing fiber is connected to each Purkinje cell
            - Climbing fibers also give off excitatory collaterals to the cerebellar nuclei
    - Moss fibers
        - Origin:
            - Vestibular nuclei and vestibular ganglion
            - Spinal Cord
            - Bridge cores (Motor skills)
            - Reticular formation
        - Indirect wiring with the Purkinje cells
            - Moss fibers are synaptically connected in the stratum granulosum with the keratinocytes synaptically.
            - The granule cells send their axons as parallel fibers to the Purkinje cells and excite them.
        - Direct connection with cerebellar nuclei
            - Moss fibers form direct collaterals with the cerebellar nuclei

> [!NOTE]
> The climbing fibers originate in the lower olive complex and are synaptically connected to the dendritic tree of the Purkinje cells!

> [!NOTE]
> For the assignment of climbing fibers to their place of origin, it can help: You can climb on the olive tree.

#### Efferent Connections

The cerebellar cortex has only one output system: The Purkinje cells, which inhibit the downstream cerebellar nuclei as well as the vestibular nuclei. The cerebellar nuclei then project to the motor cortex and to motor centers in the brainstem.

- Purkinje Cells
    - Circuitry to the cerebellar nuclei
        - Purkinje cells predominantly project to the cerebellar nuclei
            - Ncl. dentatus
            - Ncl. interpositus
            - Ncl. fastigii
        - The information is relayed from the cerebellar nuclei
            - About excitatory neurons to
                - Thalamus and from there to the motor cortex
                - Ncl. ruber
                - Vestibular nuclei and from there to the ventromedial pathway
                - Reticular formation
                - Mesencephalon and Diencephalon
                - Spinal Cord
            - About inhibitory neurons to
                - Lower olive nuclei
    - Without interconnection
        - Individual Purkinje cells leave the cerebellum and project directly to the cerebellar nuclei without synapsing to the vestibular nuclei in the pons and medulla oblongata.

#### Interconnection between cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei

The cerebellum has numerous regulatory circuits with feedback mechanisms. For example, the cerebellar cortex forms an inhibitory loop that modulates the efferents of the cerebellar nuclei.

Information flow and interconnection principle between cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei

1. Movement information reaches the cerebellar cortex via afferent excitatory pathways (mossy and climbing fibers).
2. The afferent pathways each send collaterals to the cerebellar nuclei
3. The cerebellar cortex modulates via the inhibitory loop (Purkinje cells) the cerebellar nuclei
4. The cerebellar nuclei transmit the integrated information via excitatory fibers to various brainstem areas (including the vestibular nuclei, reticular formation, red nucleus, thalamus) and then onward to the cerebral cortex as well as the spinal cord.
5. Similarly, the cerebellar nuclei inhibit the Ncl. olivaris inferior (from which the climbing fibers originate).
## Cerebellar Nuclei

The cerebellar nuclei are located in the cerebellar white matter and are embedded in the white matter. Here, a large portion of the fibers of the Purkinje cells ends. The axons of the cerebellar nuclei serve as the "output" from the cerebellum; aside from some direct fiber connections, all efferents of the cerebellum originate from the nuclei. They thus form the central relay point of the cerebellum. Depending on which part of the cerebellum the nuclei communicate with, different functions can be assigned to them.

- Dentate nucleus (= Zahnkern)
    - Form: Folded sheet
    - Circuitry: Axons of the Purkinje cells from the cerebellar hemispheres end here.
    - Functional classification: Integrates motor actions
- Interposed nucleus
    - Consists of two cores
        - Nucleus globosus (= Globular nucleus)
        - Nucleus emboliformis (= Graft nucleus)
    - Wiring: Axons of the Purkinje cells from the so-called paravermal zone end here.
    - Functional classification: Balance and support motor skills, goal-oriented motor skills
- Nucleus fastigii (= First or Giebelkern)
    - Shape: Egg-shaped
    - Circuitry: Axons of the Purkinje cells from the cerebellar vermis end here
    - Functional classification: Balance and support motor skills
## Function of the Cerebellum

The cerebellum is the regulatory organ for motor skills. Functionally, it can be divided into three parts: the vestibulocerebellum, the spinocerebellum, and the pontocerebellum. Furthermore, the cerebellum can be developmentally classified into the archicerebellum, paleocerebellum, and the neocerebellum, although this classification only partially aligns with the functional classification.

## Cerebellar Peduncles

The afferent and efferent fiber connections of the cerebellum run through three paired cerebellar peduncles and connect the ventral side of the cerebellum with the brainstem. They transmit information to and from the cerebellar sections and are therefore closely linked to their function.

### Superior Cerebellar Peduncle

Most cerebellar efferents run through the superior cerebellar peduncle. These include the cerebellothalamic tract as well as the cerebellorubral tract. The anterior spinocerebellar tract transmits proprioceptive afferents to the cerebellar vermis.

| |Phase track|Origin|Destination|Function|Special feature|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Afferents|- Anterior spinocerebellar tract (=cerebellar lateral pathway)|- Dorsal horn of the spinal cord|- Ipsilateral cerebellar vermis|- Processing of proprioceptive afferents|- This fiber tract is somatotopically organized|
|Efferents|- Cerebellothalamic tract|- Predominantly Ncl. dentatus|- Contralateral Thalamus (Ncl. ventralis lateralis)|- Influence on voluntary motor control|- This is the largest efferent of the cerebellum|
|- Cerebellorubral tract|- Emboliform nucleus<br>- Globose nucleus|- Contralateral red nucleus (Magnocellular part)|- Influence on extrapyramidal motor control|- The rubrospinal tract originates from the magnocellular part of the red nucleus|
|- Ncl. dentatus|- Contralateral Ncl. ruber (Pars parvocellularis)|- These fibers are part of an impulse-modulating control circuit<br>    - Ncl. ruber and Ncl. dentatus → Lower Olive → Cerebellar cortex → Cerebellar nuclei (including Ncl. dentatus) → Lower Olive, Ncl. ruber and Thalamus|

### Middle Cerebellar Peduncle

The middle cerebellar peduncle contains only afferent fibers. These originate from the pons, cross here, and terminate as moss fibers in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere.

| |Phase track|Origin|Destination|Functional assignment|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Afferents|- Pontocerebellar fibers|- Pontine nuclei in the pons<br>- These pontine nuclei have two different afferents<br>    - Temporopontine fibers (Türck bundle)<br>    - Frontopontine fibers (Arnold bundle)|- Predominantly contralateral cerebellar hemisphere cortex (as mossy fibers)<br>- Individual fibers also extend to the dentate nucleus and to the emboliform nucleus|- Fibers transmit movement drafts from the cortex to the cerebellum|

> [!NOTE]
> The pontocerebellar fibers are a continuation of the corticopontine pathway!

### Lower Cerebellar Peduncle

Im lower cerebellar peduncle run the most important cerebellar afferents. Through this, a connection is established between the cerebellum, the vestibular nuclei, the lower olive, and the spinal cord.

| |Phase track|Origin|Destination|Functional allocation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Afferents|- Tract vestibulocerebellaris|- Vestibular nuclei|- Flocculonodular lobe|- Transmits spatial information from the vestibular apparatus to the cerebellum|
|- Olivocerebellar tract|- Lower Olive (Ncl. olivaris inferior)|- Cerebellar hemispheres and Vermis (form the climbing fibers)|- Feedback loop between the cerebellum and Ncl. ruber (see Cerebellorubral tract)|
|- Posterior spinocerebellar tract (=cerebellar lateral column)|- Dorsal horn of the spinal cord|- Cerebellar vermis and paravermal zone (form the mossy fibers)|- Transmit proprioceptive information from the lower extremities and the trunk to the cerebellum|
|Efferents|- Cerebellovestibular tract|- Ncl. fastigii<br>- Additionally, direct fiber connections from the vestibulocerebellar cortex|- Vestibular nuclei|- Coordination of<br>    - Postural motor skills<br>    - Eye movements|
|- Cerebelloolivary tract |- Dentate nucleus |- Lower Olive (Inferior olivary nucleus) |- Feedback loop between the cerebellum and Red nucleus (see Cerebellorubral tract) |

## Review Questions on the Chapter Cerebellum
### Microscopic Anatomy of the Cerebellum

The cerebellar cortex is divided into which layers and what characteristic features do these layers have?  
- The cerebellar cortex has a three-layered structure. On the outside lies the stratum moleculare (= molecular layer), beneath that the stratum ganglionare (= Purkinje cell layer), and innermost the stratum granulosum (cerebellum), also called the granular layer of the cerebellum. The stratum moleculare contains the axons of granule cells and is therefore very fiber-rich. The stratum ganglionare contains the perikarya of the Purkinje cells. The innermost stratum granulosum (cerebellum) is very rich in nerve cells and contains many densely packed granule cells as well as few Golgi cells.  
Which cells are referred to as projection neurons of the cerebellum and what effect do they have?  
- The so-called "projection neurons" are the only neurons whose axons leave the cerebellum and correspond to Purkinje cells. They transmit their efferent signals mainly to the cerebellar nuclei, and occasionally directly to the vestibular nuclei. Via the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, they exert an inhibitory effect.  
What is the special feature of the so-called "grain cell"?  
- Granule cells belong to the interneurons and act excitatory via glutamate, being the only excitatory cells of the cerebellar cortex.  
What task does the so-called "Golgi cell" fulfill?  
- Golgi cells are connected to granule cells in a special manner: the granule cell excites the Golgi cell, but conversely, the Golgi cell inhibits the granule cell.  
Name the two afferent fiber systems of the cerebellum! Which neurotransmitter do they use?  
- The cerebellum receives excitatory signals from the mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Both primarily use glutamate as their transmitter.  
What are the origins and goals of the two afferent fiber systems of the cerebellar cortex?  
- The climbing fibers (= direct connection) originate from the contralateral inferior olivary nuclei and end directly on the dendritic tree of the Purkinje cells, exciting them. The mossy fibers (= indirect connection) refer to all other afferents of the cerebellum that are not climbing fibers. They form synapses in the stratum granulosum with the granule cells. These in turn send their axons as parallel fibers to the Purkinje cells and excite them.  
Describe the function, shape, and location of the dentate nucleus!  
- The paired dentate nucleus belongs to the cerebellar nuclei and is especially responsible for the integration of motor functions. It is embedded in the white matter of the cerebellar medulla in the form of a folded leaf.

### Function of the Cerebellum

What clinical symptoms result from a dysfunction of the cerebellum?  
- Classic symptoms of cerebellar damage include cerebellar ataxia (= uncoordinated execution of movements), nystagmus (= gaze stabilization disorder), intention tremor (= rhythmic movements of one or more body parts that intensify when approaching a target), and dysdiadochokinesia, i.e., the loss of ability to perform antagonistic movements (e.g., pronation/supination).

### Cerebellar Peduncles

Which fiber connections of the cerebellum run in the middle cerebellar peduncle?  
- The middle cerebellar peduncle contains only afferent fibers from the pons, the so-called "fibrae pontocerebellares". They cross over in the middle cerebellar peduncle and thus end as mossy fibers in the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere.  
Where do the afferents of the so-called “vestibulocerebellar tract” end and what information does it convey?  
- The vestibulocerebellar tract runs together with the other main cerebellar afferents in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. It ends in the lobus flocculonodularis to relay positional information from the vestibular apparatus to the cerebellum.
