# Gallbladder and Bile
## Summary

The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ located dorsal to the liver. It stores the bile produced by the liver, further concentrates it, and releases it as needed into the duodenum via the common bile duct. The bile is a slightly alkaline, viscous secretion primarily composed of water, bile acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Its main function is to neutralize the acidic chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach and is also essential for fat digestion: The amphiphilic bile acids form micelles in the intestinal lumen with monoacylglycerols, free fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol and thus transport these to the enterocytes. Only in this form can nonpolar substances be absorbed. The bile acids themselves are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum as part of the enterohepatic circulation and return to the liver.

The composition of the bile has particular clinical relevance: If the insoluble components (e.g., cholesterol) predominate, they can precipitate as so-called gallstones. The resulting clinical picture (cholecystolithiasis) can be accompanied by an inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which leads to the necessity of surgical removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). It is the most common surgery in visceral surgery.
## Gallbladder

The gallbladder is an intraperitoneal organ that can store bile produced in the liver and release it when needed.

### Profile and macroscopic anatomy of the gallbladder

- Function: storage, concentration, and release of the bile
- Location: Intraperitoneal
- Shape: Pear-shaped
- Volume: Approx. 70 mL
- Outline: Neck (Collum), Body (Corpus) and Base (Fundus)

### Topography

- Location: In the fossa of the gallbladder on the visceral surface of the liver
- Location relationships
    - Kollum: Located ventrally to the superior part of the duodenum
    - Corpus: Is in contact with the flexure of the colon on the right side.
    - Fundus: Right of the falciform ligament of the liver at the level of the 9th rib below the lower edge of the liver

### Blood Supply and Innervation of the Gallbladder

- Blood supply
    - A. cystica: Arises from the A. hepatica dextra
    - Vv. cysticae: Münden in the Lig. hepatoduodenale into the V. portae
- Innervation
    - Sympathetic, parasympathetic and sensory innervation (pain fibers) from the hepatic plexus
    - Additional pain fibers run out of the phrenic nerve on the right from the cervical plexus

> [!NOTE]
> The innervation by the phrenic nerve results in pain from the gallbladder being referred to the right shoulder (see "referred pain" dermatome, Dermatome C4)!

  

> [!NOTE] Cholecystitis
> A gallstone disease (cholecystolithiasis) can lead to inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). A cholecystitis is characterized not only by fever but also by pain in the upper right abdomen, which can radiate to the right shoulder. Detection is usually achieved through sonography, which can depict the inflamed thickened gallbladder wall as well as the usually causative gallstones.

  

> [!NOTE] Cholecystectomy
> Since the gallbladder is not a vital organ, it can be removed in cases of severe or recurrent gallstone disease.



> [!NOTE] Murphy's sign and Courvoisier's sign
> Due to its location, the gallbladder, like the liver edge, is palpable during the clinical examination under the right costal margin. However, it only stands out from the liver edge when it is enlarged due to pathological processes. In cases of inflammation, palpation is painful (Murphy's sign), while a tumor of the gallbladder appears firm-elastic but painless (Courvoisier's sign).

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Gallbladder

- The wall of the gallbladder is lined with mucosa, which forms high folds and crypts (so-called Rokitansky-Aschoff crypts) depending on the state of distension.
- Wall construction
    - Mucous membrane (“mucosa”): Single-layered cylindrical epithelium with microvilli, lamina propria
    - Tunica muscularis ("Muscularis"): Arranged in a scissor-like pattern smooth muscle
    - Subserosal layer ("Subserosa"): Connective tissue layer that lies between the serosa and the tunica muscularis, allowing them to slide against each other.
    - Serous tunic ("Serosa"): On the side facing the abdominal cavity
    - Tunica adventitia ("Adventitia"): Covers the side of the gallbladder facing the liver

## Bile Ducts

The bile ducts are the canalicular system that transports the bile produced by the hepatocytes from the liver to the duodenum. There is a distinction between intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.

### Intrahepatic Bile Ducts

- Definition: Biliary tract within the liver to the porta hepatis
- Path of the Bile
    1. Bile canaliculi
    2. Hering channels: Short connecting pieces at the periportal border zone of the liver lobule
    3. Interlobular bile ducts: Bile ducts of the Glisson's triad, which run between the lobules and are lined with a simple, isoprismatic epithelium
    4. Right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct

### Extrahepatic Bile Ducts

- Definition: Bile ducts from the hepatic portal to the duodenum
- Components
    - Common hepatic duct: Formed by the union of the right hepatic duct and left hepatic duct and leaves the liver through the porta hepatis, then divides into cystic duct and common bile duct
        - Cystic duct: Branches off from the common hepatic duct and directs the bile into the gallbladder
            - Heister's valve: Spiral-shaped closure fold in the cystic duct
        - Common bile duct: Continuation of the common hepatic duct after the departure of the cystic duct
            - Pulls in the hepatoduodenal ligament to the duodenum
            - It enters the pancreatic head and unites with the pancreatic duct, before opening into the duodenum.
            - Is lined with a single-layer, prismatic epithelium and contains mucous glands
            - Opening: Major duodenal papilla (Papilla Vateri): Small elevation with a sphincter (M. sphincter Oddi) in the descending part of the duodenum
                - M. sphincter Oddi: A circular muscle that regulates the flow of bile from the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct into the duodenum through its contraction state.
- Calot's Triangle: Anatomical space formed by the common hepatic duct, cystic duct and liver margin, which houses the cystic artery.

> [!NOTE]
> The bile first flows through the hepatic duct and the cystic duct into the gallbladder, where it is stored and concentrated. When the digestive process begins, the gallbladder contracts, and the bile can flow into the duodenum through the common bile duct!

> [!NOTE] Choledocholithiasis  
> Gallstones can also occur in the bile ducts (or travel from the gallbladder to there). Unlike the presence of stones in the gallbladder (referred to as cholecystolithiasis), this condition is termed choledocholithiasis. Impaired drainage of the bile leads to a backlog. As a result, many substances can no longer be excreted. Laboratory tests show an increase in the so-called cholestasis parameters (alkaline phosphatase, γGT, and direct bilirubin), clinically, there may be a yellowing of the skin due to bilirubin deposits (known as jaundice).

> [!NOTE] Biliary Pancreatitis
> In the context of biliary tract diseases (such as choledocholithiasis or bile duct stenoses), bile stasis often occurs, even within the pancreas. The bile acids contained in the bile can damage the pancreatic epithelium. Additionally, there may be a release and activation of pancreatic enzymes, leading to "autodigestion," or the breakdown of pancreatic tissue. One consequence is acute pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), which is then referred to as biliary pancreatitis. Biliary pancreatitis is the most common form of pancreatitis (45%).

## The Gallbladder

Bile is a viscous, slightly alkaline bodily fluid of yellow-green color, produced in the liver, and plays an important role in fat digestion and the excretion of poorly soluble substances.

### Function, Formation, and Transport of Bile

- Function of the bile
    - Neutralization of the strongly acidic digestive chyme that enters the stomach into the duodenum
    - Fat digestion: The bile acids contained in the bile form micelles with non-water-soluble fat components such as triglycerides, fatty acids, and steroids, thus making them soluble and absorbable in the digestive tract.
    - Excretion of non-water-soluble products such as cholesterol, bilirubin and many medications as well as their metabolites
- Formation of bile: Occurs in the hepatocytes
    - Quantity: Approx. 700 mL/day
    - Composition
        - Water (approx. 80%)
        - Bile acids (about 10–15%)
        - Lecithin and other phospholipids (approx. 5%)
        - Cholesterol (approx. 1%)
        - Breakdown products of the liver (especially bilirubin) (approx. 1%)
- Storage and secretion of the bile
    - Hepatocytes secrete bile directly into the apically located bile canaliculi
    - Modification of the gallbladder by cholangiocyte cells, among others, through
        - Secretion of osmotically active substances (e.g. bicarbonate via Cl-/HCO3--antiporter)
        - Passive inflow of water into the gallbladder
    - Transport occurs via the intrahepatic and part of the extrahepatic bile ducts to the gallbladder
    - Gallbladder: Storing and concentrating the bile → By the removal of water and NaCl, the bile is reduced here to about 10% of its volume.
    - Release stimuli: Cholecystokinin (CCK) and an increased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system lead to contraction of the gallbladder with emptying of the bile into the common bile duct
    - Transport: Through the common bile duct to the duodenum

### Bile Acids and Bile Acid Synthesis

Bile acids are an important component of bile and serve the purpose of fat digestion and absorption. Due to their amphiphilic properties, they form mixed micelles: in the bile ducts, among others, with hydrophobic cholesterol, in the intestinal lumen with hydrophobic food components such as monoacylglycerols, free fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and cholesterol (and transport these to the enterocytes).

- Primary bile acids (e.g., cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid): They are synthesized in the hepatocytes from cholesterol, thereby acquiring their lipophilic properties, and subsequently conjugated with taurine (a derivative of cysteine) and glycine, which give them hydrophilic properties.
    1. Basic structure of bile acids: Steroid framework, where the rings A and B are cis-connected and at the C3-atom there is a hydroxyl group.
    2. Synthesis of Cholic Acid from Cholesterol
        1. Hydroxylation of cholesterol at position 7α by the cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (rate-limiting step) in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum
        2. Hydroxylation at position 12α
        3. Isomerization and oxidation to trihydroxycoprostanate
        4. By shortening the side chain (analogous to β-oxidation), cholic acid is formed.
        5. Activation of cholic acid to cholyl-CoA (with ATP consumption)
        6. Hepatic conjugation with taurine (taurocholic acid) or glycine (glycocholic acid)
    3. Release of taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid into the bile canaliculi
- Secondary bile acids: Are formed in the intestine by the enzymes of anaerobic bacteria from primary bile acids
    - Process
        - Separation of taurine and glycine
        - Cleavage of a hydroxyl group
    - Examples: Deoxycholic acid, Lithocholic acid
- Enterohepatic circulation
    - Bile acids are not completely excreted with the feces, but are mostly reabsorbed in the terminal ileum through a Na+-symport secondary active transport and are returned to the liver via the portal vein.
    - In the liver, the absorbed bile acids enter through the sinusoids into the Disse space via a secondary active Na+-symport back into the hepatocytes

> [!NOTE]
> Both the primary and the secondary bile acids are almost completely reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and undergo the enterohepatic circulation!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Gallbladder and Bile
### Bile Ducts

Describe the path of the bile through the intrahepatic bile ducts!
- Bile is first secreted after its production in the hepatocyte into the canaliculi biliferi, which lie between two apical cell poles of the hepatocytes. From there, it passes into the Hering channels (short connecting pieces at the periportal edge zone of the liver lobule) and further into the interlobular bile ducts (bile ducts of the Glisson triad, which run between the lobules), until it finally drains into the right or left hepatic duct.

With which epithelium are the interlobular bile ducts lined?
- The interlobular bile ducts are lined with a simple, isoprismatic epithelium.

How is the emptying of the gallbladder prevented in cases of increased intra-abdominal pressure?
- It is assumed that the so-called Heister valve – a spirally folded flap in the cystic duct – prevents the emptying of the gallbladder during increased intra-abdominal pressure.

Why does an impaired drainage of the bile lead to a yellowing of the skin (jaundice)?
- Impaired bile drainage causes some substances, including bilirubin, to no longer be excreted. This then deposits in the skin and mucous membranes, which clinically manifests as yellow discoloration (jaundice).

Where does the common bile duct empty into the duodenum?
- The common bile duct unites with the pancreatic duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla and opens on the major duodenal papilla (Vater’s papilla) in the descending part of the duodenum.

### Bile

What role does bile play in fat digestion?
- The bile acids contained in bile form micelles with water-insoluble fat components such as triacylglycerides, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and steroids, thereby making them soluble and absorbable in the digestive tract.

What happens in the gallbladder with the bile?
- Through the removal of water and NaCl, bile is concentrated in the gallbladder and thus reduced to about 10% of its volume so that it can be more easily stored there.

Describe the principle of the synthesis of primary bile acids in general! Name at least one example of a primary bile acid!
- Primary bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes, whereby they acquire their lipophilic properties. Primary bile acids include cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, for example. Subsequently, they are conjugated with taurine (a derivative of cysteine) or glycine, which gives them hydrophilic properties. This results either in taurocholic acid or glycocholic acid.

Describe the basic structure of bile acids! What is the rate-limiting step of their synthesis and where does it occur?
- The basic structure of bile acids is a steroid skeleton whose A and B rings are cis-linked and which has a hydroxyl group at the C3 atom. The rate-limiting step of their synthesis is the hydroxylation of cholesterol at position 7α by cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase. This reaction takes place in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

What are secondary bile acids? Give an example!
- Secondary bile acids are formed in the intestine by the enzymes of anaerobic bacteria from primary bile acids. Typical secondary bile acids are deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid.

What happens to the bile acids in the intestine?
- Bile acids are almost completely reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and undergo enterohepatic circulation.

How do the bile acids return to the hepatocytes after absorption in the intestine?
- After absorption, the bile acids are transported back to the liver via the portal vein. They first reach the sinusoids and the space of Disse. From there they are transported back into the hepatocytes by a secondary active Na+ symport.

What is the function of cholecystokinin (CCK)?
- Cholecystokinin is secreted by the enteroendocrine I cells of the small intestine after contact with food components and especially stimulates the tunica muscularis of the gallbladder wall, causing the gallbladder to contract and increasing bile flow into the duodenum.
