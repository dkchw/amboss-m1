# General Hormonal Properties
## Summary

Hormones are involved in the regulation of a variety of processes in the body, such as metabolism, reproduction, or growth. Even very low hormone concentrations in the blood are sufficient to mediate effects at target organs that are reached via the bloodstream. This chapter aims to provide a rough overview of the different hormone groups and their metabolism.
## Principles of Extracellular Signal Transduction

Extracellular signal transmission occurs through the secretion of factors that bind to receptors on a target cell or possibly on the secreting cell itself. These factors can be hormones, cytokines, or neurotransmitters, for example. In this way, signals can be conveyed both between adjacent cells and between cells that are far apart in the body.

### Process of Extracellular Signal Transduction

The transmission of a signal from cell to cell through an extracellular signaling molecule occurs in several steps:

1. Signal generation: Secretion of the signaling molecule and transport to the target cell
2. Signal reception: Binding to the receptor
3. Signal cascade: Conversion of the extracellular signal into an intracellular signal, e.g. through second messengers.
4. Signal processing: Target effect, e.g., gene expression, activation of proteins, etc.

### Modes of Secretion

In the release of extracellular signaling molecules, three forms are distinguished.

## Classification of Hormones

To get an overview of the very heterogeneous group of hormones, let's look at the different classifications. To understand the storage, secretion, and molecular mechanisms of action of a hormone, knowledge about its properties, particularly its water solubility, is very helpful.

### Definition of Hormones

Hormones are chemical signaling substances of various substance classes that are produced in specialized cells or endocrine glands and transported via the blood to specific target cells. There, they regulate numerous metabolic and physiological parameters, such as blood sugar, osmolarity, or electrolyte balance.

### Classification by Place of Origin

Hormones can be roughly divided into glandular and aglandular hormones based on their place of origin, which are further classified according to their chemical structure. While cytokines, for example, are always small polypeptides, other hormones can be assigned to different substance classes. The most important substance classes will be discussed in more detail below. For the biochemistry of cytokines, see: Tissue hormones as inflammatory mediators and growth factors.

- Glandular Hormones: Formation in endocrine glands (Lat. "glandulae"), e.g. thyroid hormones, adrenal cortex hormones, etc.
- Aglandular hormones: produced in endocrine cells or clusters of cells that do not belong to a gland, e.g. hormones of the endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract (gastrin, serotonin, cholecystokinin) and the hypothalamic hormones (e.g. releasing and inhibiting hormones of the hypothalamus, ADH, oxytocin)

### Classification by Chemical Structure

The chemical structure is crucial for the biochemical properties of a hormone.

- Peptide/Protein Hormones: Derivatives of peptides and proteins, e.g. insulin, glucagon, prolactin
- Amino acid derivatives: Descendants of a single amino acid (without peptide bond), e.g. catecholamines, thyroxine
- Steroid hormones: Cholesterol derivatives, e.g. cortisol, aldosterone

### Classification by Biochemical Properties

The water solubility of a hormone or a hormone-like substance is crucial for its secretion into the blood, transport to the target organ, its mechanism of action, its half-life, and its degradation. One distinguishes:

- Hydrophilic Hormone: Peptide/Protein hormones and most amino acid derivatives (exception: thyroid hormones)
- Lipophile Hormone: Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones
    - Transport bound to plasma proteins due to lipophilicity → Solubility in blood↑ and half-life↑

### Mediators (Tissue Hormones)

The mediators are produced by cells in various tissues. Unlike most other hormones, they are not secreted endocrinically but rather paracrinally, thus primarily acting locally. For this reason, they occupy a special position among hormones. The group of mediators includes signaling substances of different substance classes:

- Biogenic Amines: For example, Histamine, Serotonin
- Eicosanoids (Arachidonic acid derivatives): e.g. Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Thromboxane A2
- Gases: For example, nitrogen monoxide (NO)
- Polypeptide: E.g. Cytokine
## Overview of Hormone Metabolism

Many characteristics of a hormone regarding its synthesis, storage, or secretion into the blood can be derived from its water or fat solubility. This depends on the chemical structure of the hormones, which is why the metabolism of the three major groups is listed below. Peptide hormones and amino acid derivatives are typically hydrophilic (exception: thyroid hormones!), while steroids, as cholesterol derivatives, are lipophilic. Hydrophilic hormones can be stored in vesicles for later use and released into the bloodstream when needed, where they have a significantly shorter half-life than steroid hormones, whereas steroid hormones are produced directly when needed.

### Synthesis, Storage, Secretion, Transport, and Mechanism of Action

- Peptide/Proteohormone
    - Procedure of synthesis
        - Synthesis at the rough endoplasmic reticulum
        - Modification in the Golgi apparatus
    - Storage: In secretory vesicles
    - Secretion: Extracellular stimulus → Fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane → Release into the blood
    - Transport in the blood: Free transport in the blood
    - Mode of action: Binding to membrane-bound receptors
    - Half-life: Few minutes to hours
- Amino acid derivatives
    - Synthesis: Biosynthesis in a few steps from an amino acid
    - Storage: In secretory vesicles
    - Secretion: Extracellular stimulus → Fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane → Release into the blood
    - Transport: Free transport in the blood
    - Principle of action: Binding to membrane-bound receptors (exception: thyroid hormones, which act like steroid hormones via intracellular receptors)
    - Half-life: Varies, e.g.:
        - Catecholamine: Minutes
        - Thyroid hormones: Bind to TBG and albumin for several days
- Steroid hormone
    - Structure: Sterane framework (C17H28) made up of three C6 rings and one C5 ring
    - Synthesis: Direct synthesis as needed in the mitochondria and on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum instead of storage in vesicles.
    - Secretion: Diffusion through the plasma membrane into the extracellular space and blood
    - Transport: Bound to plasma proteins
    - Mode of action: Diffusing through the lipid membrane, binding to intracellular receptors and thus primarily affecting transcription.
    - Half-life: Hours
    - Examples: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex hormones

> [!NOTE]
> Hydrophilic hormones (e.g., catecholamines) can be stored in vesicles and released when needed. Lipophilic hormones (e.g., steroid hormones of the adrenal cortex) are synthesized only when needed!

> [!NOTE]
> The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine are an exception among the amino acid derivatives. Although they are formed from the hydrophilic amino acid tyrosine, they acquire a lipophilic character through the synthesis steps. Therefore, they are transported in the blood bound to albumin, which gives them a significantly longer half-life than the other amino acid derivatives!

### Regulation

The formation and/or secretion of hormones is subject to complex regulatory circuits. These are detailed for each of the hormone-producing organs themselves!

### Reduction

Hormones are broken down differently depending on their chemical structure and biochemical properties.

- Peptide/Protein hormones: Proteolytic degradation, especially in the liver and kidneys.
- Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones: Biotransformation in the liver and excretion with bile
- Catecholamine: Enzymatic breakdown and excretion in urine
## Review Questions on the Chapter General Hormonal Properties
Explain the mechanisms of endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine secretion and provide an example of signaling molecules that act through each mechanism!
- Three mechanisms can be distinguished in the release of extracellular signaling substances: In endocrine signal transmission, the signaling molecule reaches its target cell via the blood (e.g., thyroid hormones), while the released messenger in the paracrine mechanism acts locally on neighboring cells through diffusion (e.g., somatostatin). An autocrine secreted signaling substance (e.g., interleukin 2) exerts its effect on the secreting cell itself or on neighboring cells of the same type.
What are hormones and how can they be classified based on their place of origin, chemical structure, and biochemical properties?
- Hormones are chemical signaling substances of various classes that are produced in specialized cells or endocrine glands. They are transported via the blood to their target cells and regulate metabolic and physiological parameters there (e.g., blood sugar, electrolyte balance). Depending on their place of origin, glandular and aglandular hormones are distinguished. Furthermore, based on their chemical structure, peptide hormones, steroid hormones, and amino acid derivatives can be differentiated. The chemical structure also influences the water solubility of the hormones and thus defines their belonging to hydrophilic or lipophilic hormones.
