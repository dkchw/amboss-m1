# Neurophysiological Investigations and Sleep
## Summary

Neurophysiological examination methods are used to obtain information regarding the function of the nervous system. The most commonly used method is electroencephalography (EEG), which records cortical potential fluctuations that can provide insights into neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy, sleep disorders). Generally, one distinguishes whether EEG waves occur spontaneously – that is, without sensory stimulation – or event-related – that is, in anticipation of or as a consequence of a stimulus (= event-related potentials). These event-related potentials allow conclusions to be drawn about neuronal processing processes and are therefore often used to address neuroscientific questions. With the help of EEG, different states of consciousness can also be distinguished. Thus, sleep is divided into the so-called non-REM sleep stages (N1–N3) and REM sleep. Even in awake patients, it is possible to differentiate via EEG whether the subject is currently in an excited or more relaxed state.

In addition, the neurophysiological examination within the analysis of cerebral activity increasingly includes modern imaging techniques such as, for example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
## Electroencephalography (EEG)

- Definition: Derivation of the summed cortical potential fluctuations
- Principle
    - Each individual neuron generates electrical state changes depending on its activity.
    - The EEG can measure these state changes summed at various points and thus visualize the activity of groups of neurons at different points of the cortex.
    - The examiner can then search the derived potential fluctuations for unusual patterns.
    - The fundamental potential fluctuations in sleep and in the awake state without stimulus influence (i.e., "spontaneous") are referred to as spontaneous EEG.
    - DC-Potential: Particularly slow, complex, and error-prone fluctuations that are filtered out for classical EEG
        - As a correlate of general brain activity, they are, however, interesting for more specific questions.
- Background
    - The derived potential fluctuations correspond to the EPSPs (= excitatory postsynaptic potentials) and IPSPs (= inhibitory postsynaptic potentials) of the pyramidal cells
    - According to definition:
        - A positive potential fluctuation is a downward deflection in the EEG: This is caused either by EPSPs in deep cortical layers or by IPSPs in superficial layers.
        - A negative potential fluctuation is an upward deflection in the EEG: This is caused either by IPSPs in deep cortical layers or by EPSPs in superficial layers.
- Implementation
    - 6–19 electrodes are symmetrically distributed on the surface of the head and the electrical activity is measured.
    - Potential differences are derived between each pair of electrodes and recorded as EEG lines.
    - EEG lines are named after the two derivations whose potential difference they represent.
        - Here, O stands for occipital, F for frontal, P for parietal, and Fp for the frontal pole.
        - The digits denote the page: Odd numbers stand for the left hemisphere and even for the right hemisphere.
            - Example: O1-P3 is the potential difference between the left occipital and the left parietal derivation.
- Clinical Application
    - Epilepsy diagnostics (if interested see: Epilepsy & Generalized Epilepsies in childhood)
    - Consciousness status (Bispectral index in anesthesia; brain death diagnostics)
    - Sleep Medicine: Polysomnography (Determination of Sleep Phases)
- Interpretation
    - Based on the frequency of the different wave types
    - As a rule of thumb: High frequencies reflect strong neural activity, and the higher the frequency, the smaller the amplitude.

- Basically, two forms of rhythm are distinguished in the EEG
    - Synchronized EEG
        - Characteristic: Derivation points across different brain areas show waves with similar amplitude and frequency
        - EEG: Low frequency of waves, high amplitudes (Occurrence: Alpha waves)
        - Synchronization mechanism: There is a subcortical pacemaker: Thalamus → This generates synchronous pacemaker potentials → These are sent to the cortex via thalamocortical fibers → Leading to synchronous synaptic activity across multiple cortical areas
    - Desynchronized EEG
        - Characteristic: Derivation points across different brain areas show waves with different amplitudes and frequencies.
        - EEG: High frequency of waves, low amplitudes (Occurrence: Beta waves)
        - Desynchronization mechanism: There is a control center that regulates the flow of information from the thalamus to the cortex: The so-called ARAS → This inhibits the pacemaker potential of the thalamus → Decreasing synchrony of the cortex
## Event-Related and Evoked Potentials

Basically, a distinction is made between whether EEG waves occur spontaneously, meaning without sensory stimulation, or event-related, meaning in anticipation of or as a result of a stimulus (= event-related potentials). Simply put, event-related potentials (ERPs) are measurable changes in potential that reflect neuronal processing processes. By specifically stimulating a sense organ or peripheral nerves, ERPs can be induced and subsequently measured - this method is used, for example, in the so-called evoked potentials in neurological diagnostics.

### Event-Related Potentials (ERP)

- Definition: In EEG, measurable cortical potential changes that occur in reproducible temporal correlation with a detectable and also reproducible event and reflect its sensory and cognitive processing (e.g., expectation, attention, decision-making, response preparation).
- Mess principle: The EKP waves (so-called components) are much smaller than those of the spontaneous EEG and can only be represented using so-called summation techniques.
- Evaluation: The EKPs are characterized by amplitude (size and polarity), latency, and topography.
- Prominent EKPs, e.g.
    - Exogenous EKPs: Primarily reflect sensory stimulus processing and are also referred to as early potentials.
        - N100: Negative potential shift that can typically be detected about 100 ms after an usually acoustic stimulus.
    - Endogenous EKPs: Primarily reflect cognitive stimulus processing and are also referred to as late potentials.
        - P300: Positive potential shift that can typically be detected approximately 300 ms after a stimulus bilaterally in the parietal cortex areas.
    - Readiness potential: Can be measured approximately 1 second before a planned voluntary movement (e.g., tapping the index finger) bilaterally in extensive areas of the precentral and parietal cortex.
    - Contingent negative variation (Expectation potential): Negative potential fluctuation that occurs in anticipation of an imperative stimulus.

Clinical application of ERPs: Evoked Potentials (EPs)

- Definition: Reduced form of the EPs, which only represents the sensory component of the processing of a reproducible somatosensory (or motor) stimulus, e.g., visual, acoustic, somatosensory, or motor-evoked potentials
    - Testing occurs without instruction for further cognitive stimulus processing.
    - Derivation of potentials occurs without a complete EEG derivation and can be limited to the primary cortical area with few electrodes.
- Evaluation: In pathologies along the examined conduction pathways (including peripheral nerves/nerve roots and central pathways in spinal cord and brain), there may be disturbances in the conduction of action potentials.
    - Pathologies can manifest as reproducible latency prolongation and/or amplitude reduction of the EPs.
    - Pathologies can be traced back to specific sections of the examined pathway for localization diagnostics, depending on the test setup.

## Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

- Short description
    - Variant of the MRI examination, in which functionally active brain areas are displayed.
    - "Normal" MRI examination: A cross-sectional imaging technique that operates with alternating magnetic fields. In the MRI examination, no ionizing radiation is used (unlike in computed tomography). Long-term side effects of this examination are not currently known.
- Principle: Active brain areas show an increased metabolic consumption and are accompanied by an increase in blood flow: The oxygenation level of the blood serves here as a kind of endogenous contrast agent.
    1. Increased activity in a brain area
    2. Increased energy consumption
    3. Increase in blood circulation
    4. Increase of oxygenated hemoglobin
        - Sog. BOLD effect occurs: This effect is based on the fact that oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin have different magnetic properties.
    5. Different magnetic properties are encoded by different colors and allow for the visual representation of active brain areas.
- Advantages of the method
    - High spatial resolution: It is in the range of a few millimeters, while the EEG only allows for a very coarse local classification.
    - Works without ionizing radiation
## Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)

- Brief description: Non-invasive optical method for continuous monitoring of regional tissue oxygenation
- Principle
    - Different light absorption for oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin
    - NIRS devices emit defined near-infrared light, which is absorbed differently by oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin; possibility of ratio determination
- Application: In particular, for the assessment of cerebral perfusion

> [!NOTE] Pulse oximetry
> Another method for measuring oxygen saturation is pulse oximetry. However, this does not measure the oxygen saturation of a tissue (e.g., the brain), but rather that of the peripheral arterial blood (e.g., at the finger).

## Sleep

### Sleep Phases and Stages

On average, 4–5 sleep cycles are completed during a night’s sleep, each lasting about 90 minutes.

- Every sleep cycle consists of
    - Non-REM Sleep
    - REM sleep (so-called paradoxical sleep)
- Special feature: In the first half of sleep, non-REM sleep predominates; in the further course, REM sleep increases.

#### Non-REM Phase

Non-REM sleep can be divided into three stages and is characterized by a rather synchronized EEG.

- Process
    - Can be divided into three stages, which exhibit different EEG patterns and are sequentially traversed during the process of falling asleep.
        - With increasing sleep depth (stages N1–N3 or I–IV), the frequencies of EEG waves decrease and their amplitudes increase – the EEG becomes increasingly synchronized.
    - After stage IV or N3, the sleep stages are traversed again in reverse order until REM sleep occurs.
    - Exception: After total sleep deprivation, deep sleep (stage IV or N3) is usually compensated for first, followed by REM sleep.
- Special Features
    - Wake threshold increases with advancing sleep stage (N3 > N2 > N1 or IV > III > II > I)
    - Low breathing and heart rate
    - Decreased blood pressure
    - Reduced core body temperature

#### REM-Phase

During REM sleep, the actual dream sleep occurs. It is also referred to as paradoxical sleep because it shows characteristics of deep sleep (high awakening threshold), while the EEG resembles that of the waking state (desynchronized pattern).

- Features
    - High wake threshold
    - Those who are awakened from REM sleep more frequently report dreams.
    - Loss of tone in the striated muscle
    - Typical rapid eye movements (REM = Rapid Eye Movement)
    - Increased respiratory and heart rate as well as blood pressure
    - Parasympathetic reactions
        - Narrow pupils (= sleep miosis)
        - Penis- or clitoral erection
- EEG: Resembles the waking state
    - A rather desynchronized pattern with phases of theta waves
- In the case of selective deprivation of REM sleep, there is a compensatory increase in the proportion of REM sleep in the following nights (known as REM rebound).

> [!NOTE]
> Total sleep deprivation initially leads to a decrease in concentration and attention. With prolonged duration, so-called microsleep episodes occur, which can be accompanied by visual perceptual disturbances. Selective deprivation of REM sleep leads to hyperactivity and irritability!

> [!NOTE] Sleep Deprivation Therapy
> Sleep deprivation can have a mood-lifting effect in the short term, which is why the so-called sleep deprivation therapy is sometimes used to break through severe depressive episodes. It is generally used in combination with other therapeutic approaches and is overall rather rarely employed, especially in cases of pronounced morning lows or severe sleep disorders.

### Sleeping Throughout Life

- With increasing age
    - If sleep duration decreases: Newborns sleep about 16–18 hours per day!
    - The sleep profile changes: The proportion of REM sleep in total sleep decreases.

### Day-Night Rhythm

The circadian rhythm follows a 24-hour cycle; it is therefore circadian (from Latin circa = "around" and dies = "day"). For this purpose, the body has a so-called internal clock.

- Involved tempo setters
    - Endogenous pacemaker (= internal clock): Suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus
    - Exogenous Zeitgeber (= external clock): Light signals (light/dark)
- Principle: Light signals received by special ganglion cells of the retina are transmitted via the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and integrated there.
    - → The suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronizes the internal clock with the external clock.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Neurophysiological Investigations and Sleep
### Electroencephalography (EEG)

What is referred to as spontaneous EEG?
- An EEG is the recording of cortical potential fluctuations on the scalp. A spontaneous EEG refers to a recording without specific stimulus input, that is, an EEG in the general sleep or waking state.

Which potential fluctuations of which cells are measured in the EEG exactly?
- Precisely, the excitatory (EPSP) and inhibitory (IPSP) postsynaptic potentials of cortical pyramidal cells are measured in the EEG. They are distinguished based on their deflection direction; positive potentials in the EEG correspond to a downward deflection, negative potentials to an upward deflection. EPSPs are negative in superficial cortical layers and positive in deep layers; for IPSPs, it is exactly the opposite.

Which physiological EEG waves are distinguished? What are their respective frequencies?
- In the EEG, delta (δ), theta (θ), alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) waves can be distinguished. Starting with delta waves at about 3 Hz, the frequency approximately doubles each time (δ ≈ 3 Hz, θ ≈ 6 Hz, α ≈ 12 Hz, β ≈ 24 Hz, γ ≈ 48 Hz).

In what state can alpha waves be derived? What type of rhythm characterizes them?
- Alpha waves can be recorded in the waking state with closed eyes. They belong, along with delta waves, to the synchronized EEG rhythm and are characterized by a low frequency with high amplitude.

What types of waves can be derived in the awake state?
- In the waking state, alpha, beta, and gamma waves can be recorded. Alpha waves are characteristic of a waking state with closed eyes, beta waves for an attentive state with open eyes, and gamma waves for strong concentration with open eyes.

What type of wave is generated during dreamless deep sleep phases?
- During the transition into as well as during dreamless deep sleep phases (stage III/IV or N3 of non-REM sleep), delta waves can be recorded. This sleep is also called slow-wave sleep.

Which brain region is responsible for a synchronized EEG rhythm?
- The central pacemaker for synchronized potentials is the thalamus. It transmits its synchronizing impulses to specific cortical areas, leading to synchronous synaptic activities there.

### Event-related and evoked potentials

Event-correlated potentials can be divided into endogenous and exogenous types. Explain the similarity and difference!
- All event-related potentials (ERP) are cortical potential differences measurable in the EEG. They differ in the reason that triggers the potential fluctuation. Endogenous ERPs arise from psychological processing processes. ERPs triggered by physical stimuli (e.g., acoustic or somatosensory) are called exogenous or also "early" potentials.

What is meant by a readiness potential?
- The readiness potential can be recorded bilaterally in the EEG about 1 second before a planned movement. It thus precedes the actual voluntary movement and indicates the readiness for an action.

When is one referred to as a potential of expectation and what is it also called?
- The expectation potential can be recorded between two stimuli, when a second is expected as a consequence of a preceding stimulus. It is also called contingent negative variation because it is a negative potential fluctuation.

What is meant by evoked potentials and what types do you know?
- Evoked potentials are event-related potentials triggered by a specific stimulus. These can be visual (visual evoked potentials), acoustic (acoustic evoked potentials), somatosensory (somatosensory evoked potentials), or motor (motor evoked potentials) stimuli.

How are evoked potentials used clinically?
- In neural pathologies, delayed stimulus conduction can occur, meaning the corresponding evoked potentials are recorded in the EEG with delayed latency and/or reduced amplitude.

### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

What is represented in a fMRI? What principle underlies it?
- In fMRI, functionally active brain areas are color-coded. It is based on the BOLD effect. This uses the oxygen content of the blood as a "contrast agent," since oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin have different magnetic properties. Active areas are better perfused due to increased metabolism, which is reflected in fMRI by an increased proportion of oxygenated blood.

Name the advantages of fMRI!
- fMRI offers high spatial resolution and can depict areas with accuracy down to a few millimeters. Additionally, unlike computed tomography, it operates without ionizing radiation.

### Sleep

What does the EEG of a person in deep sleep look like?
- The EEG of the deep sleep phase is characterized by a synchronized rhythm consisting of over 50% delta waves.

How does the EEG change with increasing sleep depth?
- The deeper the sleep (N1 < N2 < N3), the more synchronized the EEG; frequency decreases and amplitude increases.

Which waves are dominant during REM sleep and what is REM sleep also called because of that?
- The EEG of REM sleep shows a desynchronized rhythm. It mainly contains beta waves with occasional phases of theta waves. Because of its similarity to the waking state EEG, it is also called paradoxical sleep.

Name physical characteristics of REM sleep!
- Typical for REM sleep are the eponymous rapid eye movements with largely otherwise lost tone of the striated muscles. Respiratory and heart rates are increased, as is blood pressure. Additionally, there is difficulty in awakening and high dream activity.

How does sleep activity change throughout life?
- With increasing age, sleep duration and the proportion of REM sleep within total sleep time steadily decrease. While newborns still sleep 16–18 hours a day, a 50-year-old person sleeps on average only 6 hours.

How do REM and non-REM sleep relate to each other throughout the course of the night?
- In the first half of the night, non-REM sleep predominates; this decreases in favor of REM sleep over the course of the night. In the second half of the night, REM sleep predominates.

Name typical characteristics of the N2 non-REM sleep phase!
- The N2 phase of non-REM sleep marks the beginning of sleep with an increased awakening threshold. Typically, theta waves, K-complexes, and sleep spindles occur.
