# Respiratory Mechanics
## Summary

Under respiratory mechanics, one understands the physical processes that occur during inhalation and exhalation. During inspiration, the use of the respiratory muscles leads to an increase in intrathoracic volume, creating a negative pressure in the lungs that draws air into the lungs. Due to the elastic fibers of the lung parenchyma, the lungs passively contract when the respiratory muscles relax, thereby expelling the exhaled air (expiration).

To check the function of the lungs, lung volumes can be determined. Clinically, the vital capacity is particularly important. It is defined as the volume difference between maximum inhalation and exhalation. In so-called restrictive lung diseases, the vital capacity is reduced. Obstructive lung diseases, on the other hand, can be revealed by the dynamic Tiffeneau test: In this test, the subject is to exhale as quickly as possible and as much as possible after maximum inspiration.

The terms compliance and resistance describe how the lung reacts to deformations during breathing: High compliance indicates a low mechanical deformability of the lung. High resistance, on the other hand, means that the inhaled air must overcome a high flow resistance, thus hindering breathing.
## Process of Breathing

- Purpose of respiration: Exchange of air in the lungs
- Phases of Breathing
    - Resting respiration: Between every two breaths, inspiratory and expiratory forces are in balance, and the intrapulmonary pressure corresponds to the air pressure.
    - Inspiration
        - Inspiratory respiratory muscles cause an increase in thoracic volume.
        - The pleura (visceral pleura) adheres to the inner thoracic wall (parietal pleura or costal pleura) through the fluid film in the pleural space → lung volume is also increased.
        - As the lung volume increases, the intrapulmonary pressure decreases → Negative pressure in the lung
        - Air follows the pressure gradient into the lungs → Inspiration
    - Exspiration
        - Reduction of thoracic volume due to passive restoring forces of the lung
        - Reduction of lung volume → Overpressure in the lung
        - Air follows the pressure gradient out of the lungs → Expiration

> [!NOTE]
> Children primarily breathe in their abdomen, adults in their thorax!

> [!NOTE] Use of the respiratory accessory muscles as a sign of dyspnea
> In some lung diseases, breathing can become difficult for various reasons. To support the overloaded inspiratory respiratory muscles, the accessory respiratory muscles are often utilized. Affected individuals typically brace themselves with their hands or elbows on their knees ("tripod position"), which helps to stabilize the attachment point of the pectoralis major muscle on the humerus, allowing the muscle to transfer its strength to the chest and thus assist with breathing. The use of accessory respiratory muscles is a clinical sign of shortness of breath ("dyspnea") and can already be observed upon inspection.

## Pressure in the Lung and Pleura

The pressure changes during breathing are the driving force for inhalation and exhalation. The negative pressure in the pleura is necessary to transmit the movement of the thorax to the lung.

> [!NOTE] Pneumothorax
> If air enters the pleural space, the existing negative pressure cannot be maintained. As a result, the retraction forces of the lung predominate and the affected lung lobe collapses. Causes include, for example, penetrating injuries (= traumatic pneumothorax) or spontaneous ruptures of bullous changes in the lung tissue (= idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax). Clinically, this manifests, among other things, as suddenly onset, breath-dependent pain in the chest, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Therapeutically, the placement of a chest drain is often performed, which restores the negative pressure in the pleural space through suction. This allows the lung lobe to expand again or to adhere to the thoracic wall.

## Lung Volumes

The lung volumes describe how much air is present in the lungs or can be inhaled or exhaled. They are important baseline values to objectively assess pathological changes in lung architecture.

| Lung Volumes                       |     |                                                                            |                     |               |
| ---------------------------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
|                                    |     | Definition                                                                 | Calculation rule    | Normal value  |
| Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV)   |     | Air volume that can be additionally inhaled after normal inspiration       | –                   | Approx. 3 L   |
| Tidal Volume (TV)                  |     | The volume of air that is inhaled and exhaled during one respiratory cycle | –                   | Approx. 0.5 L |
| Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)    |     | Air volume that can be exhaled additionally after normal expiration        | –                   | Approx. 1.7 L |
| Residual volume (RV)               |     | Air volume that remains in the lungs after maximum exhalation              | –                   | Approx. 1.3 L |
| Composite Lung Volumes             |     |                                                                            |                     |               |
| Vital capacity (VC)                |     | Volume difference between maximum inhalation and exhalation                | VC = IRV + TV + ERV | Approx. 5.2 L |
| Total Lung Capacity (TLC)          |     | Total gas volume in the lungs after maximal inspiration                    | TLC = VC + RV       | Approx. 6.5 L |
| Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) |     | Volume remaining in the lungs after normal exhalation                      | FRC = ERV + RV      | Approx. 3 L   |
| Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)   |     | Air volume that can be maximally inspired after normal expiration          | IRV = VT + IRV      | Approx. 3.5 L |

> [!NOTE]
> At maximum expiration, the expiratory reserve volume is exhaled – since it does not leave the lungs during resting breathing, it contains the same gas mixture as the alveolar space!

> [!NOTE] Increased residual volume in pulmonary emphysema
> In pulmonary emphysema, the interalveolar septa are destroyed for various reasons. The breakdown of supportive proteins in the extracellular matrix leads, among other things, to increased elasticity (compliance) of the lung tissue. As a result, the resistance that the lung tissue opposes to the incoming air decreases, which is why even small pressure differences lead to the intake of large volumes that cannot be exhaled afterward. This creates large, air-filled cavities in the lung (so-called "bullae") that do not participate in gas exchange. In pulmonary emphysema, both compliance and residual volume are therefore increased.

### Dynamic Breathing Tests

With the help of dynamic breathing tests, lung function can be characterized more accurately.

- Determination of the respiratory limit value
    - Breathing limit value: Maximum minute ventilation (Normal value: 120–170 L/min)
    - Execution: The patient should breathe in and out as quickly and deeply as possible for 10 seconds.
- Tiffeneau-Test: After a deep inspiration, the patient should exhale as much as possible as quickly as possible.
    - Two values are determined:
        - Forced Vital Capacity (FVC): Maximum exhaled volume
        - One-second capacity (FEV1): Maximum volume exhaled in the 1st second
            - Relative single-second capacity (rFEV1): Maximum volume exhaled in the first second as a proportion of FVC (Normal value 70%)

> [!NOTE] FEV1 in obstructive respiratory diseases
> The one-second capacity is used in the clinic to assess the severity of obstructive airway diseases such as bronchial asthma or COPD. The FEV1 value is usually below 80% of the age-dependent target.

> [!NOTE] Restrictive or obstructive airway diseases
> With the help of rFEV1 and vital capacity, restrictive from obstructive airway diseases can be distinguished: In obstructive airway diseases, the VC is usually normal. However, expiration is hindered by the obstruction, resulting in a reduced FEV1 value. Even in restrictive airway diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, FEV1 is generally reduced. However, since the vital capacity is significantly reduced due to the decreased lung compliance, the relative one-second capacity rFEV1 is normal.

### Flow Volume Diagram

Both the lung volumes and the dynamic breathing parameter FEV1 can be read from the flow-volume diagram of respiration. This diagram can, for example, be determined as part of a spirometry (see below).

- Procedure: The subject performs a Tiffeneau test, during which the inhaled and exhaled volume and airflow are measured using a spirometer.
- Axes: The x-axis represents the volume present in the lungs, while the y-axis shows the air flow exiting the lungs.
- Description
    - Normal curve: Expiration is represented above the x-axis, inspiration below it.
        - Expiration: Start at the left edge of the diagram, initially steep rise, then linear decline of the flow values, ends at the right edge of the diagram.
            - The maximum point of the river values is referred to as Peak Flow.
            - The volume difference between the start and end of expiration corresponds to the vital capacity.
        - Inspiration: Start at the right edge of the diagram, semicircular curve, ends at the left edge of the diagram
    - Restrictive airway disease: "Egg-shaped" flow-volume curve, narrower than normal due to decreased vital capacity.
    - Obstructive airway disease: "Chair-shaped" flow-volume curve, expiratory flow values are decreased.
## Representation of the Pressure-Volume Relationships of the Lung

When one plots the pressure and volume of the lung under different conditions in a diagram, it is possible to draw conclusions about airway resistance and respiratory work. The pressure is plotted on the x-axis and the volume on the y-axis.

- Resting elongation curve of the lung and thorax
    - Implementation: Lung is passively filled with specific air volumes and the resulting intrapulmonary pressure is measured.
    - Description: S-shaped curve
    - Result: The steepness of the curve is referred to as compliance and is a measure of the passive stretchability of the lung.
- Dynamic Pressure-Volume Diagram
    - Implementation: During a normal breathing cycle, intrapulmonary and intrapleural pressure as well as the respiratory volumes are measured.
    - Description: Leaf-shaped curve
        - During inspiration, the intrapleural pressures are significantly more negative than during expiration (see table of pressure in the lung and pleura above).
    - Result: The area (pressure difference × volume difference) of the curve corresponds to the respiratory work, which consists of elastic work to overcome the elastic recoil forces and viscous work to overcome, among other things, the flow resistances of the airways.
- Dynamic pressure airflow strength diagram
    - Axes: Unlike in the pressure-volume diagrams, here the y-axis represents the airflow strength.
    - Implementation: During a normal breathing cycle, intrapulmonary pressure and airflow strength are measured (usually in the body plethysmograph)
    - Description: Loop-shaped curve
        - The inspiration requires higher pressures due to the flow resistance.
    - Result: The reciprocal of the curve slope is referred to as resistance; it is the dynamic airway resistance.
## Lung compliance

Compliance refers to the stretchability of lung and thoracic tissue – as it expands during inspiration, high compliance facilitates breathing.

- Definition: Measure of the "passive" extensibility, created by the elastic recoil forces of the lung and thorax.
- Calculations
    - Lung or Thorax (alone): C = ΔV/ΔP
    - Total system (Lung + Thorax): 1/Ctotal = 1/CLung + 1/CThorax
- Conclusion
    - Compliance is the volume change that can be induced by a specific change in pressure.
    - A high compliance thus means a high stretchability.
    - In the area of quiet breathing, compliance is highest.
- Division: The elasticity during breathing depends on the elasticity of the thorax and the lungs.
    - Compliance of the Thorax: Volume change of the thorax per pressure change in the pleural space
    - Lung compliance: Volume change of the lung per pressure change in the lung compared to the pleural space.
        - CLunge = ΔVL/Δ(PPul-PPleu)
        - Depends on (the following factors reduce compliance)
            - Restoring force of the elastic fibers (responsible for about ⅓ of the compliance)
            - Restoring force through the surface tension in the alveoli (responsible for about ⅔ of compliance) → Reduced by surfactant
- Determination: using the relaxation expansion curve

> [!NOTE] Apnea syndrome in newborns
> In preterm infants, surfactant is often produced in insufficient amounts. This decreases lung compliance, as the surface tension in the alveoli "pulls" the lung together. This can often be treated with supportive positive pressure ventilation or the intratracheal administration of surfactant.

> [!NOTE] Compliance in restrictive ventilatory disorders
> In restrictive ventilation disorders such as pulmonary fibrosis, the lung's compliance (or stretchability) is reduced: The loose alveolar framework with its elastic fibers is transformed into less stretchable connective tissue. As a result, the lung can no longer expand properly during inspiration, the vital capacity is reduced, and shortness of breath occurs.

> [!NOTE] Mechanical Ventilation
> Machine ventilation is used when there is insufficient or completely absent spontaneous breathing. In contrast to physiological breathing, where a negative pressure is created during inhalation by the respiratory muscles, allowing the air to be "sucked" into the lungs' airways, mechanical ventilation operates using positive pressure. The breathing gas is "pushed" into the lungs by the ventilator. To prevent the alveoli from collapsing during exhalation, an artificial positive pressure is maintained even during expiration. However, excessively high pressures can lead to overdistension or injuries to the lungs (barotrauma) and can negatively affect cardiac dynamics.

## Airway Resistance (Resistance)

Resistance refers to the resistance that the inhaled air must overcome while flowing through the airways. It primarily arises from the flow resistance of the airways and is, for example, increased in the context of obstructive airway diseases.

- Definition: Measure of the "active" airway resistance that arises from friction during breathing and the flow resistance of the airways.
- Normal value: 0.2 (kPa × s)/L
- Calculation: R = Intrapulmonary Pressure / Volume Flow Rate
- Conclusion
    - A high resistance means that a higher pressure difference between the lungs and the outside air must be generated to inspire a volume → It acts oppositely to compliance.
    - A high resistance also means that the respiratory effort is greater.
- Physical background of resistance
    - Airway resistance according to the Hagen-Poiseuille law (approx. 90%)
        - In the case of rapid breathing (e.g., forced expiration) or narrowed airways increased → Higher resistance
        - Is decreased with increasing lung volume → Lower resistance
    - Friction on the fabric (approx. 10%)
- Regulation of resistance via the autonomic nervous system: Increased sympathetic tone decreases resistance, while increased vagal tone increases resistance.
- Determination: Through body plethysmography

> [!NOTE] Resistance in obstructive respiratory diseases
> In obstructive respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD, the airways are narrowed. According to the Hagen-Poiseuille law, the flow resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the bronchial radius: If the bronchi, for example, are narrowed to half of their diameter, this results in a sixteenfold (!) increase in flow resistance and resistance!

## Lung Function Test

With the help of pulmonary function tests, the various lung volumes are measured to detect pathological lung ventilation.

### Spirometry

- Definition: Routine examination with a portable pneumotachograph for determining lung volumes and airflow velocities.
- Determinable Parameters
    - Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1)
    - Vital capacity (VC)
    - Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF): Maximum airflow during forced expiration (in l/s); this is derived from the highest point in the flow-volume diagram or from the slope at the steepest point of the expiration curve in the volume-time diagram.
- In closed system spirometry, the decrease in spirometer volume corresponds to the O2 uptake of the subject being investigated, as the exhaled CO2 is absorbed.

### Body Plethysmography

- Definition: Routine procedure for the exclusion of a pulmonary functional impairment
- Principle
    - Analogous to rest spirometry (see above), only now the patient is sitting in a closed cabin (whole-body plethysmograph)
    - Through the changing cabin pressure, the total lung capacity and the intrathoracic gas volume can be determined, as the pressure changes in the chamber are inversely proportional to those in the alveoli (the product of volume and pressure according to Boyle's Law remains constant)
- Possible indications
    - In case of insufficient cooperation/collaboration from the patient or to objectify the spirometric findings
    - Suspected emphysema
- Determinable Parameters
    - All parameters of spirometry
    - Resistance (R, airway resistance)
    - Residual volume
    - Total lung capacity: The pressure is measured at the closed mouthpiece (so-called closure pressure measurement).
        - From this, the total capacity can subsequently be calculated.
    - Intrathoracic gas volume (IGV, ITGV): Can also be determined through occlusion pressure measurement.
    - With an additional esophageal pressure probe: Compliance
## Review Questions on the Chapter Respiratory Mechanics
### Process of Breathing

What is the so-called respiratory rest position and at what point in the respiratory cycle does it occur?
- The respiratory rest position refers to the state in which the (expiratory) retracting forces of the lungs and the (inspiratory) forces with which the thorax pulls the lungs apart are in equilibrium. This occurs at the end of the normal expiration, i.e., between two breaths.
What causes inhalation and exhalation during normal resting breathing?
- During normal resting breathing, the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles are primarily involved in inspiration. During deep inhalation, the accessory respiratory muscles (e.g., the scalene muscles) also contract supportively. Expiration during resting breathing is caused by the elastic recoil forces of the lungs. Due to the elastic fibers of the parenchyma and the surface tension in the alveoli, the lungs are under constant tensile stress. Therefore, at rest, active muscular work is only required during inspiration, while during expiration, air is passively pressed out of the lungs.
Which two muscle groups support forced expiration? Describe their process!
- Forced expiration is primarily supported by the internal intercostal muscles and the abdominal muscles (e.g., rectus abdominis, internal and external oblique muscles). Their contraction compresses the lungs and creates an intrapulmonary overpressure. The air follows the pressure gradient and exits the lungs.
### Pressure in the Lung and Pleura

In what range does the intrapleural pressure fluctuate during a breathing cycle?
- The intrapleural pressure is always negative because the elastic recoil forces of the lungs create a vacuum. As a result, movements of the thorax are transferred to the lungs. At the end of inspiration, the pressure difference compared to atmospheric pressure is greatest (-0.7 kPa), and during expiration it decreases again (-0.5 kPa).
In the resting position of respiration, the pressure in the lungs corresponds to the atmospheric pressure. How do the intrapulmonary pressure conditions change during the subsequent inspiration?
- During inspiration, the thoracic volume expands due to the contraction of the respiratory muscles. Since the lung surface adheres firmly to the inside of the thorax, it also expands and the alveolar volume increases. This creates a negative pressure (-0.1 kPa) relative to ambient air pressure, drawing air into the lungs.
### Lung Volumes

Define vital capacity! Which group of respiratory diseases leads to a reduction?
- Vital capacity refers to the lung volume between maximum inspiration and maximum expiration and amounts to about 5.2 L in a healthy adult. In the case of a restrictive ventilatory disorder (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis), connective tissue remodeling occurs, reducing the lung’s volume compliance. Therefore, the lung cannot properly expand on inspiration and the vital capacity is correspondingly decreased.
What is functional residual capacity? In which disease is it typically increased?
- Functional residual capacity is the volume remaining in the lungs after normal exhalation (residual volume + expiratory reserve volume = approx. 3 L). In pulmonary emphysema, there is destruction of the interalveolar septa and loss of elastic fibers. The loss of elasticity makes expiration difficult, and emphysema bullae (cavities containing air that does not participate in gas exchange and is barely exhaled) form. This “gas trapping” results in an increase in residual volume and lung hyperinflation.
What lung volumes make up the total lung capacity? On which axis of the flow-volume diagram can it be read?
- Total lung capacity encompasses the entire gas volume in the lungs after maximum inspiration. It is formed by the sum of vital capacity and residual volume and is displayed on the x-axis of the flow-volume diagram.
How is the relative one-second capacity (Tiffeneau index) measured? What is its normal value and how does it change in restrictive or obstructive airway diseases?
- To measure the one-second capacity, the patient is asked to exhale as much as possible as quickly as possible after a deep inspiration. The Tiffeneau index, or relative one-second capacity, is the volume exhaled in the first second as a proportion of the total exhaled volume (forced vital capacity). The value should be at least 0.7 (70%) in healthy individuals. In purely restrictive airway diseases, it is typically normal, but in purely obstructive diseases, it decreases early.
At what point in the respiratory cycle does the curve of the flow-volume diagram intersect the x-axis?
- In the flow-volume diagram, the x-axis represents the volume (in liters) within the lungs, and the y-axis the airflow leaving the lungs (in liters per second). The curve intersects the x-axis when the y-value is zero, meaning no airflow is taking place. This occurs during transitions from inspiration to expiration and vice versa.
At what point in the respiratory cycle does the curve intersect the y-axis in the flow-volume diagram?
- In the flow-volume diagram, the x-axis shows lung volume (in liters) and the y-axis the airflow out of the lungs (in liters per second). The curve crosses the y-axis at the end of a maximal inspiration.
Which group of diseases typically causes a "chair-shaped" flow-volume curve?
- A “chair-shaped” flow-volume curve arises from a reduction in expiratory airflow, for example in obstructive ventilatory disorders. The maximal airflow rate is also reduced in such cases.
What is the lung volume called that can be mobilized in addition to the normal tidal volume during a maximum expiration? What is a special characteristic of its gas mixture?
- During maximal expiration, in addition to the normal tidal volume, the expiratory reserve volume (approx. 1.7 L) is exhaled. Since it leaves the lungs only during maximal effort and not during normal rest breathing, it contains the same gas mixture as the alveolar space.
### Lung compliance

What describes the compliance of the respiratory apparatus and what does it depend on?
- Compliance is a measure of the distensibility of lung and thoracic tissue and is based on their intrinsic elasticity. The stretch resistance of the thorax and lungs contribute roughly equally to the total stretch resistance. The rule is: the lower the resistance forces of the respiratory apparatus to stretching during inspiration, the higher its compliance.
One can consider compliance for both the individual components of the lung and thorax, as well as for the entire system. What is the formula for calculating total compliance (lung and thorax)?
- The total compliance of lungs and thorax results from the sum of the reciprocal values of lung and thorax compliance: 1/C_total = 1/C_lung + 1/C_thorax.
The change in the compliance of the ventilator during the breathing cycle can be illustrated using the resting pressure-volume curve. At what point is the compliance the highest?
- The resting pressure-volume curve of the entire apparatus shows an S-shaped course. Around the respiratory rest position, the curve is steepest; that is, compliance is highest here. The force the respiratory muscles need to overcome the elastic resistances is therefore lowest in the range of physiological resting breathing. Compliance decreases successively both during inspiration and expiration, as the slope of the curve becomes less steep.
What do the restoring forces of lung tissue depend on and how do they influence lung compliance?
- Lung tissue compliance depends about one-third on the restoring force of the elastic fibers and about two-thirds on the restoring force from the surface tension of the alveoli. The greater these forces are, the lower the compliance.
What effect does a lack of surfactant have on lung compliance?
- Surfactant reduces the surface tension in the alveoli. If there is a deficiency, the tendency of the alveoli to collapse predominates, and some even partially collapse. Lung expansion is thus hindered and its compliance reduced. Surfactant deficiency is the cause of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and usually occurs in premature infants whose lungs are not yet able to produce adequate surfactant.
How does the intrapleural pressure change in the case of decreased lung compliance (e.g., in pulmonary fibrosis)?
- In a restrictive ventilatory disorder such as pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue remodeling replaces elastic fibers with non-elastic ones. The distensibility (i.e., compliance) of the lungs is therefore reduced, and lung tissue can no longer adequately expand during inspiration. To inhale a certain volume, a stronger negative pressure in the pleural cavity is then required than in healthy individuals.
### Airway Resistance (Resistance)

How is airway resistance defined and what formula can be used to calculate it?
- Airway resistance refers to the resistance caused by the airflow resistance of the airways as well as friction during breathing. It is calculated as the ratio of intrapulmonary pressure to airflow rate.
How does the resistance change with faster breathing compared to resting breathing?
- At higher flow velocities, turbulence causes increased flow and thereby higher airway resistance. During quiet breathing, airflow is laminar and must overcome correspondingly lower airway resistance.
### Lung Function Tests

What is body plethysmography? Which lung function parameters can be determined in addition to the parameters of spirometry?
- In body plethysmography, the patient sits in an airtight sealed chamber. This allows not only measurement of breathed volumes but also chamber pressure. In a sealed chamber, the pressure changes caused by the patient’s respiratory movements are inversely proportional to those in the alveoli. Using the pressure measurements, total lung capacity, intrathoracic gas volume, and residual capacity can be indirectly determined, as well as airway resistance.
Why must the subject breathe against a sealed mouthpiece during the determination of total lung capacity through body plethysmography?
- In body plethysmography, volumes are indirectly calculated by measuring pressures. To determine total lung capacity, the subject must breathe against a sealed mouthpiece. Since no pressure equilibration can occur via the airways, the pressure at the mouthpiece corresponds to the pressure in the lungs. From this, the volume remaining in the lungs and subsequently total lung capacity can be calculated.
