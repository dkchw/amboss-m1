# Adipose Tissue
## Summary

Adipose tissue is present throughout the body, including in the form of subcutaneous fat. Even though fat tissue is often mentioned in a negative context in everyday life, it performs important functions. On the one hand, it serves as a building and "insulating material" in the skin and organs. On the other hand, it is our energy storage for prolonged fasting periods. The energy storage function was particularly advantageous from an evolutionary perspective, but it remains of great importance even today: Infants maintain their body heat with the help of adipose tissue; in severe illnesses, the body's energy reserves also play a crucial role.

There are two types of fat tissue: Brown fat tissue serves to regulate the body temperature of the infant and diminishes over the course of life. White fat tissue, on the other hand, remains throughout life and is the most important energy reserve. In addition, white fat tissue also produces hormones.

## White Adipose Tissue

### Structure

- Macroscopic
    - Divided into lobules by vascular and nerve-containing connective tissue septa
    - Color: Yellow
- Microscopic
    - Unilocular adipocytes: Cells with a lipid vacuole and peripheral nucleus, surrounded by basal lamina and reticular fibers
    - Color: White
    - Immunohistochemical: The intermediate filament Vimentin is a typical immunohistochemical marker of adipocytes.

### Function

- Storage fat: Energy reserve for catabolic metabolic states, especially in subcutaneous adipose tissue.
    - Storage of fats in the form of triacylglycerols
    - Regulation
        - Increase in anabolic metabolic state: Lipogenesis↑ through hypertrophy (lipid vacuole grows) and hyperplasia (due to stem cell reserve) of adipocytes
        - Breakdown in a catabolic metabolic state: Lipolysis
- Insulating fat: Thermal insulation of the body in the form of subcutaneous fat tissue.
- Construction putty: pressure cushion for mechanically stressed areas (sole of the foot) or as a "retaining cushion" to fix organs in place (eyeball in orbit, renal pelvis in the renal sinus)
- Hormone secretion
    - Leptin
    - Estrogens (autonomous estrogen secretion through adipose tissue-specific aromatase)
- Reservoir for lipophilic biomolecules (e.g. fat-soluble vitamins)

### Occurrences

- Storage fat: Subcutaneous, abdominal cavity
- Insulating fat: Subcutaneous tissue
- Construction grease
    - Macroscopically visible: Orbit, coronary sulcus of the coronary arteries, renal fat capsule, sole of the foot, greater omentum
    - Microscopically visible: Small groups of adipocytes are found throughout the body's interstitium.

### Development

Mesoderm germ layer → Mesenchymal stem cells → Preadipocytes (mitotically active) → Adipocytes (mature, mitotically inactive)

> [!NOTE] Obesity
> Through a persistently high calorie intake beyond daily needs, it can lead to a pathological increase in white adipose tissue. A Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 and above is referred to as "obesity." Obesity is associated with an increased risk of numerous diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or joint disorders.

## Brown Adipose Tissue

### Structure

- Macroscopic
    - Color: Brown(-gray) due to high mitochondrial content (increased cytochrome concentration of the tissue)
    - Corresponds to the structure of white adipose tissue
- Microscopic: Consists of plurivacuolar adipocytes
    - Contain multiple small lipid vacuoles ("plurivacuolar")
    - Rich in mitochondria and capillaries (due to thermogenesis function)
    - Smaller than adipocytes of white adipose tissue

### Function of Brown Adipose Tissue

#### Thermogenesis (Heat Production)

- Mechanism: Uncoupling of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria via thermogenin (Uncoupling Protein, UCP-1)
- Process: Cold stimulus → Sympathetic activity↑ → Norepinephrine release → Stimulation of ß3-adrenoceptors in adipocytes for fat burning
    - In beta-oxidation, many reducing equivalents (NADH+H+, FADH2) are subsequently produced, which are fed into the respiratory chain.
    - At the same time, the proton channel thermogenin is incorporated into the inner mitochondrial membrane.
    - The protons that are pumped into the intermembrane space during the respiratory chain flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through thermogenin instead of through the ATP synthase.
    - The energy of the respiratory chain is then released not in the form of ATP, but in the form of heat.
- Meaning: Heat production of the newborn and in animals that hibernate.

### Occurrence

- In newborns: Specifically cervical and thoracic
- In adults: Only paravertebral, paravascular (along the major arteries), mediastinal, periclavicular

### Development

- Embryonal: Mesoderm germ layer → Mesenchymal stem cells → Brown adipose tissue
- In the adult organism: regression over the course of life

## Review Questions on the Chapter Adipose Tissue
### White adipose tissue

What are the main cells of adipose tissue called and how do they appear microscopically?
- The main cells of adipose tissue are called adipocytes. They appear as large, univacuolar cells with a peripheral nucleus and are surrounded by a basal lamina.

Which intermediate filament is characteristic of adipocytes?
- The intermediate filament vimentin is characteristic of adipocytes. It can therefore be used as an immunohistochemical marker.

Which hormones are secreted by white adipose tissue?
- White adipose tissue secretes leptin on the one hand. On the other hand, it is capable of synthesizing and secreting estrogens through its own adipose tissue aromatase.

### Brown Adipose Tissue

How does brown adipose tissue differ microscopically from white adipose tissue?
- The adipocytes of brown adipose tissue are smaller than those of white adipose tissue. They contain multiple vacuoles (plurivacuolar) and not just one. Additionally, the adipocytes of brown adipose tissue contain many mitochondria (which also cause their brown-gray color).

Which protein is characteristic of brown adipose tissue and what is its function?
- Thermogenin is characteristic of brown adipose tissue. In cold conditions, it is inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane and serves there as an additional proton channel, through which the proton gradient can be dissipated (so-called uncoupling of the respiratory chain). The energy of the respiratory chain is released by this uncoupling not in the form of ATP, but in the form of heat.
