# Thyroid
## Summary

The thyroid gland produces hormones as an endocrine organ that are essential for metabolic processes and body growth. It is located just below the larynx next to the trachea and is divided into two lobes connected by the isthmus. The parenchyma of the thyroid consists of numerous thyroid follicles that have a central lumen and are lined with follicular epithelium. In this epithelium, there are two types of endocrine cells: the thyrocytes produce the two thyroid hormones T3 and T4, while the C-cells produce calcitonin, which can influence calcium metabolism. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the thyroid gland as part of the episode on endocrine organs in the section on microscopic anatomy of the thyroid.

The parathyroid glands are small lens-shaped organs located dorsally to the thyroid gland. They are functionally not connected to the thyroid gland and are therefore treated separately in the chapter "Parathyroid Glands."
## Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland

### Macroscopic Anatomy

#### Profile

- Function: Endocrine gland for the production and storage of thyroid hormones
- Form
    - Supervision: Butterfly-/H-shaped
    - Cross-section: Horseshoe-shaped
- Volume
    - ♂ 15–25 mL
    - ♀ 10–18 mL
- Weight: 20–30 g

#### Structure

The thyroid gland consists of two lobes that are connected by a parenchymal bridge – the isthmus – and is surrounded by a double-layered capsule. From the inner capsule, connective tissue septa (so-called stroma) extend inward and divide the parenchyma into lobules (lobuli). Within these lobules lie the hormonally active thyroid follicles.

- Capsule: Connective tissue
    - Capsula externa: Outer capsule
    - Internal capsule: Internal capsule
- Lobby
    - Lobus dexter: Right Lobe
    - Lobus sinister: Left Lobe
    - Isthmus: Steg-like parenchymal connection between the two lobes
    - Pyramidalis lobe (normal variant, present in about 50%): A small additional thyroid lobe that extends cranially.
- Lobuli: Connective tissue septa (stroma) extend from the inner capsule into the interior and divide the parenchyma into lobules (lobuli).
    - Stroma: Connective tissue support framework with a fenestrated capillary network and nerves
    - Parenchyma: Glandular tissue with numerous vesicular hormone-active thyroid follicles

#### Topography

The thyroid gland is located ventrally in the neck area; the isthmus projects onto the 2nd to 3rd tracheal cartilage.

|Relationship of the Thyroid Gland|   |
|---|---|
|Dorsal|- Parathyroid glands<br>- Trachea<br>- Esophagus<br>- Recurrent laryngeal nerve<br>- Prevertebral lamina of the cervical fascia|
|Ventral|- Lamina praetrachealis of the cervical fascia|
|Lateral|- Vascular-Nerve Bundle of the Neck|

> [!NOTE]
> The two thyroid lobes can extend caudally to the upper thoracic aperture!

> [!NOTE] Recurrent paresis
> The recurrent laryngeal nerve is at risk during thyroid surgeries because its location on the dorsal side of the thyroid can easily be overlooked and injured by the surgeon. If the nerve is cut on one side, there is a risk of ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis, which leads to hoarseness. If the nerve is cut on both sides, there is a risk of bilateral paralysis, and severe shortness of breath and stridor may occur.

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Superior thyroid artery from external carotid artery|
|- A. inferior thyroid artery from the thyrocervical trunk|
|- A. thyroidea ima (normal variant, present in about 10%), mostly from the brachiocephalic trunk|
|Venous|- Superior thyroid vein into internal jugular vein<br>- Middle thyroid veins into internal jugular vein<br>- Thyroid plexus impar of inferior thyroid vein into left brachiocephalic vein|
|Innervation|   |
|Sensitive|- Superior laryngeal nerve from the vagus nerve<br>- Recurrent laryngeal nerve from the vagus nerve|
|Parasympathetic|
|Sympathetic|- Periarterial plexus of the cervical sympathetic nervous system|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph Nodes|- Thyroid nodes in deep anterior cervical nodes<br>- Paratracheal nodes|

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland

The thyroid parenchyma consists of numerous lobules. It is made up of the thyroid stroma and vesicle-like thyroid follicles, which contain two types of endocrine active cells. Each follicle is surrounded by a basement membrane and possesses a central lumen filled with a homogeneous secretion from the thyroid epithelial cells. This secretion is referred to as colloid.

## Function

The main function of the thyroid gland is the production of the hormones T3 and T4. They regulate both growth and many other essential metabolic processes of the body. Additionally, the hormone calcitonin is also produced in the thyroid gland, which can influence calcium balance.

## Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4)

### Overview

The thyroid gland secretes the two thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine, tetraiodothyronine). T4 is only slightly active on its own, but it is produced in significantly higher amounts. It is converted in the blood and in the cytosol of most body cells into the biologically more active T3 by a deiodinase. The half-life of T3 is about one day (approximately 20 hours), while that of T4 is about one week (approximately 190 hours). Thus, T4 represents a kind of "low-activity depot form" of the thyroid hormones.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **T3 (Triiodothyronine)** | - Most effective thyroid hormone                                               | - 3,3',5-Triiodothyronine      | 1 day         |
| **T4 (Thyroxine)**        | - Main synthesis product of the thyroid cells<br>- Less effective storage form | - 3,3',5,5'-Tetraiodothyronine | About 7 days  |

### Biosynthesis of Thyroid Hormones

The thyroid hormones are synthesized by the thyrocytes in the thyroid follicles. Initially, the iodide-free hormone precursors are stored in the follicular lumen in the form of thyroglobulin. Iodide is actively taken up by the thyrocytes when needed and also transported into the follicular lumen. Here, thyroperoxidase catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin. To release T3/T4, the iodinated thyroglobulin must be reabsorbed into the thyrocytes and then lysosomally degraded, so that the hormones can be released into the blood.

- Key enzyme: Thyreoperoxidase
- Synthesis sites: Thyroid cells and follicular lumen of the thyroid follicles

|Steps|Description|Location|
|---|---|---|
|1. Synthesis of Thyroglobulin (TG)|1. Formation of the precursor protein TG with tyrosine residues (rough ER)<br>2. Packaging into vesicles (Golgi apparatus)<br>3. Release into the follicular lumen by exocytosis and storage in the follicular lumen|- Thyrocyte → Follicular lumen|
|2. Uptake of Iodide|1. Basolateral Transport<br>    - Na+/I−-Symporter: Uptake of Iodide into the Thyrocyte<br>2. Apical Transport<br>    - Pendrin: Release of Iodide from the Thyrocyte into the Follicular Lumen|- Blood Vessel → Thyrocyte → Follicular Lumen|
|3. Iodination of Thyroglobulin|- Thyroperoxidase (TPO)<br>    1. Oxidation of iodide and iodination of the tyrosine residues of TG through electrophilic substitution<br>        1. Reaction: TG + H2O2 + I− → TG with two mono-iodinated tyrosine residues (=Monoiodotyrosine, MIT)<br>        2. Reaction: TG-MIT + H2O2 + I− → TG with two di-iodinated tyrosine residues (=Diiodotyrosine, DIT)<br>    2. Coupling of the iodinated tyrosine residues<br>        1. Oxidation of the two tyrosine residues to radicals<br>        2. Coupling through ether linkage → Formation of tetraiodothyronyl residues and triiodothyronyl residues<br>- NADPH oxidase: Apical enzyme for providing H2O2 for the thyroperoxidase<br>    - Reaction: NADPH + H+ + O2 → NADP+ + H2O2|- In the follicular lumen|
|4. Storage|- Bound to Thyroglobulin|- In the follicle lumen|
|5. Secretion|1. Reuptake of iodinated TG into a thyrocyte via endocytosis<br>2. Fusion of endocytic vesicle with lysosome<br>3. Proteolytic degradation of thyroglobulin with the release of T3 and T4<br>4. Release of T3 (approximately 20%) and T4 (approximately 80%) into the blood|- Thyrocyte → Capillary network|

> [!NOTE] Iodine deficiency goiter
> In some regions of the world, there is not enough iodine available for the formation of thyroid hormones. The compensatorily increased production of TSH represents a strong stimulus for the growth of the thyroid gland, so that the thyroid volume increases significantly – externally, a “goiter” may be visible. For prevention, table salt is iodized in many iodine-deficient areas – including Germany.

> [!NOTE]
> Thyroxine is formed from tyrosine!

### Transport and Dismantling

Thyroid hormones are poorly water-soluble; their transport in the blood therefore occurs bound to proteins.

- Transport in the blood: Bound to
    - Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)
    - Transthyretin (= Thyroxine-binding prealbumin, TBPA)
    - Serum albumin
- Breakdown (Liver): Sulfation/Glucuronidation as part of biotransformation → Excretion via bile

### Effect

#### Mechanism of Action

Since the thyroid hormones in serum mainly exist in the less active form of T4 (storage form), they must first be converted into T3.

1. Conversion of T4 (less effective depot form) to T3 in the periphery
    - Enzyme: Deiodase
        - Elimination of iodine at the 5'-C-atom of the outer ring
        - If the iodine is cleaved from the inner ring of T4, the inactive ("reverse") rT3 is formed (the reverse triiodothyronine has two iodine atoms on the outer ring and only one on the inner ring).
2. Binding to thyroid hormone receptors
    - Type: Hormone-sensitive transcription factors
    - Subtypes: TRα and TRβ
    - Occurrence: Almost all organs have receptors for thyroid hormones
    - Mechanism of action
        - Uptake of T3 and T4 into the cell through special transporters (e.g., MCT)
        - Binding of T3 to the ligand-gated receptor
        - Hormone receptor complex binds to proteins that stimulate the transcription of certain genes.

#### Effect on Target Organs

In general, thyroid hormones have a metabolic stimulating effect: oxygen and energy consumption as well as thermogenesis increase under their influence.

|Target organ|Effect|
|---|---|
|Heart|- Increased expression of cardiac β-receptors<br>- Increase in heart rate<br>- Rise in cardiac output|
|Lunge|- Stimulation of the respiratory center<br>- Oxygenation↑ through increased lung circulation|
|Skeletal Muscle|- Increased development of Type II muscle fibers (so-called "Fast-Twitch" muscle fibers)|
|Metabolism|- Basal metabolic rate↑ due to increased oxygen consumption↑ and increased body temperature↑<br>- Lipid metabolism: Depending on metabolic state, promotion of lipolysis (catabolic) or liponeogenesis (anabolic)<br>- Increase in all steps of carbohydrate metabolism: Glucose reabsorption↑, gluconeogenesis↑, glycogen synthesis↑, glucose oxidation↑<br>- Protein metabolism: Protein anabolism (in high doses: protein catabolism)<br>- Increased expression of Na+/K+-ATPase in many tissues|
|Growth in Childhood|- Skeletal Growth↑<br>- Body Growth↑: Biosynthesis and secretion of growth hormone<br>- Maturation of the Nervous System|
|Thermoregulation|- Heat production|

> [!NOTE]
> Thyroid hormones have both anabolic and catabolic effects in the body. Although this may sound contradictory, it makes sense: Catabolic processes provide energy for the body, while anabolic processes ensure sufficient "supply" by replenishing reserves!

### Regulation

The thyroid hormones, like the steroid hormones of the adrenal gland, are under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

- TRH (Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone, Thyreoliberin)
    - Synthesis site: Hypothalamus
    - Structure: N- and C-terminal modified tripeptide
    - Stimuli: Energy-promoting processes, e.g.: Cold exposure, stress, physical exertion
    - Inhibition: Only minimal feedback control of T3/T4 on TRH
    - Effect
        - Binding to G-protein-coupled receptor of thyrotropic cells in the anterior pituitary → Activation of phospholipase C → Inositol triphosphate↑
        - Stimulation of TSH synthesis, also increase in prolactin synthesis
- TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, Thyrotropin)
    - Synthesis site: Thyrotropic cells of the anterior pituitary gland
    - Structure: Glycoprotein
        - The glycoprotein β-hCG, which is significant for maintaining pregnancy, can bind to the TSH receptor due to its structural similarity and interfere with the regulation of the thyroid.
    - Stimulus: TRH
    - Inhibition
        - Stronger feedback mechanism regarding T3/T4: reduces TSH production
        - Somatostatin, dopamine, and glucocorticoids also have an inhibitory effect.
    - Effect (via binding to G-protein-coupled TSH receptor of thyrocytes)
        - Stimulation of T4/T3 synthesis
        - Stimulation of T4/T3 secretion (via stimulation of endocytosis of colloid into the thyrocytes)
        - Stimulation of iodide uptake in thyrocytes

> [!NOTE] TSH as a laboratory parameter
> The TSH level in the blood reacts very sensitively to disturbances in thyroid hormones: With excessively high levels, it can drop below the detection limit, and with excessively low levels, it can rise sharply. Therefore, the TSH measured in serum is an important parameter for assessing thyroid function and is clinically the first step in thyroid diagnostics.

### Thyroid Hormone Disorders

Disorders of thyroid hormones affect the entire body. Both hyperfunction and hypofunction are clinically significant disease patterns.

## Calcitonin

- Properties
    - Peptide hormone
    - Hydrophilic
- Synthesis
    - Syntheseort: C-cells of the thyroid gland
    - Synthesis steps: Procalcitonin → Proteolytic processing → Calcitonin
- Storage: Secretory granules
- Secretion: Exocytosis
- Regulation: Distribution at high Ca2+ levels
    - Calcium sensors of the C cells: Membrane proteins that register Ca2+ levels
    - High extracellular calcium → G-protein-coupled second messenger activation → Increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels → Increase in calcitonin secretion
- Effect
    - Lowering of the calcium level
    - Molecular mode of action
        - Binding to the membrane-bound calcitonin receptor
        - Coupled to G-protein or phospholipase C
    - Target organs
        - Bones: Inhibition of osteoclast activity
        - Kidney: Increased excretion of calcium and phosphate
        - Intestine: Slightly decreased absorption of calcium

> [!NOTE]
> The physiological role of calcitonin is minor - bone and calcium metabolism are regulated by the parathyroid hormone parathormone as well as by vitamin D. However, calcitonin is significant as a tumor marker for C-cell carcinoma and as a medication for lowering calcium levels. Additionally, the precursor procalcitonin is playing an increasingly important role as a marker for primarily bacterial inflammatory processes!

## Development

- Formation of the thyroid gland
    - Time: Starting from the 24th day
    - Development
        - Formation of an epithelial bud at the level of the first pharyngeal pouch (endoderm)
            - This place corresponds to the later foramen caecum of the tongue.
        - Starting from the epithelial bud, an epithelial strand grows distally.
        - Differentiation into a duct: Thyroglossal duct
        - From the distal solid end, two lobes arise that remain connected by an epithelial strand.
        - The remaining portions of the thyroglossal duct regress.
- Formation of the endocrine cells of the thyroid gland
    - Time: From the 10th week
    - Development
        - Thyroid cells: Differentiation from the epithelial cells of the thyroid gland (endoderm)
            - First endocrine active gland of the fetus
        - C cells: Differentiation from the ultimobranchial body in the 5th pharyngeal pouch
            - Ultimobranchial body: Paired cell strands that have migrated from the neural crest cells.
            - Immigration of the cell strands into the thyroid gland development
- The epithelial bodies of the parathyroid glands also originate from the pharyngeal pouches. The upper and lower epithelial bodies develop separately from each other.

> [!NOTE] Median neck cyst and fistula
> If the thyroglossal duct does not regress completely, a median neck cyst can develop. It is often symptomatic in childhood due to a supralaryngeal swelling and a feeling of pressure. If there is also an opening to the body's surface, it is referred to as a median neck fistula. When pressure is applied, a cloudy secretion may be discharged. Therapeutically, surgery with complete resection of the cyst/fistula tract is typically performed.

## Review Questions on the Thyroid Chapter
### Anatomy of the Thyroid Gland

Describe the structure of the thyroid follicles.
- Thyroid follicles are vesicle-like cavities lined by an epithelium composed of two cell types (thyrocytes and C-cells). The lumen is filled with colloid, the secretion of the thyrocytes.
Which arteries typically supply the thyroid gland? From which vessels do they originate?
- In about 90% of people, the thyroid is supplied by the superior thyroid arteries (from the external carotid artery) and inferior thyroid arteries (from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery). In a minority, a variably coursing thyroid ima artery is additionally present, usually arising from the brachiocephalic trunk.
### Triiodothyronine (T3) and Thyroxine (T4)

What is thyroglobulin and where is it synthesized?
- Thyroglobulin is a protein produced by thyrocytes. It is a hormone precursor containing numerous tyrosine side chains, through iodination of which thyroid hormones are formed.
Name the key enzyme of thyroid hormone biosynthesis. What two reactions does it catalyze and what additional compound does it require?
- Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. It catalyzes, in a redox reaction, first the oxidation of iodide using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Then, it catalyzes in several steps the iodination of thyroglobulin (TG) at specific tyrosine residues. From iodinated TG, the hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) can be released.
Where does the iodination of thyroglobulin take place, and how does the iodide get there beforehand?
- Iodide ions enter the cytosol of the follicular epithelial cells via a sodium-iodide symporter (secondary active transport: gradient maintained by Na+/K+-ATPase) and are transported from there into the follicle lumen through the active ion channel pendrin.
Through the iodination of thyroglobulin, mono- and diiodinated tyrosine residues (monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)) are formed, whose coupling together leads to the formation of T3 (one molecule of MIT with one molecule of DIT) and T4 (two molecules of DIT). By what chemical bond are these molecules linked?
- The coupling of iodinated tyrosine residues occurs via an ether bond "C—O—C" with the help of thyroperoxidase.
Where are the thyroid hormones stored until their release?
- Storage of T3/T4 occurs bound to thyroglobulin in the follicle lumen.
How is the release of T3/T4 from thyroglobulin accomplished?
- The iodinated thyroglobulin is endocytosed on demand into the cytosol of thyrocytes and completely proteolytically degraded in lysosomes. This releases T3 and T4 which can then be secreted into the blood.
How are T3/T4 transported in the blood?
- Thyroid hormones are poorly water-soluble (hydrophobic) and therefore circulate in the blood almost entirely bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).
How do T3 and T4 differ in terms of their plasma half-life and effectiveness? What function does this result in for the two hormones?
- The plasma half-life of T4 is about 7 days, significantly longer than that of T3 (about 1 day), while its effectiveness is considerably lower. Thus, T4 functions more as a "low-activity depot form" of thyroid hormones that can be converted into the more active form T3 when needed. The T3 to T4 ratio in blood is approximately 1:20.
Through which reaction is T4 converted to T3 in the periphery? How is the inactive reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) formed in a similar reaction?
- The conversion of T4 into its active form T3 occurs by removal of iodine at the 5'-carbon atom of the outer (phenol) ring. If T4 is deiodinated instead at the inner (tyrosyl) ring, the inactive rT3 is formed.
Through which regulatory loop is the secretion of thyroid hormones in the body regulated? What other hormones are involved in this process?
- Thyroid hormones are controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and regulated via the secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). At the same time, T3/T4 exert feedback effects on their secretion (especially on TSH).
Describe the mechanism of action of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) on the thyroid gland.
- TSH stimulates the synthesis and release of T3/T4 by binding to the G protein-coupled TSH receptor on thyrocytes.
What is the biochemical nature of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)?
- TRH is a modified tripeptide. The modifications at the amino- and carboxy-terminal amino acids protect the hormone from degradation by peptidases.
Describe the effect of thyroid hormones on the heart.
- Thyroid hormones bind to intranuclear receptors in cardiac muscle cells and increase the expression of β-receptors. This leads to increased sensitivity to catecholamines and consequently to an increase in heart rate, contractile force, and cardiac output.
What impact does a deficiency of thyroid hormones have on the basal metabolic rate? What symptoms does this lead to?
- Thyroid hormones increase the body's energy expenditure, so a deficiency leads to a reduced basal metabolic rate. This manifests with symptoms like feeling cold, low body temperature, fatigue, and weight gain.
Describe the effect of thyroid hormones on intestinal activity. What typical symptom occurs in case of an underactive thyroid?
- Thyroid hormones stimulate intestinal muscle. A deficiency due to hypothyroidism thus reduces intestinal activity and leads to constipation.
What changes in TSH and T3/T4 levels in the blood are typically observed in cases of hyperthyroidism (e.g., Graves' disease)?
- In hyperthyroidism, production of thyroid hormones T3/T4 is increased, so these are elevated in the blood. T3/T4, in turn, inhibit TSH secretion from the anterior pituitary by negative feedback, so TSH is reduced in the blood.
