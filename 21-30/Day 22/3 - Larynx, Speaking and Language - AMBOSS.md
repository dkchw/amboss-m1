# Larynx, Speaking and Language
## Summary

The larynx is a cartilaginous connection piece or connecting organ between the trachea and the pharyngeal cavity. Its central functions are the separation of the air from the food pathway (protective function) as well as the production of voice (phonation function), which enables speech. Together with hearing, speaking is one of the most important means of communication for humans.

The skeleton of the larynx consists of several cartilages that are interconnected by muscles and ligaments. Two of these ligaments run across the laryngeal tube and form the glottis. Breathing, whispering, and speaking are each associated with specific positions of the glottis. However, the sounds produced in the larynx must first be reshaped in the nasal-pharyngeal area in order to create intelligible speech sounds.
## Macroscopic Anatomy of the Larynx (Larynx)

The larynx (voice box) is a mucous membrane tube that is kept open by cartilage plates. It connects the trachea to the pharyngeal cavity and consists of cartilaginous parts that are connected by joints. These can be moved by specialized muscles to narrow or widen the vocal slit for phonation. From the outside, a part of the so-called thyroid cartilage is visible as a prominent projection (commonly known as the Adam's apple).

### Profile

- Components and Functions
    - Cartilage
        - Cartilage of the Schild and Ring: Extend the tracheal cartilage cranially.
        - Articular cartilage and vocal fold cartilage: Form the movable suspension of the vocal cords
        - Epiglottis: Serves to close the larynx during swallowing
    - Muscles: Move the cartilage parts during phonation and swallowing
    - Bands: Sound production and stabilization of the larynx
- Location: Between the hypopharynx and the trachea
## Cartilage and Joints

The framework of the larynx consists of various cartilage plates that are connected to each other by joints. The joints allow for even slight rotational and tilting movements of the cartilage. In addition to the width and tension of the glottis, this also influences the shape of the entrance to the larynx.

### Cartilage

One distinguishes four large cartilages that form the laryngeal skeleton. Except for the epiglottis, which is made of elastic cartilage, all parts of the laryngeal skeleton are shaped from hyaline cartilage.

#### Epiglottis (Cartilage epiglottica, Epiglottis)

- Form: Cartilage plate that resembles a bicycle saddle/table tennis racket
- Location and structure: Ventrally, the tip (petiolus) is attached to the inner side of the thyroid cartilage, in front of which lies a larger adipose body (corpus adiposum preepiglotticum).
- Function: Aspiration protection: Swallowing act → Lifting of the larynx → Pressure of the epiglottis against the ventrally positioned adipose body (counter support) → Closure of the laryngeal entrance

#### Thyroid cartilage (Cartilago thyroidea)

- Shape: Shield-shaped
- Location and structure: Two plates that are connected at an angle in the middle.
    - Ventral: Laryngeal prominence (upper edge)
    - Dorsal: The superior and inferior cornua form the attachment points for ligaments.
- Function: Largest cartilage of the laryngeal skeleton, attachment point for muscles and ligaments

#### Cricoid cartilage (Cartilago cricoidea)

- Form: Signet ring-shaped
- Location and Structure
    - Dorsal: Cricoid cartilage plate (Lamina of the cricoid cartilage)
    - Craniodorsal: Articulation surface for the arytenoid cartilage (Facies articularis arytaenoidea)
    - Lateral: Joint surface for thyroid cartilage (Facies articularis thyroideae)
    - Ventral: Arch (Arcus cartilaginis cricoideae)
- Function: Basis of the laryngeal skeleton and connecting element to the thyroid cartilage and the arytenoid cartilages.

#### Arytenoid cartilage (Cartilago arytaenoidea)

- Form: Resembles a pyramid with three sides
- Location and structure: Arranged in pairs, resting on both sides of the ring cartilage (at the articular surface of the arytenoid).
    - The body has two processes: Proc. muscularis and Proc. vocalis
    - Apex (Apex) with corniculate cartilage (Cartilago corniculata)
- Function: Regulate the width of the glottis

### Joints

Through two joints, the width and position of the glottis are regulated.

|Joint|Joint Type|Connection|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cricothyroid joint|Hinge joint|Between the inferior cornu of the thyroid cartilage and the posterior lateral surface of the cricoid cartilage|Regulates the length and tension of the vocal cords|
|Cricoarytenoid joint|Roll-gliding joint|Between the base of the arytenoid cartilage and the upper edge of the cricoid cartilage plate (articular surface of the arytenoid)|Allows for the widening or narrowing of the glottis|
## Bands and Vocal Slits

### Bands and Membranes

The ligaments and membranes of the larynx hold the cartilage together. Of particular importance are the vocal cords, which shape the glottis and serve the production of sound.

#### Inner Connective Tissue Apparatus

##### Vocal Cords (Ligg. vocalia)

- Fine structure: Paired arrangement, consisting of elastic fibers
- Course: Between the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages and the inner surface of the thyroid cartilage.
- Function
    - Form with the M. vocalis the glottis → Phonation
    - Influence the pitch through length and tension → The higher the tension, the higher the tone frequency

##### Median cricothyroid ligament (Conical ligament)

- Fine structure: Consists of elastic fibers
- Course: From the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage to the arch of the cricoid cartilage, it extends cranially and dorsally into the elastic cone.

##### Conus elasticus

- Fine structure: Connective tissue with elastic fibers, shape dependent on the position of the vocal cords.
- Course: From the inner side of the ring cartilage to the vocal cord

##### Quadrangular membrane

- Precision engineering
    - Connective tissue with partially embedded elastic fibers
    - The lower edge is reinforced on both sides and shapes the pocket ligaments (Ligg. vestibularia)
- Course: Between the epiglottis, vestibular folds, and the arytenoid cartilages

#### External connective tissue apparatus

##### Thyrohyoid membrane

- Fine structure: Connective tissue with elastic fibers
- Course: Connects the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage with the hyoid bone
- Function: Transfers displacements of the hyoid bone to the thyroid cartilage
- Special feature: Has openings on both sides for the A. and V. laryngea superior and the R. internus of the N. laryngeus superior (from N. vagus)

> [!NOTE] Koniotomy
> In the case of life-threatening shortness of breath (such as in glottic edema), a cricothyrotomy may be performed as a last resort in the event of falling saturation or unsuccessful intubation attempts. In this procedure, an artificial airway is created by first cutting through the skin and subcutaneous fat tissue, then the superficial and middle cervical fascia, as well as the slightly deeper median cricothyroid ligament (also known as the conical ligament), and subsequently inserting a cannula or tube into the trachea.

### Glottis

- Definition: Slit-like space between the two vocal cords (which contain the vocal folds), whose width determines the volume of the voice.
- Sections
    - Vocal fold share (Pars intermembranacea)
        - Anterior ⅔ of the glottis
        - Proportion before the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilage
        - Limited by the vocal folds
    - Cartilage component (Pars intercartilaginea)
        - Posterior third of the glottis
        - Between both cartilage pads
- Positions of the glottis
    - Breathing position
        - Position of the arytenoid cartilage: Vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilage are rotated outward → Vocal cord portion and arytenoid cartilage portion of the glottis are opened.
        - Result: Glottis wide and relaxed → Air can flow freely through.
        - Dominant muscle: M. cricoarytenoideus posterior
    - Phonation position
        - Position of the arytenoid cartilage: Arytenoid cartilage angled inward → Vocal cord portion and arytenoid cartilage portion of the glottis are in contact with each other → Glottis loosely closed and tense
        - Result: Airflow causes the vocal cords and thus the air to vibrate → voice production (phonation)
        - Dominant muscles: M. thyroarytaenoideus (+ M. vocalis), M. arytaenoideus transversus, M. cricothyroideus
    - Whisper position
        - Position of the arytenoid cartilage: Arytenoid cartilage portion is open, vocal cord portion is closed.
        - Result: Phonation cannot take place; voice production occurs only through articulation in the oral-pharyngeal cavity.
        - Dominant muscle: M. cricoarytenoideus lateralis
## Muscles

The fine-tuning of laryngeal movements is performed by small skeletal muscles known as laryngeal muscles. A distinction is made between an anatomical and a functional classification.

1. Anatomical classification (according to location and innervation)
    - External laryngeal muscles
        - Muscle: M. cricothyroid
        - Innervation: Superior laryngeal nerve (external branch)
    - Intrinsic laryngeal muscles
        - Muscles: All other laryngeal muscles
        - Innervation: N. laryngeus inferior (Only from the N. laryngeus recurrens)
2. Functional classification: Depending on their function, the laryngeal muscles are additionally classified as tensor or relaxer muscles.
    - Control muscles: Change the position of the control cartilages
    - Tensing muscles: Change the tension of the vocal cords

> [!NOTE]
> The M. cricothyroideus is the only external (!) laryngeal muscle and is the only muscle innervated by the R. externus of the N. laryngeus superior and not by the N. laryngeus inferior!

> [!NOTE] Recurrent paresis
> A damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve can lead to what's known as recurrent nerve paralysis (of which the cricothyroid muscle, innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve, is naturally not affected). In the case of unilateral recurrent nerve paralysis, all internal laryngeal muscles on that side are affected, including both the vocal cord opener (posterior cricoarytenoid muscle) and the vocal cord closers (lateral cricoarytenoid muscle, oblique and transverse arytenoid muscles). As a result, the ipsilateral vocal cord on the affected side stands still, usually in a paramedian or median position. Due to the incomplete closure of the vocal cords in phonation position, hoarseness occurs; however, the contralateral movable vocal cord allows for unobstructed breathing. In contrast, bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis – depending on the position of the vocal cords – can lead to inspiratory stridor and severe shortness of breath, since now both sides have lost the only vocal cord opener (the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle, also called "Posticus").

## Laryngeal Fractures

Two mucosal folds divide the interior of the larynx into three levels. This classification allows for an accurate description of the laryngeal mucosa.

- Mucosal folds
    - Folds of the vestibule (Plicae vestibulares)
        - Contain the pocket straps
        - The two opposing pocket folds form the rima vestibularis.
    - Vocal folds (vocal cords, plicae vocales): They are located just below the ventricular folds.
        - Contain the vocal cords
            - Reinke's Space: Loose connective tissue between the epithelium of the vocal folds and the vocal cords
        - Between the vocal folds is the glottic slit (Rima glottidis)
- Laryngeal layers
    1. Supraglottic space (vestibule of the larynx): Between the laryngeal entrance (aditus laryngis) and the ventricular folds.
    2. Transglottic Space
        - Between pocket folds and vocal folds
        - Has a lateral bulge: Laryngeal ventricle (Morgagni pouch)
            - Forms a resonating body
            - The wall contains mixed glands to moisten the vocal cords
    3. Subglottic space: From the vocal folds to the beginning of the trachea

> [!NOTE]
> The so-called Reinke's edema is usually a bilateral edematous swelling of the vocal cords in the Reinke space, that is, between the epithelium and the vocal ligament. It occurs particularly in middle-aged women. The most common risk factors include smoking (in >90%) and vocal cord overuse. A deep, hoarse voice is a common symptom; rarely, there may also be shortness of breath with inspiratory stridor. In laryngoscopy, a thick, cushion-like swelling of the vocal cords is observed.

> [!NOTE] Laryngocele
> A laryngocele is an outpouching of the laryngeal ventricle. It can be acquired or congenital and may manifest as dysphonia (voice disorder) or dyspnea (shortness of breath).

## Microscopic Anatomy of the Larynx

- Laryngeal mucosa
    - Epithelial
        - Multilayered, non-keratinized squamous epithelium: Laryngeal entrance, vocal cords
        - Multilayered ciliated epithelium (respiratory epithelium): All other areas.
            - Laryngeal glands: Mucous glands that are embedded in the ciliated epithelium and moisturize it.
    - Lamina propria (beneath the epithelium)
        - Connective tissue and a layer of elastic fibers (so-called fibroelastic membrane)
        - Exception: In the area of the vocal cords, the lamina propria is particularly loosely structured. Here, glands and lymphatic tissue are absent.

> [!NOTE]
> The epiglottis shields the trachea from the esophagus. Therefore, the multilayered, non-keratinized squamous epithelium of the pharynx transitions into the pseudostratified, respiratory ciliated epithelium of the larynx here!

## Speak

The formation of voice basically occurs in the larynx and is called phonation. The sounds produced here still differ significantly from the intelligible speech sounds. Only the subsequent articulation in the oral-pharyngeal cavity shapes the speech sounds we know.

### Phonation (Voice Formation)

As phonation is referred to the voice production in the larynx. Voiced sounds occur when the vocal cords are set into vibration by the air flowing through them. The width and tension of the glottis are controlled by the laryngeal muscles and the airflow. This affects pitch and volume.

- Physical background of phonation (In order to understand how voice production occurs, the Bernoulli effect will first be explained.)
    - Bernoulli Effect (so-called suction effect): Describes the relationship between flow velocity and pressure within a flow system.
        - The product of flow velocity and pressure is constant
        - Consequently, an increase in speed is accompanied by a drop in pressure.
- Process of the phonation cycle
    1. Phonation position of the glottis
        - Glottis closed, vocal cords slightly tense (tension of the vocal cord muscles > pressure below the glottis)
    2. Forced Exhalation
        - The airflow during expiration increases the pressure below the glottis (subglottic pressure) until it is sufficient to open the vocal cords (tension of the vocal cord muscles < subglottic pressure)
    3. Air flows through the glottis and opens it a little.
        - As the airway within the glottis is narrowed, the flow velocity in this area increases.
    4. Bernoulli Effect
        - The fast airflow through the glottis creates a drop in pressure between both vocal cords → Vocal bands are pulled together (due to the drop in pressure)
    5. The glottis is closed again → Cycle begins anew
- Result: Glottis closes and opens alternately → Periodic vibrations of the vocal cords → Formation of phonation sound (perceived as voice)
- Pitch: Is influenced by the length and tension of the vocal cords.
- Volume: Is influenced by the generated expiratory pressure

> [!NOTE]
> The subglottic pressure fluctuates depending on the state of the glottis (open or closed) and is important for voice production!

### Process of Articulation (Voice Formation)

The further shaping of sounds is called articulation. It takes place in the mouth-throat area, which forms a so-called resonance space. Depending on the position, e.g., of the tongue or lips, different speech elements are formed from the sounds (which arise from phonation).

- Description of the process
    - The oral-pharyngeal cavity forms a resonant space.
    - The resonance chamber has different resonance properties depending on its shape.
        - Background knowledge
            - The oral-pharyngeal space has a characteristic resonant frequency depending on its shape.
            - The phonation sound, in turn, contains a spectrum of different partial tones (so-called overtones)
            - Depending on the shape of the resonance chamber, the various partial tones are either amplified or diminished.
                - Harmonics are amplified when they approximately coincide with the natural frequency of the resonance chamber.
                - Overtones are dampened when they differ from the natural frequency of the resonance chamber.
            - Result: The mouth-pharyngeal space filters the phonation sound and thus shapes the intelligible speech sounds.
- Result: Emergence of different language elements (phonemes)
    - Vowels (Sound sounds): Vibrations of the air column are only slightly altered by the articulation process.
    - Consonants (sound sounds): Vibrations of the air column are significantly altered by the articulation process.

> [!NOTE]
> The articulation takes place in the mouth-throat area and shapes intelligible speech sounds!

## Language

In contrast to the term "speaking" – which refers to the actual speaking process – "language" describes a theoretical construct that encompasses the knowledge repository of vocabulary, grammar, and language comprehension. The language regions of the cortex include the primary and secondary auditory cortex as well as the sensory and motor language centers. The auditory pathway ends in the primary auditory cortex, from where the information is directed to the secondary auditory cortex and to the sensory language center. Here, the heard information enters consciousness and is understood. The motor language center in the lower frontal lobe is responsible for the speech motor response.

### Primary Auditory Cortex

- Function: Audio signals are perceived without interpretation.
- Localization: Transverse temporal gyri (Heschl's gyrus/Area 41 according to Brodmann)
- Afferents: Auditory pathway
- Structuring: Fibers terminate in tonotopic arrangement
- Efferenzen: Projecting (mainly) into the secondary auditory cortex

### Secondary Auditory Cortex and Sensory Language Center (Wernicke Area)

- Main function: Hearing signals are interpreted, the basis of language comprehension
- Localization
    - Secondary auditory cortex (Brodmann areas 42 and 22): Surrounds the primary auditory cortex in the transverse temporal gyrus.
    - Sensory language center (superior temporal gyrus occipital of Area 22): Usually located in the so-called dominant hemisphere.
- Afferents: Primary auditory cortex and angular gyrus (sends fibers from the secondary visual cortex)
- Efferenzen
    - Cortical association areas for further processing
    - Motor Speech Center (Broca Area)

### Motor Speech Center (Broca Area) [1][2]

- Function: Speech motor skills
- Localization: Inferior frontal gyrus in the frontal lobe (usually on the dominant hemisphere)
- Afferents: Sensory language center (Wernicke area)
- Efferents: For the initiation and coordination of the complex speech process, the motor speech center sends efferent fibers to other brain areas:
    - Basal ganglia
    - Cerebellum
    - Motokortex

> [!NOTE]
> The sensory language center is important for language comprehension. The motor language center is important for motor speech production!

> [!NOTE]
> motor - Broca - frontal and sensory - Wernicke - temporal

### Circuits

To better understand the central processing of language, two circuits are mentioned as examples here:

- Understanding and responding: Acoustic stimulus → Auditory pathway → Primary auditory cortex → Secondary auditory cortex → Motor speech center → Initiation of speech through:
    - Motocortex (direct)
    - Basal ganglia → Thalamus → Motor cortex
    - Cerebellum → Thalamus → Motor Cortex
- Reading: Visual stimuli → Visual pathway → Primary visual cortex → Secondary visual cortex → Angular gyrus → Sensory language center → Motor language center → Initiation of language through:
    - Motocortex (direct)
    - Basal ganglia → Thalamus → Motor cortex
    - Cerebellum → Thalamus → Motor Cortex

### Aphasia

Aphasia is a language disorder that is usually due to an acquired damage to neural structures (e.g., from a stroke). Depending on the location of the lesion, different forms of aphasia are distinguished:

|Aphasia|   |Location of Lesion|Main Symptoms|
|---|---|---|---|
|Motor Aphasía (Broca's Aphasía)|   |- Motor Speech Center (Broca's Area, in the Frontal Lobe)|- Speech Production↓: Expressive language disorder with telegraphic, agrammatical speech and delayed speech flow<br>- Language comprehension usually intact|
|Sensory Aphasia (Wernicke's Aphasia)|   |- Sensory Language Center (Wernicke's Area, in the Temporal Lobe)|- Language comprehension↓<br>    - Fluent speech without meaningful cohesion<br>    - Frequent neologisms<br>    - Paraphasias (word changes)<br>        - Phonemic paraphasias (e.g., Lömfel instead of Löffel)<br>        - Semantic paraphasias (e.g., Gabel instead of Löffel)|
|Global Aphasia|   |- Motor Speech Center (Broca Area)<br>- Sensory Speech Center (Wernicke Area)<br>- Arcuate Fasciculus: Fiber connection between motor speech center and sensory speech center|- Speech production and comprehension significantly reduced|
## Review Questions on the Chapter Larynx, Speaking, and Language
### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Larynx

What is meant by a coniotomy and which anatomical structures are cut during this procedure?
- In cases of acute risk of suffocation due to a closure of the glottis or an obstruction of the airways above the larynx, an emergency procedure called a coniotomy can be performed. In this procedure, an artificial airway is created by making an incision between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage of the larynx. Initially, the skin, subcutaneous fat tissue, the superficial and middle layers of the cervical fascia, and finally the median cricothyroid ligament (also called the conic ligament) are cut.

Describe the anatomical classification of the M. cricothyroideus based on its location and innervation!
- The M. cricothyroideus is the only external muscle of the larynx. It extends from the ventrolateral surface of the cricoid cartilage on both sides to the lower border and inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage. It is the only laryngeal muscle innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve (through its motor external branch), whereas all other laryngeal muscles are supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve (terminal branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve).

Which two laryngeal muscles cause a narrowing of the intercartilaginous part of the glottis by altering the position of the arytenoid cartilages?
- The intercartilaginous part refers to the posterior portion of the glottis located between both arytenoid cartilages. Among the arytenoid muscles that lead to a narrowing or closure of the intercartilaginous part are, besides the oblique arytenoid muscle, also the unpaired transverse arytenoid muscle.

Describe the anatomical classification of the M. cricoarytaenoideus posterior (also known as Postikus) according to its position and innervation! How does it functionally differ from all other laryngeal muscles?
- The M. cricoarytaenoideus posterior extends bilaterally from the posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage to the muscular process of the arytenoid cartilage and is innervated, like the other intrinsic laryngeal muscles, by the inferior laryngeal nerve (terminal branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve). It is of particular importance because it is the only laryngeal muscle responsible for opening the entire glottis.

What are the consequences of a unilateral and a bilateral injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve?
- All intrinsic laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (or its terminal branch, the inferior laryngeal nerve), including the M. cricoarytaenoideus posterior (also known as "Postikus"), the only opener of the glottis. If the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged unilaterally, for example during thyroid surgery, it leads to paralysis of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles on the ipsilateral side. The vocal cord of the affected side remains in a paramedian position, resulting in permanent hoarseness of the patient. In the case of bilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves, both vocal cords remain in the paramedian position, causing respiratory distress. In emergency cases, this may require a tracheostomy.

Which nerves are responsible for the sensory innervation of the larynx?
- The sensory innervation of the cranial portion of the larynx up to the vocal folds is provided by the purely sensory internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. The caudal portion of the larynx is supplied by the inferior laryngeal nerve.

### Language

In which areas of the brain are the primary auditory cortex, the sensory, and the motor language center located?
- The primary auditory cortex is located in the area of the transverse temporal gyri of the temporal lobes. Adjacent to it in the area of the superior temporal gyrus is the sensory language center (mostly in the dominant hemisphere). The motor language center, on the other hand, is located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe (also mostly in the dominant hemisphere).

What symptoms can be expected in a patient with sensory aphasia?
- Sensory aphasia (Wernicke's aphasia) is a disorder of language comprehension that occurs with damage to the sensory language center (Wernicke's area). Since language production remains intact, patients display a fluent flow of speech that lacks meaningful content. The use of neologisms (newly coined words) and paraphasias (word substitutions) is common.

What symptoms can be expected in a patient with motor aphasia?
- Motor aphasia (Broca's aphasia) is a disorder of speech production that occurs with damage to the motor language center (Broca's area). It results in impaired speech motor function with reduced spontaneous speech in a telegram-like, agrammatical style. Language comprehension remains intact.
