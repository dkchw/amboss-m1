# Structure and Function of Blood Vessels
## Summary

The vessels of the human body have two fundamental tasks: On one hand, they are supposed to transport blood from the heart to the organs and back; on the other hand, they facilitate the exchange of substances between the cells and the blood in the organs. The larger vessels, such as arteries and veins, primarily serve to transport the blood. They branch out into a multitude of small capillaries and venules (so-called terminal circulation) as soon as they reach an organ. This is where the actual exchange of substances takes place.

These various functions are also reflected in a different structure of the vessels: Veins and arteries show a fundamentally similar three-layer structure (intima, media, adventitia) as transport vessels, which serves the safe and loss-free transport of blood. In contrast, the vessels of the terminal circulation are intended to allow for material exchange, so their wall is only single-layered and mostly particularly permeable.

The material exchange in the end stream must occur in both directions, i.e., from the capillary to the tissue and from the tissue to the capillary. During the course of the material exchange, there is therefore a change in the forces acting between the capillary and the tissue. The so-called Starling formula contrasts these forces in order to determine, on the one hand, the filtered volume and, on the other hand, its direction of flow (out of or into the blood vessel).
## Circulation Elements

The heart is the engine of the pulmonary and systemic circulation, the vessels are the transport and exchange system. The capillaries are the finest branches of this transport system and serve the purpose of material exchange. Since the material exchange leads to the exit of fluid into the tissue, a second transport system (the lymphatic system) is needed to return this tissue fluid to the bloodstream.

### Anatomical Components of the Circulatory System

1. Heart: Each chamber of the heart serves as the engine of "its" circulation.
2. Blood vessels
    1. Arteries
        - Function: Transporting arterial (oxygen-rich) blood away from the heart
        - Course: Gradually decrease in size (Arteries → Arterioles → Metarterioles → Capillaries)
        - Special feature: Arterioles act as so-called resistance vessels
    2. Blood capillaries
        - Function: Facilitate gas and substance exchange
        - Course: Transition into venules (Capillary → Venule)
        - Special feature: Extremely large cross-sectional area with low flow velocity and short diffusion distance
    3. Veins
        - Function: Transporting the venous (oxygen-poor) blood from the periphery to the heart
        - Course: Forming after the capillary bed → Becoming progressively larger (→ Capillary → Venule → Vein → Vena cava)
        - Special feature: Can store a large blood volume (therefore referred to as so-called capacitance vessels)
3. Lymphatic Vessels
    - Function: Serve among other things to drain fluid from the tissue
    - Course: Lymph vessels gradually enlarge and ultimately drain into the venous system (→ venous angle → superior vena cava) → No independent circulation

### Functional Classification of Vascular Sections

Depending on their function, the vascular sections can be assigned to a transport or an exchange system.

| **Definition**       | **Description**                                                                                    | **Structure**                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transport system** | Vessel section that primarily serves to transport, store blood volume, and regulate blood pressure | Consists of large vessels (mainly arteries and veins)     |
| **Exchange system**  | Circuit section responsible for the exchange of substances between tissues and blood               | Consists mainly of capillaries and post-capillary venules |
## Construction of Large Vessels

All major blood vessels are similarly structured and consist of three layers (from the inside out): intima, media, and adventitia. The exact composition of these vascular layers varies depending on the specific function of the vessel. Arteries, for example, have a very muscular media to withstand the high arterial blood pressure. Veins only need to resist the low venous blood pressure, which is why their media contains significantly fewer muscles. Due to the sparsely developed muscles, veins have a larger lumen than arteries and are capable of storing larger amounts of blood.

> [!NOTE]
> Large vessels exhibit a three-layer structure, whereas very small vessels like capillaries and venules consist only of a single layer of endothelial cells!

> [!NOTE] Atherosclerosis
> The term atherosclerosis refers to a pathological change in the walls of arteries that can lead to stiffening and narrowing of the lumen of arteries. The most common form of atherosclerosis is atherosclerosis, in which the vascular intima is pathologically altered. The starting point is usually an endothelial injury that leads to the deposition of circulating lipids (e.g., LDL) in the blood. This causes inflammatory cells to migrate from the blood and muscle cells from the vascular media into the subendothelial stratum of the intima. The interplay of local inflammation, progressive lipid deposition, and the production of extracellular matrix by the migrated muscle cells leads to the formation of atheromatous plaques in the vascular intima. These protrude into the vascular lumen and narrow it. This narrowing of the lumen alone can already cause a decreased perfusion of the subsequent tissue due to the significantly increased vascular resistance (Hagen-Poiseuille law). This can lead to the development of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD). Additionally, several layers of platelet thrombi can deposit on the atheromatous plaque, making the plaque less stable. A rupture of the plaque can acutely occlude the vessel. This is, for example, a cause of acute ischemic events such as stroke or heart attack. The main risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis are tobacco consumption, diabetes mellitus, and arterial hypertension.

### Characteristics of Arteries

Arteries are, in contrast to veins, part of the so-called high-pressure system. This means they must withstand arterial blood pressure, which is why they have significantly more smooth muscle than veins.

### Characteristics of Veins

Veins primarily serve to store and transport blood back to the heart. These functions are reflected in their special structure: To store blood, veins have a large lumen and a relatively thin and muscle-poor media. To transport blood only in the direction of the heart, veins have so-called venous valves that function like valves.

|Characteristics of Veins (as opposed to Arteries)|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Structure of the Vessel Wall|Intima|- The internal elastic membrane is usually discontinuous in veins<br>- Contains venous valves|
|Media|- Usually has significantly fewer smooth muscle cells than arteries<br>- The external elastic membrane is absent|
|Adventitia|- May contain smooth muscle cells<br>- Is the thickest wall layer in some veins|
|Function|   |- Storage of blood volume (capacitance vessels)|

> [!NOTE] Varicose veins
> Varicose veins, commonly referred to as "varicose veins," describe expanded and twisted skin veins. The cause is often a combination of genetic predisposition and increased hydrostatic pressure, for example, in the legs during prolonged standing activities. This leads to a gradual expansion of the vein. Once a certain lumen size is reached, the pockets of the venous valves no longer close tightly, so the column of blood is no longer interrupted by a venous valve. This exerts increased hydrostatic pressure on the next lower section of the vein or the lower-lying venous valve. This process can continue slowly and lead to long stretches of venous expansion, in other words, varicose veins. Since blood flow in the large-volume varicose veins is reduced (see continuity law), they are prone to the development of so-called superficial venous thromboses (Virchow's triad). These venous thrombi promote inflammatory reactions of the vein, which is referred to as thrombophlebitis.

### Vascular Mechanics

The relationship between the structure and the requirements of a vessel can be understood through some physical laws. On one hand, the tension in the vessel wall will be examined, and on the other hand, the elasticity of vessels will be highlighted. For example, the high arterial blood pressure generates tension in the walls of arteries (so-called tangential wall tension, see below), which can only withstand due to their thick and muscular wall and their small internal diameter. With a larger internal diameter and the same blood pressure, as in the case of an aneurysm, significantly higher wall tensions arise. Veins, on the other hand, only need to withstand the low venous blood pressure, which is why their walls are thinner and less muscular, and their lumen is larger.

### Transmural pressure and tangential wall tension

When blood is pumped from the heart into the vessels, it creates an internal pressure (Pi) in the vessel. This is countered by the so-called extravascular pressure (Pe), which consists of all the forces acting on the vessel from the outside (e.g., tissue, tight clothing, compression stockings). The difference between these two pressures is referred to as the transmural pressure (Ptm). Normally, the internal pressure of a vessel is significantly higher than the extravascular pressure, which is why the transmural pressure is positive. Therefore, the vessel and its wall are stretched from the inside out. This generates a counterforce in the wall, known as tangential wall tension. If one imagines a longitudinally opened vessel, the transmural pressure acts uniformly on its walls from the inside, causing them to move apart. The tangential wall tension counteracts the transmural pressure and represents the force with which the diverging wall components "hold on" to each other. Similar to the calculation of wall tension in a sphere using Laplace's law, wall tensions in tubes or vessels can also be calculated using a modified formula. The magnitude of the generated wall tension largely depends on the structure and properties of the vessel, such as its volumetric elasticity (see below).

#### Transmural Pressure

- Definition: The transmural pressure (Ptm) is the difference between the pressure within the vessel (Pi) and the pressure exerted on the vessel from the outside (Pe).
- Formula: Ptm = Pi − Pe
    - Units: Ptm/i/e [mmHg]

#### Tangential Wall Stress

- Basic consideration: The transmural pressure is generally positive, such that a vessel is stretched from the inside out, causing the vessel wall parts to move apart and generate an opposing force - the tangential wall stress.
- Definition: Force within the vessel wall that opposes the tendency to stretch apart during dilation and "holds" the vessel wall together.
- Formula (based on Laplace's law) σt = (Ptm × r) / h
    - Units: σt = Tangential wall stress [mmHg]; Ptm = [Transmural pressure [mmHg]; r = Inner radius [cm]; h = Vessel wall thickness [cm]
- Conclusions:
    - Tangential wall stress increases with decreasing vessel wall thickness and increasing transmural pressure and/or inner diameter.
    - The smaller the vessel radius and the thicker the vessel wall, the less tangential wall tension is produced at the same transmural pressure.

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the tangential wall stress, the reason for the different structure of vessels can be understood. Arteries must withstand a high internal pressure, which is why they have a thick vessel wall and a small internal diameter. Veins, on the other hand, only need to withstand a low internal pressure, which is why their diameter is larger and their wall is thinner!

### Elasticity of Vessels

The elasticity is a material property that describes that a body strives to return to its original state after deformation. Organs and vessels of the human body also possess this property to varying degrees. They are differently elastic, depending on whether they are primarily composed of less elastic components (e.g., muscles) or primarily composed of highly elastic components (e.g., elastic fibers).

In medicine, the elasticity of vessels and organs is described in two ways: On one hand, it describes how much the volume of a vessel adjusts to a change in pressure, which is referred to as compliance or distensibility. On the other hand, it describes how the internal pressure changes when the volume decreases or increases, based on the so-called volume elasticity coefficient. Compliance is the reciprocal of the volume elasticity coefficient.

#### Vascular compliance (from English compliance = "yielding")

- Definition: Vascular compliance is a measure of the change in vessel volume with a change in blood pressure (volume elasticity).
- Formula: C = ΔV / ΔP
    - Units: C = Compliance [mL/mmHg]; ΔV = Volume change [mL]; ΔP = Pressure change [mmHg]
- Conclusions
    - The higher the vessel compliance, the easier it is for the vessel volume to increase with a change in pressure (e.g., arteries of the elastic type with a windkessel function) or the lower the pressure change for the same volume.
    - The lower the vessel compliance, the less the vessel volume increases with a change in pressure (e.g., muscular type arteries) or the higher the pressure at the same volume.
- Calculation example: Compliance of the ascending aorta
    - Given: Stroke volume (ΔV = 40 mL) and pressure change (ΔP = 40 mmHg)
    - Sought: Compliance of the ascending aorta
    - Calculation instructions
        - C = ΔV / ΔP
        - C = 40 mL / 40 mmHg
        - C = 1 mL/mmHg

> [!NOTE]
> The vascular compliance is primarily determined by the musculature of a vessel. Especially muscular arterioles exhibit low compliance and are considered resistance vessels. Veins have little smooth muscle, which is why their compliance is up to 200 times greater. They are therefore regarded as capacitance vessels!

#### Coefficient of Volume Elasticity

- Definition: The volume elasticity coefficient of a vessel is a measure of the change in blood pressure that results from a change in the vessel volume. Mathematically, this is the reciprocal of compliance.
- Formula
    - E' = 1 / C
    - E' = ΔP / ΔV
        - Units: E' = volumetric elasticity coefficient [mmHg/mL], C = compliance [mL/mmHg], ΔP = pressure change [mmHg], ΔV = volume change [mL]
- Conclusions
    - The higher the volume elastic modulus (E') of a vessel, the greater the change in its blood pressure (ΔP) with a (blood) volume change (ΔV).
    - The lower the volume elasticity coefficient (E') of a vessel, the less its blood pressure (ΔP) changes with an increase in (blood) volume (ΔV).
- Calculation example: Volume elasticity coefficient of the ascending aorta
    - Given: Stroke volume (ΔV = 40 ml) and pressure change (ΔP = 40 mmHg)
    - Sought: Volume elasticity coefficient of the ascending aorta
    - Calculation instructions
        - E' = ΔP / ΔV
        - E' = 40 mmHg / 40 mL
        - E' = 1 mmHg/mL

> [!NOTE]
> Compliance and the volume elasticity coefficient are two different ways to describe the elasticity of a material or organ. Since the volume elasticity coefficient is the reciprocal of compliance, their values behave oppositely! (e.g., Compliance↑ → Volume elasticity coefficient↓)

## Structure of the final conduction path (capillaries and venules)

The so-called terminal vascular bed consists of capillaries and venules and is responsible for the exchange of substances between the blood and the tissue. Since the organs have different requirements for substance exchange, the structure of the capillaries and venules varies slightly in the organs. The blood flow in the terminal vascular bed is influenced, among other things, by specialized vascular structures, such as, for example, occlusive arteries.

### The Final Current Track

- Definition: Circuit section responsible for material exchange
- Structure: Mainly consists of precapillary arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules.
- Distribution density of capillaries: The number of capillaries per area varies depending on the region/organ.
- Blood flow in the terminal vascular bed: Strongly regulated → At any given time, only about ⅓ of the capillaries and venules are perfused.

### Common Wall Structure of Capillaries

Capillaries are distinguished from larger vessels by only a single wall layer separating them from the surrounding environment. The fundamental structure is the same in all capillaries, while the specific structure depends on which organ the capillary is located in and what specific function it needs to fulfill.

- Shared wall layers (from inside to outside)
    1. Endothelial cells (one layer)
    2. Pericytes
        - They lie on the endothelium from the outside and surround it with their extensions as a discontinuous wall.
        - Contractility at the beginning and end of a capillary segment → Regulation of vessel diameter
        - The basement membrane of the pericytes partially merges with the basement membrane of the endothelial cells.
    3. Basement membrane

### Capillary Types

There are three different types of capillaries: continuous, fenestrated, and discontinuous capillaries. In the organs, one type of capillary may be found more frequently than the others, depending on the requirements.

|Capillary Types|Occurrence|Special Structure|Transport Properties|
|---|---|---|---|
|Continuous capillaries|- Predominant capillary type in most organs|- Continuous endothelium forms a complete or nearly closed "tube" with irregular gaps|- Irregular gaps only allow partial paracellular transport|
|Fenestrated Capillaries|- Organs with high secretion or absorption capacity such as the small intestine, kidney, and endocrine glands|- Fenestrated endothelium has windows or pores<br>- Windows are covered by a diaphragm with many negative charges|- Passage of water and hydrophilic molecules is possible<br>- Passage of plasma proteins is hindered due to their negative charge|
|Discontinuous capillaries / sinusoids|- E.g. liver, bone marrow, placenta (and spleen)|- Discontinuous endothelium has groups of particularly large transcellular pores, some even without diaphragm and basement membrane (e.g. liver sinusoids)|- Passage of macromolecules possible|

> [!NOTE]
> The continuous capillaries of the brain exhibit particularly numerous and dense tight junctions, so that the paracellular transport pathway is closed. In this way, the endothelium is significantly involved in the blood-brain barrier!

### Venolen

- Definition: Venous vessels that are located between the capillaries and the venous system.
- Structure: Continuously changes over the course
    1. Postcapillary venules: Structure resembles that of capillaries (→ High permeability → Substance exchange)
    2. The collecting venules: structure may already resemble larger blood vessels (three-layered)
- Functionally unique venules: High endothelial venules possess specific surface molecules for the recognition of leukocytes → Site of leukocyte migration into or out of lymphatic organs.
### Vascular Structures for Blood Flow Regulation

Besides "global" mechanisms of blood flow regulation, such as the alteration of the total blood volume (Gauer-Henry reflex), there are local vascular structures involved in the regulation of blood flow to the downstream organ. The fundamental principle is similar across all structures: contraction of smooth vascular muscle to increase flow resistance. Depending on the structure, this either increases blood flow through a capillary bed (arteriovenous anastomosis) or decreases it (precapillary sphincter).

|Vascular Structures|Definition|Function|Special Occurrence|

## Function: Material Exchange

The terminal circulation is the part of the circuit responsible for material exchange. It mainly consists of capillaries and venules. Here, the blood flows very slowly due to the enormous vessel cross-section, in order to ensure optimal material exchange. Whether there is filtration or reabsorption of fluid into or out of the capillary area significantly depends on blood pressure.

### Material exchange in the final flow path

#### General

The blood is a suspension of various "particles" or colloids dissolved in it. When it is pushed through a capillary by blood pressure, two main forces act on the fluid in the capillaries: the colloidosmotic and the hydrostatic pressure. The capillary wall separates the inside of the capillary from the surrounding tissue like a semipermeable membrane. The colloidosmotic and hydrostatic pressures on both sides of the capillary wall therefore act against each other. The inward and outward acting forces are combined into the so-called effective filtration pressure.

- Fundamental mechanism: The exchange of various substances in the final flow path is primarily based on diffusion, and depending on the substance, also on filtration and reabsorption.
- Effective filtration pressure: Peff = (PKap + πGew − PGew − πKap)
    - Units: Peff = Effective filtration pressure mmHg]; PKap = [Hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries mmHg]; PGew = [Hydrostatic pressure in the tissue/interstitium mmHg]; πKap = [Colloid osmotic pressure in the capillaries mmHg]; πGew = [Colloid osmotic pressure in the tissue/interstitium [mmHg]
    - Determination of the flow direction during material exchange
        - Filtration when: (PKap + πGew) > (PGew + πKap)
        - Reabsorption in: (PKap + πGew) < (PGew + πKap)

> [!NOTE]
> The sign of the effective filtration pressure indicates the direction of flow during substance exchange. If the sign of the effective filtration pressure is positive, fluid is filtered from the vessel into the tissue. If the sign is negative, fluid is reabsorbed from the tissue into the vessel!

#### Determination of Filtration Volume Using the Starling Formula

With the Starling equation, the filtration volume per unit of time is calculated based on the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures on both sides of the capillary endothelium. Under physiological conditions, the varying hydrostatic blood pressure in the capillary along its course plays the most significant role.

- Starling's filtration formula: V = Peff × K = (PKap + πGew − PGew − πKap) × K
    - Units: V = filtered volume per minute [l/min]; Peff = [Effective filtration pressure mmHg]; PKap = [Hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries mmHg]; PInt = [Hydrostatic pressure in the tissue/interstitium mmHg]; πKap = [Colloid osmotic pressure in the capillaries mmHg]; πInt = [Colloid osmotic pressure in the tissue/interstitium mmHg]; K = filtration coefficient
- Simplifications under physiological conditions
    - Hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (PKap) decreases due to the filtration of fluid along the capillary.
    - Colloid osmotic pressure in the capillaries (πCap) remains approximately constant throughout the capillaries (at ∼ 25mmHg)
    - Hydrostatic pressure (PGew) and colloidosmotic pressure (πGew) in the tissue/interstitium are negligibly low.
- Conclusions
    - Filtration volume and flow direction (Filtration vs. Reabsorption) primarily depend on the hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (PKap)
    - Change of flow direction in the course of the capillary, due to the decrease of hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (PKap)
        - Hydrostatic pressure in the arterial limb of the terminal pathway is high (∼30 mmHg) → Filtration
        - Hydrostatic pressure in the venous limb of the end circulation is low (∼15 mmHg) → reabsorption

> [!NOTE]
> In the course of substance exchange in the efferent pathway, only 90% of the filtered fluid is reabsorbed. The remaining 10% of fluid is transported out of the tissue via the lymphatic system and returned to the venous vascular system!

#### Special Features of Material Exchange

The capillary endothelium is variably permeable to liquids, water-soluble, and fat-soluble substances. Fat-soluble substances can diffuse transcellularly across the entire surface of the lipid membrane of the endothelium. In contrast, liquids and water-soluble substances cannot freely diffuse through the lipid membrane of the endothelial cells. They require gaps, pores, and transporters.

- Liquids: In addition to diffusion, liquids are also filtered and reabsorbed in a steady state → Calculation of the filtration/reabsorption volume per time using the Starling formula
- Fat-soluble substances: Can diffuse through the entire endothelial surface (transcellularly) (simple diffusion) → Transport rate mainly depends on blood flow (so-called perfusion-limited transport)
- Water-soluble substances: Require pores, intercellular spaces, and/or transporters (facilitated diffusion) → The transport rate depends, among other factors, on the size of the pores, the number of transporters, and the molecular size of the substance to be transported → An increase in blood flow does not lead to an increased transport rate for substances that cannot freely diffuse (so-called diffusion-limited transport)

> [!NOTE] Basics of Edema Formation
> Pathological water retention in the tissues is referred to as edema and occurs either due to an imbalance of filtration and reabsorption during the substance exchange or due to a disturbed transport of lymph.
> 
> - Definition of edema: Pathological accumulation of water in the tissue
> - Possible causes
>     1. Discrepancy between filtration and reabsorption
>     2.  1. Increase in hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries (PKap)
>     3.  2. Decrease in colloid osmotic pressure in the capillaries (πCap)
>     4.  3. Increase in the permeability of the capillaries (K)
>     5. Disruption of lymphatic drainage

> [!NOTE] Compression stockings
> In the context of diseases (e.g., chronic venous insufficiency), pathological fluid accumulation in the tissue (edema) of the legs can occur. To counteract this increased leakage of fluid into the tissue, the pressures that push/pull the fluid into the capillaries (PGew and πKap) need to be increased. This means that the disturbed equilibrium of filtration and reabsorption must be shifted in favor of reabsorption. Since the colloid osmotic pressure in the capillaries is difficult to change, therapeutically, the tissue pressure (PGew) is increased. This is usually achieved by wearing very tight "compression stockings," which exert strong pressure on the tissue from the outside and thereby increase the tissue pressure (PGew).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Structure and Function of Blood Vessels
### Circulation Elements

What is the function of the arterial vessels?
- The arterial vessels transport blood away from the heart and contain oxygen-rich blood, except for the pulmonary artery. The arterioles and small arteries also serve as so-called "resistance vessels" and account for about half of the total peripheral resistance.

Describe the structure and function of the capillaries!
- The capillaries are the smallest arterial blood vessels of the circulation and have an extremely high cross-sectional area due to their strong branching. This serves to facilitate the gas and substance exchange that takes place here between blood and tissue and reduces the flow velocity. After the substance exchange, the capillaries transition into venules.

### Construction of Large Vessels

First, describe the basic wall structure of the large vessels and then name the differences between arteries and veins!
- All large vessels consist of three layers (from inside to outside: intima, media, and adventitia), whose exact composition varies depending on the specific function of the vessel. The intima can be further divided into endothelium, subendothelial layer, and internal elastic membrane. The media mainly contains smooth muscle, and the connective tissue adventitia contains the supply structures of the blood vessels (nerves, lymphatic and blood vessels (vasa vasorum)). Arteries are characterized especially by a strong development of the muscle layer of the media, with which they can withstand the high arterial blood pressure. Since veins, among other things, serve as blood storage, they have a large lumen and a relatively thin, muscle-poor media. The internal elastic membrane of the intima is usually discontinuous in veins and contains venous valves, and the adventitia is the thickest wall layer in some veins.

What types of arteries do you know and where do they each occur?
- Arteries can be divided into two types based on their wall structure: arteries near the heart (aorta, pulmonary trunk and their large branches) contain primarily elastic fibers in the tunica media and are therefore referred to as elastic-type arteries. The arteries of the muscular type belong to the vessels farther from the heart. Their media consists mainly of smooth muscle, allowing them to regulate their lumen through changes in vascular tone.

Which signaling molecule mediates the formation of new vascular endothelium?
- The formation of new vascular endothelium (angiogenesis) is primarily mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This binds to the VEGF receptor of the intima and thereby promotes proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.

### Structure of the final conduction path (capillaries and venules)

What are the three types of capillaries and where do they typically occur?
- Capillaries can be divided based on the permeability of their vascular endothelium into continuous, fenestrated, and discontinuous capillaries. Continuous capillaries are the predominant type in most organs, with particularly many and dense tight junctions in the brain (blood-brain barrier). Fenestrated capillaries are found in organs with high secretion or absorption capacity (e.g., kidney, small intestine). Discontinuous capillaries, also called sinusoids, are found for example in the liver and spleen.

### Function: Material Exchange

What does the effective filtration pressure describe and what does it depend on?
- The effective filtration pressure is a measure of how much fluid leaves the capillaries into the tissue. It results from the difference between inward and outward forces acting on the capillary wall, which in turn depend on the colloid osmotic and hydrostatic pressure in the plasma and tissue. Since the colloid osmotic pressure in plasma and tissue as well as the hydrostatic pressure in the tissue are relatively constant, the hydrostatic pressure of the plasma plays the main role. If this is, for example, increased by a rise in venous blood pressure, the filtration pressure also increases.
