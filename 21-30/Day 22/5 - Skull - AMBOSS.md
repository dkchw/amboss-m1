# Skull
## Summary

The human skull consists of up to 30 bones and can anatomically be divided into two main parts: the facial skull and the cranial skull. The facial skull includes the bones that form the face; the cranial skull contains those that house the brain. Skull sutures and the so-called fontanelles between the bones of the skull cap allow it to remain pliable for childbirth and adjust to the growth of the brain. At the bottom of the skull are the inner and outer skull base, characterized by passageways for nerves, arteries, and veins. An important joint that is mainly responsible for food intake is the temporomandibular joint. This connects the movable lower jaw bone to the rest of the skull and is stabilized by ligaments and a joint capsule.

The eyes and the nasal cavity are discussed in separate chapters (see: Eye and Orbit; Nose and Paranasal Sinuses).
## Skull Bones

The skull can functionally be roughly divided into a brain- (neurocranium) and a facial skull (viscerocranium). The facial skull largely includes the bones that give the face its structure, while the braincase encompasses the bones that surround the brain. For primates, including humans, it is typical for the braincase to be larger than the facial skull.

- Neurocranium
    - Surrounds the brain
    - Mainly consists of frontal bone, parietal, temporal, and occipital
- Viscerocranium
    - Gives the face its structure
    - This includes, among others, the zygomatic bone, lacrimal and nasal bones, as well as the maxilla and the mandible

|Bones Facial Skull|Bones Cranial Skull|
|---|---|
|- Temporal region<br>    - Temporal bone (temporal bone): Tympanic part, Styloid process of the temporal bone<br>    - Zygomatic bone (cheekbone)<br>- Nasal region<br>    - Lacrimal bone (lacrimal bone)<br>    - Nasal bone (nasal bone)<br>    - Inferior nasal concha (lower nasal turbinate)<br>    - Vomer (plowshare bone)<br>    - Ethmoid bone (ethmoid bone), except for the cribriform plate<br>    - Sphenoid bone (sphenoid bone): Pterygoid process<br>- Jaw region<br>    - Maxilla (upper jaw)<br>    - Mandible (lower jaw)<br>- Oral region<br>    - Palatine bone (palate bone)<br>    - Hyoid bone (hyoid bone)|- Front<br>    - Frontal bone (frontal bone)<br>    - Ethmoid bone (ethmoid bone); Cribriform plate<br>    - Sphenoid bone (sphenoid bone); except for the pterygoid process<br>- Side<br>    - Parietal bone (parietal bone)<br>    - Temporal bone (temporal bone): Squamous part of the temporal bone, Petrous part of the temporal bone (= petrous bone)<br>- Back: Occipital bone (occipital bone)|
## Skullcap

The skullcap (also known as calvaria or skull vault) consists of the frontal bone, parietal bone, and occipital bone. The skullcap is smooth on the outside and is only interrupted by the sutures and fontanelles. On the inside, it is characterized by bony protrusions for the attachment of the brain as well as grooves and holes through which vessels pass.

### Bony Structures

From the temporal bone and the occipital bone, only small portions are visible from the top view of the skullcap. They are therefore not structurally significant and will not be treated separately.

| |Outside|Inside|
|---|---|---|
|Parietal bone|- Parietal foramen: Entry point for the emissary vein of the parietal|- Arterial sulci: Grooves in which the meningeal arteries run<br>- Sulcus of the superior sagittal sinus: Groove in which the superior sagittal sinus runs<br>- Granular foveolae<br>    - Small holes along the sulcus of the superior sagittal sinus<br>    - Formed by protrusions of the arachnoidea<br>- Emissaries: Groove for the emissary veins|
|Frontal bone|- (none)|- Crista frontalis: bony ridge to which the falx cerebri is attached<br>- Frontal sinus (forehead sinus)|

### Skull Sutures (Sutures)

Skull sutures are band structures – similar to a syndesmosis – between the bones of the skullcap, which ossify in childhood or over the course of life. They belong to the false joints and serve the deformability of the skull. In total, there are about 33, of which four represent the main sutures.

- Frontal suture (“Frontal suture”, “Forehead suture”)
    - It separates the frontal bone in the middle into two halves.
    - Ends at the coronal suture
    - In adults, it is usually no longer visible.
- Coronary suture (“Coronal suture”, “Garland suture”)
    - It separates the frontal bone from the right and left parietal bones
    - Runs perpendicular to the frontal suture
- Sagittal suture ("Sagittal suture", "Arrow suture")
    - Separates the right from the left parietal bone
    - Extension of the frontal suture (runs perpendicular to the coronal suture)
    - Ends at the lambdoid suture (border with the occipital bone)
- Lambdoid suture ("Lambdanaht")
    - Separates the right and left parietal bones from the occipital bone and temporal bone.
    - Runs downwards from the central sagittal suture to the left and right towards the temporal bone

> [!NOTE] Craniosynostosis
> A premature closure of skull sutures leads to typical skull deformities, which are also called craniosynostoses!

### Fontanelles (Fonticulus)

Fontanelles are non-ossified areas between the skull bones that typically close during childhood. They make the skull of the infant so pliable that it can fit through the birth canal and can adapt to the size growth of the brain. The two most important fontanelles are the anterior, large fontanelle and the posterior, small fontanelle. Additionally, there are the less significant fonticulus sphenoidalis at the sphenoid bone and fonticulus mastoideus at the mastoid bone.

- Anterior fontanelle ("large fontanel")
    - It is diamond-shaped located in the middle between the frontal bone and the parietal bones
    - Frontal, coronary, and sagittal suture border it.
- Posterior fontanelle („small fontanelle“)
    - It is triangularly located in the middle between the parietal bones and the occipital bone
    - Lambda and sagittal suture are adjacent to it.
- Fonticulus sphenoidalis
- Fonticulus mastoid

> [!NOTE] Liquor acquisition via the fontanelle
> In cases of suspected meningitis, cerebrospinal fluid can be obtained from the anterior fontanelle in infants liquor from the large fontanel.

> [!NOTE] Reference point at birth
> The small fontanel is important for midwives and serves as a reference point for the position of the baby's head during the birthing process.

### Structure Skull Bones

The skullcap consists of two layers of compact bone (external lamina and internal lamina) and an intervening layer of spongy bone (spongiosa).

1. Outer lamina
    - Lies beneath the scalp
    - Covered by periosteum
2. Spongiosa (Diploe)
    - Contains red bone marrow for blood formation and the Vv. diploicae
3. Inner lamina
    - Located above the brain
    - Covered by the Dura mater

> [!NOTE]
> Through the venous connections of the skullcap to the brain, infections can spread easily!

> [!NOTE] Impact of violence on the skull roof
> The inner lamina is considered particularly brittle and is therefore also called glass skin (lamina vitrea). In the event of trauma to the skullcap, it can therefore happen that the outer lamina remains intact while the inner lamina is shattered.

## Cranial fossae and cranial base

The base of the skull is located at the underside of the skull. There is an internal (internal base of the skull) and an external base of the skull (external base of the skull), which can each be divided into three different sections. The internal base of the skull is subdivided based on the three so-called cranial fossae (anterior cranial fossa, middle cranial fossa, posterior cranial fossa). In contrast, the external base of the skull is divided into a front, middle, and rear section based on its structural bones. Both bases of the skull are characterized by small holes and canals through which a variety of conduits run. The most important ones will be presented in the following tables.

### Cranial Fossae (Fossae cranii)

The cranial cavity can be divided from front to back into three depressions: anterior cranial fossa, middle cranial fossa, and posterior cranial fossa. They help to provide a spatial orientation to the structures of the skull and sections of the brain.

- Anterior cranial fossa: Vordere Schädelgrube, is located below the frontal lobe
- Fossa cranii media: Middle cranial fossa, contains among other things the Pituitary gland
- Fossa cranii posterior: Posterior cranial fossa, location of the cerebellum and brainstem

### Temporal fossa, Infratemporal fossa, Pterygopalatine fossa

In addition to the large cavities for our sense organs, there are other important depressions in the skull through which nerves and vessels run. Three of these will be discussed in more detail here.

|Specialization|Location|Limitation|Connection to other cranial cavities (via … → in …)|Main Content|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Temporal fossa (Temporal depression)|- Cranial to the zygomatic arch at the Temporal bone|- Roof: Temporal bone<br>- Floor: Zygomatic arch, Sphenoid bone<br>- Rostral: Zygomatic bone, Frontal bone<br>- Occipital: Temporal bone, Parietal bone|- Inferior orbital fissure → Orbit|- Auriculotemporal nerve<br>- Superficial temporal artery<br>- Temporalis muscle<br>- Zygomaticotemporal nerve<br>- Deep temporal arteries|
|Infratemporal fossa (Fossa infratemporalis)|- Below the temporal fossa, medial to the zygomatic arch and mandibular ramus|- Roof: Sphenoid bone, Temporal bone<br>- Floor: Lateral pterygoid muscle, Medial pterygoid muscle<br>- Rostral: Maxilla<br>- Occipital: Temporal bone, Sphenoid bone|- Inferior orbital fissure → Orbit<br>- Oval foramen → Middle cranial fossa<br>- Spinosum foramen → Middle cranial fossa|- Mandibular nerve<br>- Otic ganglion<br>- Maxillary artery<br>- Pterygoid venous plexus<br>- Medial pterygoid muscle<br>- Lateral pterygoid muscle|

> [!NOTE] Juvenile Angiofibroma 
> The juvenile angiofibroma is a benign vascular-rich tumor that expands displacing from the sphenopalatine foramen (between the pterygopalatine fossa and the nasal cavity). Due to the symptoms it causes (especially recurrent, sometimes severe nosebleeds), and its displacing growth, the juvenile angiofibroma can clinically appear malignant, although it does not metastasize. It primarily occurs in male adolescents from the age of 10. For surgical removal, an approach through the infratemporal fossa was previously chosen, but today a mostly endoscopic transnasal approach is used.

## Jaw and Temporomandibular Joint

### Jaw

The jaw consists of the two maxillary bones (right and left maxilla) and the mandible (mandibula), which are functionally connected through the temporomandibular joint (temporomandibular joint).

#### Upper Jaw (Maxilla)

The maxilla is part of the facial skull and consists of:

- Corpus maxillae with the infraorbital foramen (exit point of the A., V. and N. infraorbitalis)
- Frontal process: Insertion point of M. levator labii superioris, M. orbicularis oculi and Lig. palpebrae medial
- Zygomatic process of the maxilla: Connects the zygomatic bone with the maxilla
- Palatine process: Part of the hard palate and the floor of the nasal cavity.
- Alveolar process: Site of the teeth

#### Mandible (Mandibula)

The lower jawbone is U-shaped and consists of:

- Body of the mandible (lower jaw)
    - Alveolar parts (Alveolarteil): Location of the teeth
    - Mental foramen: Exit point of the mental nerve (from N. V3)
- Mandibular angle: Connects Body of the mandible and Ramus of the mandible
- Ramus mandibulae (mandibular ramus): Ascending bony branches on the right and left of the Corpus mandibulae
    - Lingula mandibulae (mandibular lingula): small bony projection on the inner side in direct proximity to the mandibular foramen.
    - Head of the mandible (mandibular head)
        - At the cranial end of the ramus mandibulae
        - Serves as the temporomandibular joint as the articular head

> [!NOTE]
> To anesthetize the mandible for a dental treatment, the anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve is sufficient. For this purpose, local anesthesia is injected on the inner side of the ramus of the mandible in the area of the mandibular foramen. However, since the lingual nerve also runs here, it is often anesthetized as well!

### Temporomandibular Joint (Articulatio temporomandibularis)

- Definition: Joint, which connects the lower jaw to the skull and thus enables chewing.
- Function: Rotational movement, Translational movement, Grinding movement
- Joint type: Rotational and sliding joint, two-chamber system
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Articular cavity: Mandibular fossa of the temporal bone (squamous part) with the articular tubercle (Tuberculum articulare)
        - Gelenkkopf: Head of the mandible
    - Soft tissue
        - Articular disc
        - Elastic joint capsule (Capsula articularis): Is reinforced by connective tissue ligaments (medial and lateral ligaments)
        - Bands
            - Stylomandibular ligament
            - Sphenomandibular ligament

> [!NOTE] Jaw clamp and jaw lock
> In the case of a wide opening of the mouth, it can happen that the condyle of the mandible slips in front of the articular tubercle and gets stuck there. This results in the inability to close the mouth and leads to a so-called jaw lock. The jaw clamp refers to a condition in which the mouth can no longer be opened or can only be partially opened (e.g., as a result of abscesses or a mandibular fracture).

> [!NOTE] Final bite position (occlusion)
> Occlusion refers to the position of both dental arches when the chewing muscles are contracted. Depending on the position of the upper and lower dental arches in relation to each other, different dental alignments are distinguished. In Germany, the overbite (psalidodontia) is the most common, where the upper jaw incisors move in front of the lower jaw incisors. A rarer form is the underbite (progeny), where the incisors of the lower jaw are positioned in front of those of the upper jaw.

### Development

### Ossification of the skull bones

Histologically, one distinguishes between desmal and chondral ossification in the ossification of skull bones. In desmal ossification, the bone forms directly from mesenchymal connective tissue, whereas in chondral ossification, it occurs indirectly through a remodeling of cartilage tissue. Depending on the type of ossification, the skull bones can be historically divided into desmo- and chondrocranium (see also: bone tissue).

|Bones of the Desmocranium|Bones of the Chondrocranium|
|---|---|
|- Mandible<br>- Maxilla<br>- Frontal bone<br>- Lacrimal bone<br>- Nasal bone<br>- Occipital bone (upper part of the Squama)<br>- Palatine bone<br>- Parietal bone<br>- Temporal bone (Squamous part, Tympanic part)<br>- Zygomatic bone<br>- Vomer|- Inferior nasal concha<br>- Ethmoid bone<br>- Hyoid bone<br>- Occipital bone (except upper part of the Squama)<br>- Sphenoid bone<br>- Temporal bone (Petrous part, Styloid process)|

> [!NOTE] Cleidocranial dysostosis
> The clavicles (collarbones) are the only long bones that undergo intramembranous ossification. Therefore, if there is a disruption of intramembranous ossification during childhood development, the skull and the clavicles can be deformed, small, or inadequately developed.

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Skull
### Skullcap

Where is the large or small fontanelle located? Which skull sutures border each one?
- The diamond-shaped large fontanelle (Fonticulus anterior) lies between the Os frontale and the Ossa parietalia and borders the sagittal, coronal, and frontal sutures. The small triangular fontanelle (Fonticulus posterior) lies between the Ossa parietalia and Os occipitale and borders the lambda as well as the sagittal suture.
What are the four main sutures of the skull? How do they run?
- The four main sutures of the skull are the Sutura frontalis (frontal suture, usually no longer visible in adults), which divides the Os frontale into two halves in the middle, the Sutura coronalis (coronal suture), which runs perpendicular to the Sutura frontalis, the Sutura sagittalis (sagittal suture), which, as an extension of the Sutura frontalis, separates the Ossa parietale, and the Suturae lambdoideae, which run downward on the right and left from the Sutura sagittalis toward the Os temporale.

### Cranial Fossae and Base of Skull

Where does the A. ophthalmica exit from the skull base?
- The A. ophthalmica passes together with the N. opticus through the Canalis opticus in the Fossa cranii media.
From which bones does the superior orbital fissure form? Which structures pass through it?
- The Fissura orbitalis superior is formed from the Alae major and minor of the Os sphenoidale. Through it pass the N. oculomotorius (III), N. trochlearis (IV), N. abducens (VI), branches of the N. ophthalmicus (N. lacrimalis, N. frontalis, N. nasociliaris) as well as the V. ophthalmica superior.
Which structures pass through the adjacent ovale, rotundum, and spinosum foramina?
- The N. maxillaris leaves the skull base through the Foramen rotundum and the N. mandibularis together with the A. meningea accessoria through the Foramen ovale. The A. and V. meningea media pass together with the R. meningeus of the N. mandibularis through the Foramen spinosum.
Which passage points for which structures are located in the temporal bone?
- The Os temporale is involved in both the Fossa cranii media and posterior. The passage points in the Fossa cranii media are the Canalis caroticus with the A. carotis interna, the Foramen lacerum with the Nn. petrosus profundus and petrosus major as well as two small openings for the Nn. petrosus major and minor. In the Fossa cranii posterior lies the Porus acusticus internus in the Os temporale, through which the N. facialis, N. vestibulocochlearis, and the A. + V. labyrinthi pass.
Which structures pass through the foramen magnum?
- Through the Foramen magnum pass the Medulla spinalis, R. spinalis of the N. accessorii, Aa. vertebrales, Aa. spinalis anterior et posterior, and V. spinalis.
Which foramina are located in the posterior cranial fossa in the occipital bone?
- In the Fossa cranii posterior lie in the Os occipitale the Foramina magnum and jugulare and the Canalis nervi hypoglossi.
Which structures pass through the inferior orbital fissure?
- Through the Fissura orbitalis inferior pass the N. infraorbitalis and N. zygomaticus (both from V2) together with the A. and V. infraorbitalis and V. ophthalmicus inferior.
Where is the pterygopalatine fossa located and what role does it play?
- The Fossa pterygopalatina is bounded rostrally by the Os palatinum and Maxilla, occipitally by the Processus pterygoideus and Os sphenoidale, cranially by the Os sphenoidale, and caudally by the Retropharyngeal space. Various canals and openings connect it with neighboring regions (paranasal sinus, orbit, oral cavity, middle cranial fossa, infratemporal fossa). These structures include the Fissura orbitalis inferior, Canalis pterygoideus, Foramen sphenopalatinum, Fissura pterygomaxillaris, and Foramina palatina major and minor. Due to these numerous passageways for important structures, it is clinically significant.
Through which connection is the orbit connected to the pterygopalatine fossa?
- The Fissura orbitalis inferior connects the Fossa pterygopalatina with the orbit.

### Jaw and Jaw Joint

At which part of the skull does an articular disc occur and what function does it have?
- The articular surfaces of the Fossa mandibularis and Caput mandibulae are highly incongruent. The intervening Discus articularis compensates for this incongruence, cushions the forces acting on the temporomandibular joint, and also allows both gliding and grinding movements as well as hinge movements.
Through which foramen does the inferior alveolar nerve pass, and why is this clinically significant?
- The N. alveolaris inferior is a branch of the N. mandibularis (V3) and passes through the Foramen mandibula at the ramus mandibulae of the mandible. This is relevant, for example, for local anesthesia during dental treatments of the lower jaw, as the anesthetic is injected here.
Why can there also be taste and sensitivity loss of the tongue during local anesthesia at the dentist?
- Due to the close topographical relationship between the N. alveolaris inferior and the N. lingualis, a local anesthesia of the N. alveolaris inferior at the Foramen mandibulae can also lead to anesthesia of the N. lingualis and thus to taste and sensitivity disorders of the tongue.
