# Pelvis and Hip
## Summary

The bony pelvis consists of the two ossa coxae, which are firmly connected in front by the symphysis, and the os sacrum, which continues the spine caudally and closes the pelvic ring dorsally. The shape of the pelvis differs significantly between women and men, allowing for sex determination in skeletons. In addition to the symphysis and the sacroiliac joint between os coxae and os sacrum, the hip joint is also located in the pelvic region: it represents the connection of the lower extremity with the trunk, is a ball-and-socket joint, and allows for an upright posture without constant muscle effort due to its strong ligaments. The muscles of the hip region are essential for walking and standing and are correspondingly strong. The nerves of the region originate from the lumbosacral plexus, and the vessels come from the A. and V. iliaca communis.
## Bones

The pelvis consists of three bones: the hip bone, the sacrum, and the coccyx.

### The hip bones (Hüftbein)

The hip bone develops during embryonic development from three bones: the pubic bone (Os pubis), the ilium (Os ilium), and the ischium (Os ischii). They are separated by Y-shaped growth plates (so-called Y-joint) and unite around the age of 15 to form the common hip bone of the adult.

- The ilium
    - Wing of the ilium
        - Iliac crest
            - Anterior superior and inferior iliac spine
            - Posterior superior and inferior iliac spine
        - Outer surface: Gluteal surface
            - Anterior and posterior gluteal line
        - Inner surface: Iliac Fossa
            - Iliac tuberosity
            - Auricular surface of the ilium
    - Iliac bone
        - Inferior gluteal line
        - Supratabular sulcus
        - Greater sciatic notch
        - Arcuate line of the ilium: Connects with the Pecten of the pubic bone
- The pubis
    - Pubic bone corpus
    - Superior ramus of the pubic bone
        - Pecten of the pubic bone
        - Pubic tubercle
    - Inferior ramus of the pubic bone
        - Symphyseal surface of the pubic bone
- The ischium
    - Ischial bone corpus
        - Ischial spine
        - Lesser sciatic notch
    - Ramus of the ischial bone
        - Ischial tuberosity
- Acetabulum: Socket of the Hip Joint, consists of all three bony components.
    - Limb of the acetabulum
    - Lunate surface of the acetabulum: Articular surface
    - Acetabular fossa
    - Acetabular notch
- Obturator foramen: Large opening between ischium and pubis

> [!NOTE] Appendicitis Signs
> The anterior superior iliac spine can be easily felt through the skin by most people. Therefore, it is often used as a reference point during the physical examination: For example, if one wishes to test whether a patient’s appendix is inflamed, pressure can be applied to the so-called Lanz point: This point is located in the right third on an imaginary line connecting the two anterior superior iliac spines. If the cecum is inflamed, pressing on the Lanz point would likely lead to pain.

### The sacrum (sacrum)

The sacrum develops from fused vertebral bodies, which is why its structures are primarily derived from the former structures of the vertebral body. For example, the two dorsal medial sacral crests arise from the fusion of the former articular processes (Procc. articulares).

- Area of the former Vertebral body
    - Base of the sacrum
    - Promontory of the sacral bone
    - Transverse lines of the sacrum
    - Superior articular process
    - Pelvic face
- Former Vertebral canal: Sacral canal
    - Sacral hiatus
    - Sacral horns
- Fused costal processes: Lateral part
    - Auricular surface
    - Tuberosity of the sacral bone
    - Lateral sacral crest
    - Anterior and posterior sacral foramina
- Former dorsal spines: Median sacral crest
    - Medial sacral crest

### Coccyx (Coccyx)

The coccyx is connected to the sacrococcygeal joint with the sacrum and consists of fused vertebrae.

- Coccygeal cornua
- Sacrococcygeal joint
- Coccyx

### Gender-Specific Differences in Pelvic Shape

Due to the special demands on the female pelvis during  childbirth, there are some gender-specific characteristics in the external shape of the pelvis.

|Gender-specific Differences|Women|Men|
|---|---|---|
|Entrance to the Beck|Round to oval|Heart-shaped|
|Angle between the inferior rami of the pubic bone|Over 90° (Pubic arch)|Under 90° (Pubic angle)|
|Shape of the ilium wings|Broadly spreading|Steeply angled|

### Diameter and Conjugate

The size of the pelvis and pelvic inlet is described by the so-called pelvic measurements. These play a role especially in obstetrics, as they help to describe the width of the birth canal.

|Pelvic Measurements|Description|Average Value|
|---|---|---|
|Transverse diameter|- Desired inner diameter of the pelvis|14 cm|
|Diameter obliqua|- Oblique distance between sacroiliac joint and iliopubic eminence<br>    - Diameter obliqua I: Distance between right sacroiliac joint and left iliopubic eminence<br>    - Diameter obliqua II: Distance between left sacroiliac joint and right iliopubic eminence|12 cm|
|Anatomical conjugate|- Distance between the upper edge of the symphysis and the promontory|12 cm|
|Conjugate diagonal|- Distance between the lower edge of the symphysis and the promontory<br>- Can be determined vaginally|12–13 cm|
|Conjugata vera|- Distance between the retropubic eminence and the promontory<br>- Most important pelvic measurement, as it represents the narrowest diameter of the pelvis<br>- Can be calculated from the Conjugata diagonalis|11 cm|

> [!NOTE]
> Conjugata vera and Conjugata anatomica are both distances between symphysis and promontory: The Conjugata vera is located slightly dorsal to the Conjugata anatomica and measures the narrowest diameter of the pelvis there!

## Bands and Joints

The bones of the pelvis are connected to each other by the symphysis and the sacroiliac joint. The hip joint allows for a wide range of motion in the lower extremity.

### Hip Joint

The hip joint connects the lower extremity with the torso and allows the leg a great range of motion. The stability of the hip joint, which is essential for walking and standing, is provided by a tight ligament structure and a hemispherical joint socket, formed by the acetabulum and the fibrocartilaginous labrum acetabuli.

- Definition: Joint between Femur and Hip bone
- Function: Flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, as well as rotation of the thigh
    - Flexion/Extension 140°/0°/15°
        - The flexion is limited by the active insufficiency of the flexor muscles.
        - The extension is primarily inhibited by the iliofemoral ligament
    - Abduction/Adduction 40°/0°/25°
    - Internal/External rotation 35°/0°/45° (with flexed hip)
- Joint type: Ball-and-socket joint with three degrees of freedom (also called "hip joint" = Enarthrosis)
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Lunate surface of the acetabulum of the hip bone
        - Head of the femur
    - Soft tissue
        - Acetabular labrum (articular lip made of fibrocartilage)
        - Transverse ligament of the acetabulum: Completes the crescent-shaped articular surface of the lunate surface into a hemisphere by spanning the acetabular notch.
        - Ligament of the head of the femur
            - Pulls from the acetabular fossa to the femoral head
            - Carries the A. capitis femoris and has no mechanical significance
        - Joint capsule
            - Covers large parts of the femoral neck
            - Reinforced by bands
                - Orbicular zone, Iliopsoas ligament, Ischiofemoral ligament and Pubofemoral ligament: Primarily inhibit extension and thus allow for an upright posture without muscle use.
        - Band-based stabilization of the hip joint
            - Orbicular zone
            - Iliofemoral ligament
            - Ischiofemoral ligament
            - Pubofemoral ligament

> [!NOTE]
> The iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body. During extension, it intertwines with the other ligaments of the hip joint and thus stabilizes the upright position!

### Symphyse (Pubic symphysis)

- Definition: Fibrous connection of the two pubic bones
- Function: Compensates for shear forces generated while walking.
- Joint type: Synarthrosis
- Involved Structures
    - Bone: Symphyseal surface of the left and right pubic bone
    - Soft tissue
        - Pubic disc
        - Superior and inferior pubic ligaments

### Sacroiliac Joint (Articulatio sacroiliaca)

The sacroiliac joint connects the spine, which rests on the sacrum, with the hip bone.

- Definition: Strong joint between sacrum and ilium
- Function: Force transmission from the spine to the pelvis and thus to the lower extremity
- Joint Type: Amphiarthrosis
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Auricular surface of the ilium
        - Auricular facet of the sacrum
    - Soft tissue
        - Anterior, posterior, and interosseous sacroiliac ligaments: Prevent the sliding of the sacrum downward
            - Thus carry the entire weight of the upper body and torso
        - Sacrotuberous ligament and sacrospinous ligament: Prevent tilting of the sacral apex backward
            - Form the greater sciatic foramen and lesser (see under Topography)
        - Iliolumbar ligament: Prevents the spreading apart of the iliac wings.

> [!NOTE] Sacroiliitis in Ankylosing Spondylitis  
> In the context of rheumatic diseases such as Ankylosing Spondylitis, inflammation of the sacroiliac joint can occur (known as sacroiliitis). This manifests as dull pain in the lower back, which usually improves throughout the day. Therapeutically, physiotherapy and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are typically used.

### Obturator membrane

- Definition
    - Connective tissue closure of the obturator foramen
    - Represents the Obturator canal
- Penetrating conduit paths
    - A. obturatoria
    - Obturator vein
    - N. obturatorius
- Involved bones: Ramus of the superior and inferior pubic bone as well as ischium: Surround the obturator foramen


> [!NOTE] Obturator hernia
> In very rare cases, a hernia can develop through the obturator membrane: The hernial sac can compress the obturator nerve that runs through the obturator canal, leading to characteristic sensory disturbances or pain in a medial area of skin above the knee. If loops of intestine are present in the hernial sac, they can become trapped and cut off from their blood supply. This so-called incarceration is a feared complication of all hernias.

## Muscles

The musculature of the hip includes the M. gluteus maximus, one of the strongest muscles in the human body, and enables an upright posture. It can be classified into a ventral and a dorsal group based on its relative position to the Os ilium.

### Ventral Hip Musculature (Inner Hip Musculature)

The M. iliopsoas consists of two parts, which can also be understood as individual muscles (M. psoas major and M. iliacus). Between these parts runs the N. femoralis, which innervates both. The M. iliopsoas runs below the inguinal ligament in the Lacuna musculorum to the Trochanter minor.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. psoas major|- Costal processes (1.-5. lumbar vertebrae)<br>- Lateral surfaces of vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs (12th thoracic vertebra-4th lumbar vertebra)|- Lesser trochanter|- Spine: Lateral flexion<br>- Hip joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - External rotation|- Femoral nerve (L1-L4)<br>- Lumbar plexus (direct branches)|
|M. iliacus|- Iliac fossa|- Hip joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - External rotation|

### Dorsal hip musculature with an attachment in the area of the greater trochanter

The dorsal hip muscles are located dorsal to the ilium and perform very different movements in the hip joint depending on their insertion and origin. Except for the "small gluteal muscles" (gluteus medius and minimus), all the muscles mentioned here are innervated by direct branches of the sacral plexus.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. gluteus medius|- Gluteal surface (Ilium)|- Greater trochanter|- Hip joint: Abduction<br>    - Lateral component: Flexion and Internal rotation<br>    - Medial component: Extension and External rotation|- Superior gluteal nerve (L4-S1)|
|M. gluteus minimus|
|M. piriformis|- Pelvic surface (Sacrum)|- Hip joint<br>    - Extension<br>    - Abduction<br>    - External rotation|- Sacral plexus (direct branches, L4-S2)|
|Mm. gemelli|- M. gemellus superior: Ischial spine<br>- M. gemellus inferior: Ischial tuberosity|- Trochanteric fossa|- Hip joint<br>    - Adduction<br>    - External rotation|
|M. obturatorius internus|- Obturator membrane (Inner surface)|
|M. quadratus femoris|- Ischial tuberosity|- Intertrochanteric crest|

> [!NOTE] Trendelenburg Sign
> In this injection method, the injection takes place in the M. gluteus medius. In the patient lying in the lateral position, the Spina iliaca anterior superior is located with the index finger, and the Eminentia cristae iliacae is located with the middle finger. If the injection is to be performed in the left M. gluteus medius, the locating of the points is carried out with the right hand and vice versa. The hand is now turned approximately 2cm ventrally, so that the palm comes to rest on the Trochanter major. The injection area is the caudal part of the "V" between the index and middle fingers and can be marked, for example, with a cannula cap. The injection is done vertically, with the needle tip pointing slightly cranially. A major advantage of this method is the protection of the N. ischiadicus and the N. gluteus superior, which is why the method is used very frequently. There are other methods that also target the M. gluteus medius as an injection site, but they are less safe.

> [!NOTE] Trendelenburg Sign
> If, for example, a faulty intragluteal injection results in damage to the superior gluteal nerve, the hip cannot be held horizontally when standing on the affected leg: The hip tilts towards the healthy side (Trendelenburg sign). If the small gluteal muscles are paralyzed or weakened on both sides (e.g., in the context of a muscular dystrophy), the so-called Trendelenburg or Duchenne limp occurs: To stabilize the body despite the sinking of the hip when standing on one leg, the upper body is shifted towards the side of the standing leg. With each step, the upper body must therefore be leaned towards the standing leg, resulting in a typical waddling gait.

### Dorsal Hip Musculature with a Distal Insertion

The gluteus maximus is one of the strongest muscles in the human body and is primarily responsible for the extension of the hip joint. This prevents the pelvis from tilting forward. In the event of paralysis of the muscle, jumping, walking, and standing up from a seated position are often no longer possible.

|Name|   |Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. tensor fasciae latae|   |- Anterior superior iliac spine|- Over iliotibial tract to lateral condyle of tibia|- Hip joint<br>    - Flexion<br>    - Abduction<br>    - Internal rotation<br>- Tenses the iliotibial tract|- Superior gluteal nerve (L4-S1)|
|M. gluteus maximus|   |- Iliac crest<br>- Posterior superior iliac spine<br>- Dorsal surface (Sacrum)<br>- Gluteal surface (Ilium)|- Gluteal tuberosity (Femur)<br>- Via Iliotibial tract to Lateral condyle of tibia|- Hip joint<br>    - Extension<br>    - External rotation<br>    - Abduction and adduction|- Inferior gluteal nerve (L5-S2)|
## Vascular Supply and Innervation

This section provides an overview of vascular supply and innervation of the hip and pelvic region. For more detailed information on the involved pathways, see also: Pelvic Cavity (Pathways of the Pelvis) and Pathways of the Lower Extremity (Lumbosacral Plexus).

|Vessel Supply|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Arterial/Venous|   |- A./V. iliaca interna from A. iliaca communis or into V. iliaca communis<br>    - A./V. glutea superior and inferior<br>    - Aa./Vv. sacrales laterales<br>    - A./V. obturatoria<br>- A./V. iliaca externa from A. iliaca communis or into V. iliaca communis<br>    - Aa./Vv. pudendae externae<br>    - A./V. circumflexa ilium profunda and superficialis|
|Innervation|   |   |
|Motorisch|   |- Superior gluteal nerve and Inferior gluteal nerve<br>- Obturator nerve<br>- Femoral nerve<br>- Sciatic nerve<br>- Direct branches of the sacral plexus|
|Sensory|   |- Superior and middle cluneal nerves (directly from the lumbar spinal nerves) as well as inferior cluneal nerves (from posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh)<br>- Iliohypogastric nerve<br>- Genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve<br>- Pudendal nerve (cutaneous branches)<br>- Coccygeal nerve (cutaneous branches)|
## Topography

The openings of the pelvis serve as passage points for many nerves and vessels. The following table lists the most important ones.

|Name|Foramina|Boundaries|Description|Penetrating Structures|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ventral Vascular-Nerve Space (Thigh Gate)|Lacuna vasorum|- Ventral: Inguinal Ligament<br>- Dorsal: Upper edge of the Pubic Bone<br>- Lateral: Iliopectineal Arch<br>- Medial: Lacunar Ligament|- Medial gap beneath the Inguinal Ligament<br>- Femoral Ring: Medial to the Femoral Vein lies the area of the Lacuna vasorum, which is fibrous sealed by the femoral septum<br>    - On the inside is the so-called Rosenmüller Lymph Node<br>    - Multiple perforations by lymphatic vessels|- From medial to lateral<br>    - Femoral Vein<br>    - Femoral Artery<br>    - R. femoralis of the Genitofemoral Nerve|

|Medial vascular nerve route|Obturator canal|- Obturator groove and fiber bundles of the obturator membrane|- Opening in the obturator membrane|- A. and V. obturatoria<br>- N. obturatorius|
|Dorsal vascular nerve route|Greater sciatic foramen|- Ventral: Greater sciatic notch<br>- Posteromedial: Sacrotuberous ligament<br>- Caudal: Sacrospinous ligament<br>- Cranial: Anterior sacroiliac ligament|- Through the greater sciatic foramen passes the piriformis muscle. It divides it into a suprapiriform foramen and an infrapiriform foramen|- Suprapiriform foramen<br>    - Superior gluteal artery<br>    - Superior gluteal vein<br>    - Superior gluteal nerve<br>- Infrapiriform foramen<br>    - Inferior gluteal artery and vein<br>    - Inferior gluteal nerve<br>    - Sciatic nerve<br>    - Posterior femoral cutaneous nerve<br>    - Pudendal nerve<br>    - Internal pudendal artery and vein<br>    - Nerves to the internal obturator muscle and quadratus femoris muscle|
|Lesser sciatic foramen|- Cranial: Sacrospinal ligament<br>- Caudal: Sacrotuberous ligament|- The structures passing through here have previously traversed the Greater sciatic foramen, circled the Ischial spine, and then re-enter the pelvis through the Lesser sciatic foramen<br>- Serves as a hypomochlion for the Internal obturator muscle|- Internal pudendal A. and V.<br>- Pudendal nerve<br>- Internal obturator muscle|
|Vascular-Nerve-Street in the ischioanal fossa|Pudendal canal (Alcock's canal)|- Lateral: Obturator fascia<br>- Medial: Fat tissue of the ischioanal fossa|- Forms a passage canal between the obturator fascia and the ischioanal fossa through the pelvic floor<br>    - The obturator fascia is a fascial duplication of the M. obturatorius internus<br>    - The ischioanal fossa is a wedge-shaped space filled with fat and connective tissue in the posterior pelvic floor<br>        - Here, the N. pudendus branches into its terminal branches, the perineal nerves|- A. and V. pudenda interna<br>- N. pudendus|

> [!NOTE] Trendelenburg Sign
> The lacuna vasorum and lacuna musculorum can become inguinal rings for hernias. This is referred to as femoral hernias, in contrast to inguinal hernias, which have their inguinal ring above the inguinal ligament. Femoral hernias are relatively rare compared to inguinal hernias; they account for only about 5% of hernias. Additionally, they are always acquired; congenital femoral hernias do not occur. Mostly, the hernial sac protrudes through the lacuna vasorum, less commonly through the lacuna musculorum. The external inguinal ring is usually the saphenous hiatus, which is located in the area of the femoral triangle. The most feared complication of femoral hernias is intestinal obstruction (ileus). Femoral hernias always require surgical intervention.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Pelvis and Hip
### Bone

From the fusion of which structures does the sacrum arise? How are the medial sacral crests formed accordingly?
- The Os sacrum arises postnatally from fused vertebral bodies, which is why its structures mainly derive from former vertebral body structures. For example, the two dorsally located medial sacral crests are formed by the fusion of the former articular processes (Procc. articulares).
The size of the pelvis and pelvic inlet is described by the so-called pelvic measurements. What does the anatomical conjugate measure?
- The Conjugata anatomica measures the distance between the upper edge of the symphysis and the promontory.
Which pelvic measurement describes the shortest diameter of the pelvis and how can it be determined?
- The Conjugata vera measures the distance between the retropubic eminence of the symphysis and the promontory, which corresponds to the narrowest diameter of the pelvis. Since this is especially important for the birthing process, the Conjugata vera is considered the most important pelvic measurement. It cannot be measured directly vaginally, but can be determined via the easily measurable Conjugata diagonalis (distance between the promontory of the Os sacrum and the lower edge of the symphysis). This is usually exactly 1.5 cm longer than the Conjugata vera.
### Ligaments and Joints

What type of joint is the sacroiliac joint?
- The sacroiliac joint belongs to the amphiarthroses or tight joints. It is a true joint with a joint space, but its range of motion is greatly restricted by a tight joint capsule and a tight ligament apparatus.
What functions do the ligamentum capitis femoris (ligament of the femoral head) and the ligamentum transversum acetabuli have?
- The ligamentum capitis femoris has no mechanical significance for the hip; it carries the artery to the femoral head, which supplies the femoral head with blood. The ligamentum transversum acetabuli spans and closes the acetabular notch and thereby completes the articular surface of the lunate surface.
### Muscles

Where are the origin and insertion of the two components of the iliopsoas muscle? What movement does it cause in the hip joint and spine?
- The M. iliopsoas consists of two parts: The M. psoas major originates from the costal processes of the 1st to 5th lumbar vertebrae, the lateral surfaces of the vertebral bodies, and the intervertebral discs between the 12th thoracic vertebra and 4th lumbar vertebra. The M. iliacus originates widely from the iliac fossa. Together, they insert as the M. iliopsoas at the lesser trochanter. The M. iliopsoas is the most important flexor of the hip joint and also causes external rotation. A unilateral contraction of the M. psoas major leads to lateral flexion of the spine, and a bilateral contraction supports rising from a lying position by moving the spine ventrally.
What is the so-called Trendelenburg sign and what causes it?
- The Trendelenburg sign describes a clinical finding in which the hip tilts to one side during single-leg standing. Physiologically, the hip is held horizontally during single-leg standing by abduction of the gluteus medius and minimus muscles. If these two muscles fail, for example due to damage to the superior gluteal nerve in the context of a faulty intragluteal injection, the hip tilts toward the healthy side.
In which gluteal muscle is injected during a ventrogluteal injection according to Hochstetter?
- In the technique of the ventrogluteal injection according to Hochstetter, the injection (e.g., of depot medications) is given into the gluteus medius muscle, which is located using specific bony landmarks. A major advantage of this method is the protection of the sciatic nerve and the superior gluteal nerve.
Name the origin and approach of the M. quadratus femoris and the M. obturatorius internus!
- The M. quadratus femoris originates at the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the intertrochanteric crest. The M. obturatorius internus originates on the internal surface of the obturator membrane (between the pubic bone and ischium) and inserts at the trochanteric fossa.
What is the function of the M. gluteus maximus and in which movements is it active accordingly?
- The M. gluteus maximus is one of the strongest muscles of the human body. It is primarily responsible for the extension of the hip joint and is therefore active in movements such as climbing stairs, jumping, walking, and rising from a seated position.
Name the origin, approach, and function of the M. tensor fasciae latae!
- The M. tensor fasciae latae originates at the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts into the iliotibial tract, which attaches to the lateral condyle of the tibia. It causes flexion, abduction, and internal rotation of the hip and also tightens the iliotibial tract, thereby acting as a balancing force against the bending stress of the femur ("tension band principle").
### Topography

What anatomical passageways in the pelvis can become a hernial orifice for femoral hernias? How is their relationship to the inguinal ligament?
- A femoral hernia refers to the protrusion of abdominal organs through the lacunae vasorum or musculorum. In most cases, the hernia passes through the fibrous femoral septum at the medial edge of the lacuna vasorum. Unlike the more common inguinal hernias, femoral hernias therefore run underneath the inguinal ligament.
What structures pass through the Lacuna musculorum?
- The lacuna musculorum forms a lateral gap beneath the inguinal ligament. The iliopsoas muscle, the femoral nerve, and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve pass through it.
What structure divides the greater sciatic foramen and which blood vessels run through the two foramina created by it?
- The piriformis muscle runs from the pelvic surface of the sacrum to the tip of the greater trochanter. It passes through the greater sciatic foramen, dividing it into an infrapiriform and suprapiriform foramen. The superior gluteal vessels pass through the suprapiriform foramen, and the inferior gluteal and internal pudendal vessels run through the infrapiriform foramen.
Which nerve pathways pass through the lesser sciatic foramen?
- The lesser sciatic foramen is traversed by the internal pudendal artery and vein as well as the pudendal nerve. These pathways initially exit the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and then re-enter through the lesser sciatic foramen after rounding the ischial spine.
The obturator foramen is completely fibrous closed off by the obturator membrane, except for a small canal. What is the name of this canal and which vessels pass through it?
- The obturator canal is formed by an opening in the obturator membrane and contains the obturator artery and vein as well as the obturator nerve.
Which passage channel is formed by a fascial duplication of the M. obturatorius internus and which conduits run through it?
- The Alcock canal (canalis pudendalis) is a fascial duplication of the M. obturatorius internus, through which the pudendal nerve and the internal pudendal vessels pass.
Which structure serves as a counter-support (so-called Hypomochlion) for the M. obturatorius internus?
- A hypomochlion is a fulcrum or pivot point for the tendons of a muscle, over which their line of pull can be redirected. The lesser sciatic notch of the ischium serves as a hypomochlion for the M. obturatorius internus, which passes through the lesser sciatic foramen to the greater trochanter.
In which space of the pelvic cavity does the pudendal nerve give off the perineal nerves?
- The pudendal nerve enters the ischioanal fossa through the pudendal canal – a wedge-shaped space filled with fat and connective tissue in the posterior pelvic floor. There it divides into its terminal branches, including the perineal nerves which supply the skin and muscles of the perineum.
