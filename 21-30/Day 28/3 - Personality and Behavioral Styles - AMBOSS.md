# Personality and Behavioral Styles
## Summary

The personality of a person consists of many different components and characteristics. In the following, Eysenck's dimensions of personality as well as the Big-Five model will be presented. With regard to temporal stability, a distinction is made between temporally stable trait characteristics and temporally unstable state characteristics. Furthermore, a small selection of human behavioral styles will be explained in the following.
## Personality

### Theories of Personality

There are various theories of personality, of which two will be presented below. The model by Eysenck and the Big Five model as an integrative approach to previous research findings each describe characteristics of human beings that constitute their personality.

#### Eysenck's Dimensions of Personality (E-N-P-I)

Eysenck defines in his theory different dimensions of personality that are expressed to varying degrees in each individual.

|Acronym|Dimension|Specification|
|---|---|---|
|E|- Extraversion - Introversion|- Extroverted people are sociable and open<br>- Introverted people tend to seem reserved and distant|
|N|- Emotional Stability - Emotional Instability (Neuroticism)|- Emotionally stable people have a comparatively higher threshold for emotional arousal<br>- Emotionally unstable personalities are more easily disturbed, suffer more easily and frequently from anxiety disorders, as well as more frequently from mood swings and physical complaints as an expression of emotional stress|
|P|- Realism - Psychoticism|- People with pronounced psychoticism are often perceived as emotionally cold, aloof, and aggressive.<br>- People with pronounced realism are perceived as adaptable and can control their impulses well.|
|I|- Intelligence|- Has a rather secondary significance in Eysenck's model|

#### Big Five Model

The Big Five model was developed using various personality tests (including in non-Western cultures). The five personality traits that appeared most frequently across all these different settings were summarized as the "Big Five". The Big Five model is currently the most significant model of personality.

|Acronym|Dimension|Specification|
|---|---|---|
|V|- Agreeableness|- People with high agreeableness are perceived as compassionate, empathetic, understanding, and helpful<br>- People with low agreeableness are perceived as unfriendly, argumentative, self-centered, and competitive with others|
|O|- Openness to Experience|- People who are open to new experiences show interest in new things and are perceived as creative.<br>- People with lower levels of openness are more likely to be perceived as conservative.|
|G|- Conscientiousness|- Conscientious people exhibit a high level of responsibility; they are reliable and disciplined.<br>- People with lower conscientiousness are perceived as careless.|
|E|- Extra- vs. Introversion|- Corresponds to the dimensions of Eysenck's model|
|L|- Lability (Neuroticism) vs. Stability|

> [!NOTE]
> In twin studies, it has been found that personality traits are partly inherited and partly developed over the course of life. The genetic component accounts for an average of 45%, while the individual environment accounts for an average of 39%, whereas the shared environment (e.g., family size, standard of living) exerts only a comparatively small influence.

> [!NOTE]
> Conscientiousness correlates most strongly with higher education, better health behaviors, and lower mortality compared to the other traits of the Big Five model.

> [!NOTE]
> The five personality traits can be remembered with the acronym "BIRD" (Agreeableness, Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion vs. Introversion, and Neuroticism vs. Stability).

> [!NOTE] Factor analysis
> The different dimensions of personality can be measured using various personality tests. These usually consist of questionnaires in which different statements (e.g., "I generally feel rather uncomfortable in a foreign environment") are to be judged by the participant as "true" or "not true." Subsequently, the statements can be reduced to a few independent dimensions through a so-called factor analysis. For this purpose, statements that correlate strongly with each other are grouped together. For example, the statements "I generally feel rather uncomfortable in a foreign environment" and "I generally dislike speaking in front of a large group of people" are likely to be answered similarly by a participant, as they refer to the same aspect of their personality. From all the related statements, personality factors such as "introversion" can now be determined through statistical evaluation. All factors together ultimately form the personality structure, which can be represented using various models (e.g., Big Five Model).

### Temporal Stability of Personality Traits

Personality traits are relatively stable over time and thus differ from a person's moods, which are temporally unstable and dependent on situations. Therefore, a distinction is made between trait and state characteristics.

- Trait characteristics
    - Temporally stable personality traits
    - Can be regarded as a characteristic of a person
    - For example, anxious personality
- State Characteristics
    - Temporally unstable characteristics
    - Depend on the situation a person is in
    - For example, moods/mood swings; anxiety as a state in a threatening situation
    - State characteristics cannot be referred to as personality traits due to their temporal and situational instability.

### Self-Concept

The self-concept is the understanding that people have of themselves. It provides insight into how people see themselves or how they would like to be seen. It is relatively stable over time and shaped by the upbringing a person has experienced, their own desires about how they want to be, and the feedback from others about their personality. However, the self-concept often differs from the way others perceive them.

> [!NOTE] Personality Disorders
> Personality disorders are behavioral patterns that deviate significantly from the norms expected and accepted in a society. They are characterized by their resistance to influence and, therefore, are also difficult to treat. Treatment is only necessary when the distress for the person (and/or the environment) or the impairments in social and professional life become too severe. Depending on the behavior, different forms of personality disorder are distinguished, such as dependent, obsessive-compulsive, histrionic, and paranoid personality disorders.
> The general criteria for personality disorders include, among others:
> 
> - Subjective distress and impairments in social and professional life
> - Deeply rooted, inflexible behavior patterns concerning several areas
> - Begins in late childhood or adolescence

## Behavioral Styles

In psychology, various behavioral styles of humans are distinguished, of which a selection will be presented below.

- Field dependence: The influence of the environment on behavior.
- Interference tendency: People with this tendency are easily distracted by external, actually unimportant stimuli.
- Sensation Seeking: Refers to the desire for exciting sensory experiences and situations; these are often associated with risks (e.g. skydiving, drug use)
- Sensitization and Repression
    - Describes how people behave in response to unpleasant events; in clinical practice, it is particularly important to what extent they can tolerate threatening information.
        - Sensitization: Sensitizers tend to focus more on the unpleasant event and actively search for explanations and solutions.
        - Repression: Repressors deny, ignore, or downplay an unpleasant event.

> [!NOTE] Learned Helplessness (according to Seligman)
> The model of learned helplessness is a behavioral psychological basis for the development of depression and explains why those who are depressed are no longer able to cope with objectively controllable events. It refers to the phenomenon where living beings transfer the perceived helplessness of a seemingly hopeless situation (e.g., trauma, failure) to their general behavior.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Personality and Behavioral Styles
### Personality

Which personality traits belong to the “Big Five”?
- The personality traits of the Big Five model include: Agreeableness, Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion vs. Introversion, and Neuroticism vs. Stability (Mnemonic: VOGEL).
Which personality trait of the Big Five model is most strongly correlated with higher education, healthier behavior, and lower mortality? What characteristics define a person with a strong expression of this trait?
- The personality trait "Conscientiousness" correlates more strongly than the other traits of the Big Five model with higher education, better health behavior, and lower mortality. Conscientious people show a high level of responsibility and are reliable and disciplined.
What is neuroticism?
- Neuroticism is a personality trait of the Big Five model, also referred to as emotional instability. Neurotic individuals are emotionally unstable, have a lower threshold for arousal, are more easily disturbed, and suffer more often from mood swings and physical complaints than emotionally stable people.
How do extroverted and introverted people behave?
- Extraversion and Introversion are personality traits. Extroverted people are outgoing and open, introverted people tend to be reserved and distant.
What is the difference between so-called "trait" and "state" characteristics? Provide examples for each!
- Trait characteristics are personality traits of a person that are relatively stable over time and independent of situations and can thus be regarded as a general characteristic of a person (e.g., anxious personality). State characteristics, on the other hand, are temporally unstable, varying characteristics or situation-dependent states of a person (e.g., moods) and therefore are not personality traits.
What is a factor analysis and how is it used in personality tests?
- Factor analysis is a statistical method in which many items (e.g., statements in a questionnaire) are reduced to a few underlying factors. In personality tests, certain statements that correlate strongly with each other are grouped together (e.g., "I generally feel uncomfortable in an unfamiliar environment" and "I generally prefer not to speak in front of a large group" as the personality factor "Introversion"). All factors together ultimately form the personality structure, which can be represented using various models (e.g., Big Five model).
What is meant by a person's self-concept?
- People develop an approximately stable assumption about themselves ("Who am I?") over the course of their life. This is based, among other things, on upbringing, their own desires about how they want to be, as well as interaction with the environment. This assumption in its entirety is also referred to as the self-concept.
What are personality disorders? Name examples!
- Personality disorders are deep-rooted behavior patterns that clearly deviate from socially expected and accepted norms. For example, there are dependent, obsessive-compulsive, histrionic (from English histrionic = "theatrical", "affected"), and paranoid personality disorders. Therapy is only necessary when the distress for the affected person (and/or the environment) or the impairments in social and professional life become too severe.
### Behavioral Styles

What does Seligman's model of learned helplessness indicate, and in which mental disorder does it play a role?
- The model of learned helplessness describes the phenomenon that some people transfer the feeling of helplessness in a specific, seemingly hopeless life situation (e.g., illness) to their general behavior and develop the expectation that they will no longer be able to control or influence any future situations. The model forms the behavioral psychological basis for the development of depression and explains why affected individuals are no longer able to cope with objectively controllable events.
What is Sensation Seeking?
- Sensation Seeking describes a behavioral style based on the desire to expose oneself to stimulating, often risky situations (e.g., bungee jumping, reckless use of alcohol and drugs).
What characterizes the behavior of a sensitizer or a repressor, and to what extent do these behavioral styles play a role in clinical practice?
- The terms "Sensitization" and "Repression" describe how people behave towards unpleasant events. A sensitizer deals more with the unpleasant event and actively seeks explanations and solutions, while a repressor tends to deny, ignore, or downplay the situation. In clinical practice, these behavioral styles are especially relevant when conveying threatening information, as sensitizers may cope better with this but also have a higher need for information than repressors.
