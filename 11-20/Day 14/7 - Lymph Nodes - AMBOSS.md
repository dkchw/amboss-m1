# Lymph Nodes
## Summary

The bean-shaped lymph nodes have an important control function in the organism. As secondary lymphatic organs, they filter the entire lymph of the body and provide a defined space for immune defense, where the activation of lymphocytes takes place. They are located both centrally and peripherally, nearly everywhere scattered throughout the body. Their structure roughly corresponds to that of the other secondary lymphatic organs, with a cortical B-zone, a paracortical T-zone, and a hilum-adjacent medulla. Additionally, there is a pronounced sinus system through which the lymph flows. Clinically, there can be lymph node swelling in the context of infections, but also in the context of hematological and oncological diseases, which requires clarification if it persists.

- Size: A few millimeters to 1.5cm

### Form, Structure, and Topography

As small, bean-shaped organs, the lymph nodes are interposed in the lymphatic vascular system. The hilum is located on the concave side, where the efferent lymphatic vessel (vas efferens) exits the lymph node. Likewise, the inflowing and outflowing blood vessels enter and exit at this point. In contrast, the afferent lymphatic vessels (vasa afferentia) drain into the opposite convex side. The classification of lymph nodes can be done in two different ways.

- According to the direction of the flow: The classification of the lymph nodes is done from peripheral (i.e., organ-related) to central (up to the junction into the venous angle)
    - Primary (= regional) lymph nodes: They directly receive the lymph from a region and are thus the first filtering station of this area.
    - Secondary (collecting) lymph nodes: A group of lymph nodes that receives inflows from several primary lymph nodes and thus from multiple areas.
- According to the location of the organs: This allows for the differentiation between parietal (= wall-standing) and visceral (= organ-adjacent) groups of lymph nodes.
    - Parietal lymph nodes (Nll. parietales): Located in the abdomen and pelvis either around the large vessels or close to the body wall.
    - Visceral lymph nodes (Nll. viscerales): Are named organ-specifically and are primarily associated with the unpaired abdominal organs.
## Microscopic Anatomy

Each lymph node is surrounded by an organ capsule made of collagenous connective tissue. Extensions of the capsule, reticular connective tissue septa (trabeculae), extend radially into the interior of the lymph node with blood vessels, further subdividing the parenchyma into smaller compartments. The structural framework of the lymph node consists of reticular connective tissue in which the lymphocytes are embedded.

The parenchyma can be divided into cortex, paracortex, and medulla. Within the parenchyma, the activation of T and B lymphocytes as well as the antigen-dependent affinity maturation of B lymphocytes occurs. The B lymphocytes activated in the boundary area between the T and B cell zones (= primary focus) proliferate, with some differentiating into short-lived plasma cells that migrate to the medulla and produce IgM there. Another portion migrates into the primary follicles of the cortex and undergoes differentiation into late plasma cells (for more details see: affinity maturation).

- Yield (Cortex, B-Zone)
    - Location: Below the capsule and the lymph-filled marginal sinus (subcapsular)
    - Characteristics: Here, especially the primary and secondary lymph follicles with naive and activated B-lymphocytes are located.
    - Meaning: Site of B cell proliferation and differentiation
- Paracortex (T-Zone)
    - Location: Zone between the bark and the pith
    - Characteristics: Here, predominantly T-lymphocytes as well as high endothelial venules and interdigitating cells are located.
    - Meaning: Through the high endothelial venules, T-lymphocytes reach the paracortex and wait for their activation.
- Mark (Medulla)
    - Location: Hilusclose
    - Characteristics: Mark strands consist of filamentous arranged reticulum cells as well as short-lived plasma cells and macrophages.
    - Meaning: Here lie the early, short-lived plasma cells and macrophages that play an important role in the antigen-dependent affinity maturation of B lymphocytes.
- Lymph transport system (sinus system): The lymph nodes possess an extensive lymph transport system, in which lymphocytes and macrophages are also present.
    - Afferent vessels: Lymphatic vessels that penetrate the organ capsule.
    - Randsinus: Located subcapsularly
    - Intermediate sinus: Draw radially through the cortex and paracortex
    - Marksinus: Hilus near union of the intermediary sinuses
    - Efferent vessel or efferent vessels: Individual or few draining lymphatic vessels
## Blood Supply and Lymphatic System

- Blood supply
    - Arterial
        - The supplying arterial vessels reach the lymph node through the hilum.
        - Branching only in the cortex into a wide capillary network
    - Venous: Venous capillary network → Transition in the paracortex to the post-capillary high-endothelial venules → Exit of the draining vein through the hilum
- Lymphatic system
    - Lymph flow: Numerous afferent vessels that penetrate the organ capsule lead the lymph to the subcapsular marginal sinus → From there, intermediate sinuses radiate through the cortex and paracortex, connecting near the hilum to the medullary sinus → Through the efferent vessel, lymph and lymphocytes leave the lymph node
## Function

As secondary lymphatic organs, the lymph nodes are part of the sentinel organs of the immune system. Under physiological conditions, they have the following functions:

- "Filter station" of the lymphatic system: Macrophages within the lymph node phagocytize bacteria, virus-infected cells, malignant degenerated cells, and foreign particles.
- Activation of the immune system: Antigen presentation followed by activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B and T lymphocytes (For more details, see: Specific immune system)

> [!NOTE] Lymph node metastases
> Some malignant tumors already form lymph node metastases at an early stage. This involves the spread of malignant cells from the primary tumor through the lymphatic system to the lymph nodes. This can drastically change the prognosis and therapeutic approach. In many tumor surgeries, such as in breast cancer, an examination of the sentinel lymph nodes is therefore performed beforehand. For this purpose, technetium-labeled protein is injected into the malignant environment, which accumulates in the draining lymph node and can then be detected intraoperatively with a measuring probe. This allows the sentinel lymph node to be identified and removed for frozen section analysis. Depending on whether the lymph node is affected, the surgical therapy can then be individually adapted.

> [!NOTE] Lymph node swelling
> The lymph nodes are the "filter stations" of the lymphatic system and are involved in the activation of the immune system. Lymph node swelling is primarily found in the context of inflammation as well as in malignant diseases. Therefore, when a patient presents with lymph node swelling, it is essential to distinguish between these two causes: Benign causes are indeed much more common, but malignant causes must always be considered due to their serious consequences. In this context, the clinical examination plays the most important role. If a lymph node is acutely painful and enlarged and there are signs of a local or systemic infection, this is more indicative of an infectious/benign lymph node swelling. In the case of a painless, progressive lymph node swelling, a malignant process should be considered. Further diagnostics (e.g., serologies, imaging) are indicated in cases of uncertainty regarding the diagnosis and therapeutic consequences. If malignancy cannot be definitively ruled out, excision and histological examination of the affected lymph node(s) must be performed.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Lymph Nodes
### Microscopic Anatomy

Describe the basic structure of a lymph node!
- Lymph nodes have an organ capsule made of collagenous connective tissue, whose extensions as connective tissue septa with blood vessels radiate into the interior of the lymph node. The framework of lymph nodes consists of reticular connective tissue, into which lymphocytes are embedded. The parenchyma can be divided into cortex, paracortex, and medulla.
How is the paracortex of lymph nodes structured?
- The paracortex of lymph nodes lies between the cortex and medulla. It mainly contains T lymphocytes, which reach the paracortex via high endothelial venules and wait there for their activation. Therefore, the paracortex is considered the T-zone of the lymph nodes.
How is the cortex of lymph nodes structured?
- The cortex of lymph nodes lies beneath the capsule and the lymph-filled marginal sinus (subcapsular). It mainly contains the primary and secondary lymph follicles with naive and activated B lymphocytes. Therefore, the cortex is considered the B-zone of the lymph nodes.
