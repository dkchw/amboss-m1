# Smooth Muscle

## Summary

The uniqueness of muscle tissue is its ability to generate force and move body parts. This is made possible by the contractile myofilaments actin and myosin, which can shift against each other. Based on the intracellular arrangement of these myofilaments, muscle tissue is divided into striated (skeletal and cardiac muscle) and smooth muscle (e.g., in the intestine). The molecular interaction of the contractile filaments differs little among the various muscle types (sliding filament theory), whereas the function varies greatly.

The functions of smooth muscle are diverse, as it occurs in many organs. The smooth muscle of the intestine is responsible, for example, for the transport of food bolus, whereas the smooth muscle of blood vessels is primarily responsible for vascular resistance in the circulation.

## Structure

Smooth muscle can be stimulated to contract not only by electrical but also, for example, by chemical and metabolic stimuli. Unlike skeletal muscle, it is not controlled consciously (by α-motor neurons), but rather unconsciously. For the exact structure of the myofilaments actin and myosin, see: Fundamentals of Muscle Tissue.

### The smooth muscle cell

- Cell morphology: Small spindle-shaped cell with only one nucleus
- Sarkolemmeinstülpungen: Caveolae with a lot of Caveolin
    - Function
        - Uptake of Ca2+ from the extracellular space into the cell interior (pinocytosis)
        - Transmission of mechanical stimuli to the cell (Mechanotransduction)
- Calcium storage: Weakly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum without L-tubules
- Myofilaments
    - Arrangement
        - Actin and myosin filaments run "unordered" in all directions through the sarcoplasm
        - No formation of sarcomeres
    - Activation
        - Light myosin chains in smooth muscle must be phosphorylated to interact with actin (by the so-called myosin light chain kinase)
        - Calcium binds to calmodulin in smooth muscle for the interaction of myofilaments.
    - Anchoring: In so-called Dense Bodies
    - Networking: Dense bodies are connected to each other by intermediate filaments (e.g., desmin, vimentin)

## Contraction

### Electro- and pharmacomechanical coupling

The development of force through the interaction of actin and myosin works in smooth muscle and skeletal muscle according to the same principle and is illustrated in the fundamentals of muscle tissue (see: filament sliding theory). There are only differences in the electromechanical coupling and the processes at the myosin filaments (phosphorylation).

- Definition: Conversion of various stimuli (e.g. action potentials or hormones) into a mechanical muscle contraction
- Process
    1. Stimulus opens calcium channels in the sarcolemma → Calcium influx into the smooth muscle cell from the extracellular space → Intracellular calcium concentration↑↑ (from <10-7mol/l to >10-6mol/l)
    2. Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (via phospholipase C and IP3) → Intracellular calcium concentration↑
    3. Calcium binds to Calmodulin in the sarcoplasm, activating it.
    4. Calcium-calmodulin complex activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)
5. Myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates the light chain of the myosin filament.
    6. Phosphorylated myosin has ATPase activity → Interacts with actin → Contraction (see: sliding filament theory)

> [!NOTE]
> In smooth muscle, the actin-myosin interaction is regulated both at the myosin filament (phosphorylation) and at the actin filament (blocking of binding sites)!

> [!NOTE]
> In smooth muscle, the influx of calcium from the extracellular space significantly contributes to the increase in intracellular calcium concentration! In cardiac muscle, however, it serves only as a trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum!

> [!NOTE]
> In smooth muscle, calcium binds to calmodulin, whereas in skeletal muscle, calcium binds to troponin C!

> [!NOTE]
> The shifting of the filaments and the ATP hydrolysis by myosin ATPase occur 100 to 1000 times slower than in skeletal muscle, thus the maximum shortening velocity of smooth muscle is significantly lower!

### Termination of the Contraction

- Principle: Myosin must either be dephosphorylated and/or less phosphorylated.
- Mechanisms
    1. When the intracellular calcium concentration decreases, the activity of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) predominates.
        - Causes
            - Ca2+ ions are pumped into the extracellular space and partially into the sarcoplasmic reticulum via various transporters (e.g., Ca2+-ATPases or Na+-Ca2+ exchangers)
            - Hyperpolarization of the cell membrane (e.g., through the opening of potassium channels) → Opening of voltage-gated calcium channels is prevented → Further calcium influx into the cell is stopped
        - Function: Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated myosin
        - Effect: Dephosphorylated myosin no longer interacts with actin → Contraction is terminated
    2. Activation of myosin light chain phosphatase by nitric oxide (NO) or cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG) as well as by cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA)
        - Rho-kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) inhibit myosin light chain phosphatase, lead to Ca2+ sensitization, and thereby prevent the termination of contraction.
    3. Inhibition of myosin light chain kinase by an increase in intracellular cAMP and cGMP (e.g., through β2 innervation or binding of NO)

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the myosin heads of smooth muscle do not detach from actin after the formation of cross-bridges. This creates a sustained tonic contraction with low ATP and O2 consumption!

### Tone Regulation and Action Potential Forms

The tone of smooth muscle can be regulated in various ways, which differ from organ to organ. In principle, it is influenced by the autonomic nervous system (neurogenic), by muscle-specific mechanisms (myogenic), and by environmental factors. An action potential does not necessarily have to occur to trigger a contraction. However, if an action potential does occur, it is distinctly different from the action potentials of skeletal muscle.

- Regulation of muscle tone
    1. Myogen
        - Pacemaker cells: Especially single-unit cells can be stimulated by pacemaker cells to a self-sustaining rhythm (so-called myogenic tone) (e.g. peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract)
        - Mechanical stimuli (e.g., stretching)
    2. Neurogen: Vegetative nerve endings release neurotransmitters (acetylcholine or norepinephrine) near smooth muscles.
    3. Through environmental factors
        - Metabolic stimuli (pH value, O2)
        - Hormone (e.g., NO, Adrenaline, Histamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin)
- Possible forms of action potential
    - Spike-Potentials: They resemble the action potentials of skeletal muscle, but are 50 times slower.
    - Action potentials with a plateau: Action potentials that stimulate muscles for prolonged contraction (e.g., in the uterus or ureter)
    - Slow-wave potentials: Slow potential fluctuations based on pacemaker cells that lead to action potentials and thus rhythmic contractions at regular intervals (e.g., peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract)

> [!NOTE]
> In the contraction of smooth muscle, there is no all-or-nothing principle. The increasing depolarization of the smooth muscle cell leads to an increasing contraction through an increasing influx of calcium!

> [!NOTE]
> In smooth muscle, there are no motor end plates!

> [!NOTE] Paralytic ileus
> The intestinal content is transported further by rhythmic contractions of the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal system (peristalsis). When the intestinal content is at a standstill, this is referred to as ileus. In this case, a distinction is made between whether the intestinal passage is interrupted due to a mechanical obstruction (so-called mechanical ileus) or due to a "paralysis" of the smooth intestinal muscles (so-called paralytic ileus). The paralysis of the smooth muscles can have many causes, such as the blockage of mesenteric vessels. Ileus is an acutely life-threatening condition that should be treated as quickly as possible!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Smooth Muscle
### Structure

What is referred to as so-called caveolae?
- The so-called caveolae are numerous invaginations in the cell membrane of smooth muscle cells that serve the uptake of Ca2+ from the extracellular space as well as the transduction of mechanical stimuli. The supporting framework of the caveolae is formed by caveolin (the most common membrane protein in the area of the caveolae).

What do the Ca2+ ions bind to during the activation of smooth muscle cells?
- When smooth muscle cells are activated, cytosolic Ca2+ ions bind to calmodulin, which frees the actin-binding sites of the myofilaments (through the so-called myosin light chain kinase), and subsequently myosin and actin can interact.

What distinguishes smooth muscle cell assemblies from single-unit and multi-unit types?
- Smooth muscle cell assemblies of the single-unit type consist of many individual smooth muscle cells that are connected to each other by numerous gap junctions and contract together as a functional unit (the so-called functional syncytium). In contrast, the smooth multi-unit cells behave like many individual muscle cells that can contract independently.

### Contraction

Describe the processes involved in electro- and pharmacomechanical coupling in smooth muscle cells!
- Through electro- and pharmacomechanical coupling in smooth muscle cells, stimuli (e.g., action potentials, hormones) can be converted into mechanical muscle contraction. As a result of the stimulus, Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane (here: sarcolemma) are initially opened, allowing Ca2+ ions to flow in. The rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration causes a release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol (via phospholipase C and IP3). The Ca2+ ions bind to calmodulin in the sarcoplasm, activating it. The calcium-calmodulin complex, in turn, activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which phosphorylates the light chain of the myosin filament. The phosphorylated myosin can interact with actin through ATPase activity, which ultimately leads to contraction.

How is the contraction of smooth muscle terminated?
- To terminate the contraction, myosin must either be dephosphorylated and/or phosphorylated to a lesser extent. For this, either myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) must be activated and/or myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibited. There are three mechanisms for this: 1. MLCP can be activated by a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration (hyperpolarization of the cell membrane prevents opening of voltage-activated calcium channels, transport of Ca2+ ions into the extracellular space and partly back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum); 2. MLCP can be activated by nitric oxide (NO) or cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG); 3. MLCK can be inhibited by an increase in intracellular cAMP and cGMP (e.g., through β2 innervation or binding of NO), so that less myosin is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylated myosin no longer interacts with actin and the contraction ends.

What statement can be made about the speed of contraction of smooth muscle cells?
- The maximum shortening speed of smooth muscle is significantly slower than that of skeletal muscle (because the sliding of the filaments and ATP hydrolysis by myosin ATPase take about 100–1000 times longer).
