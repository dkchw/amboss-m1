# General Anatomy
## Summary

To orient oneself on the body and to communicate uniformly about bodily findings in clinical spoken and written language, a certain foundational knowledge of anatomy is necessary. To ensure this, several defined axes and planes on the body are distinguished, which can help, for example, to describe the localization of an organ change due to disease more clearly.

The joints of the musculoskeletal system are divided into true joints (diarthroses) with a joint cavity and generally high mobility, and into false joints (synarthroses) without a joint cavity and usually with only a limited range of motion.

The auxiliary structures of the skeletal muscles are also part of the fundamentals of the anatomy of the musculoskeletal system. This refers to recurring structures in muscles and in the vicinity of joints that are intended to maximize force transmission (e.g., hypomochlion) or minimize movement friction (e.g., bursa).

## Axes and Planes

In this section, the terms of body axes and planes are presented, which are needed for orientation on the body.

### Body Axes

|Main Axes|   |Definition|
|---|---|---|
|Longitudinal axis|   |Runs in a cranial-caudal direction|
|Sagittal axis|   |Runs in a ventral-dorsal direction|
|Transversal axis|   |Runs in the left-right direction|

### Body Planes

1. Frontal plane (coronal plane or coronal plane)
    - Definition: Plane parallel to the forehead (from Latin "frons")
    - Divides the body into: Ventral and dorsal parts
    - Example: The scapula is positioned in a normal position in a frontal plane.
2. Sagittal plane
    - Definition: Plane running parallel to the sagittal suture
        - Special form: Midsagittal plane (Median plane)
    - Divides the body into: Left and right portions
    - Example
        - The ears are each located in a sagittal plane.
        - The pubic symphysis lies exactly in the median sagittal plane.
3. Transversal plane
    - Definition: Horizontal cross-section in a standing person
    - Divides the body into: cranial and caudal parts
    - Example: The soles of the feet are located in a transverse plane when a person is standing.

Body planes in computed tomography
Another illustrative example of body planes is computed tomography (CT scan): The images obtained via CT are preferably evaluated in the form of transverse sections. However, the acquired image data can also be displayed in a frontal plane or sagittal plane if needed. This way, the optimal plane for evaluation can be utilized.

## Overview of Joint Types

The bones provide the body structure with the necessary stability. At the same time, however, there must be transitions between adjacent bone ends that allow for defined movements. These connections are the joints, which can be classified into two forms based on their structure.

1. Diarthroses (true joints)
2. Synarthroses (false joints)

### Differences between Diarthroses and Synarthroses

| |Diarthrosis|Synarthrosis|
|---|---|---|
|Type of bone connection|- Discontinuous|- Continuous|
|Joint space with joint cavity|- Present|- Not present|
|Movement possibility|- Basically high<br>- Exception: Amphiarthrosis (tight true joint)|- Very low|

> [!NOTE] Pseudarthrosis
> As pseudarthrosis refers to a so-called false joint. It occurs after insufficient fracture healing, when the two ends of the fracture do not adequately fuse together through new bone tissue. Possible causes for this are inadequate immobilization, displaced (shifted against each other) fracture ends, or an infection in the area of the fracture. The resulting pseudarthrosis is characterized by instability with permanent functional impairment and chronic pain. Therapeutically, either foreign material in the form of metal plates or screws (so-called osteosynthesis) is used, or the body's own bone tissue, often taken from the iliac crest, is removed and placed in the bone gap (so-called spongiosaplasty).

## Diarthroses (true joints)

### Structure of Diarthroses (true joints)

|Components|   |Definition|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|Joint body|Joint head (Caput articulare)|- Approximately convex-shaped bone end involved in joint formation|- Shape of the joint body assists in guiding a joint movement with|
|Glenoid cavity (Fossa articularis)|- An nearly concave-shaped end of a bone that is involved in joint formation but is less mobile than the joint head|
|Articular surface (Facies articularis)|   |- Contact surface of the articulating bones covered with articular cartilage|- The articulating bones are connected through the articular surfaces|
|Articular cartilage (Cartilago articularis)|   |- Layer of hyaline cartilage that covers the joint surfaces|- Allows for low-friction sliding and rotational movements in the joint<br>- The compressibility of the cartilage protects the subchondral bone from mechanical stress|
|Joint space|   |- A few tenths of a millimeter wide space between articulating bones, filled with joint fluid (synovia)|- Allows for the movement of the bones relative to one another|
|Joint capsule (Capsula articularis)|   |- See: Structure of a joint capsule|- Closure of the joint space to the outside, creating a closed joint cavity<br>- Formation of joint fluid (synovial fluid) by the mucous membrane of the joint capsule|
|Joint cavity (Cavitas articularis)|   |- A space completely sealed off on the outside by the joint capsule, in which the articulating bone ends lie|- Allows for unobstructed sliding and rotational movements as a closed-off space|
|Joint fluid (synovia)|   |- Viscous, clear fluid within the joint cavity, produced by the synoviocytes of the joint capsule|- Reduces the friction forces that arise between the joint surfaces during movement<br>- Nourishes the bradytrophic cartilage tissue|

> [!NOTE]
> The articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage! There are only two exceptions to this: The articular surfaces of the temporomandibular joint and the sternoclavicular joint are covered by fibrocartilage!

#### Structure of a Joint Capsule

- Fibrous membrane
    - Outer layer of the joint capsule
    - Consists of dense connective tissue (partly reinforced with ligaments)
- Synovial membrane
    - Lining the inner side of the joint capsule
    - Consists of intima and subintima
    - Contains synoviocytes that produce proteins and glycosaminoglycans (including hyaluronan) and clean the joint cavity.
        - A-Cells = Macrophages
        - B cells = Specialized fibroblasts

The synovialis is the articular membrane on the inner side of the joint capsule. The synovia, on the other hand, is the joint fluid produced by the cells of the synovialis!

### Special Joint Types

|Joint Type|   |Definition|Range of Motion|   |Example Joints|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Flat Joint<br><br>(Articulatio plana)|   |- Form of diarthrosis with flat (planar) joint surfaces|- Depending on the ligamentous apparatus, possible: rotation and/or translational movement|- Patellofemoral joint (Art. femoropatellaris)<br>- Intervertebral joints (Artt. zygapophyseales)|   |
|Stiff Joint (Amphiarthrosis)|   |- A form of diarthrosis with uneven joint surfaces, which has little mobility due to tight ligaments and a tight joint capsule|- Depending on the ligament apparatus, slight translational movements are possible|   |- Tibiofibular joint (Art. tibiofibularis)<br>- Sacroiliac joint (Art. sacroiliaca)<br>- Wrist joints (Artt. intercarpales and Artt. carpometacarpales)<br>- Ankle joint|

## Synarthroses (false joints)

Depending on the type of tissue from which the bone connection is made, four types of synarthroses can be distinguished: syndesmosis, synchondrosis, symphysis, and synostosis.

|Synarthrosis Type|Definition|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Syndesmosis (Ligamentous Joint)|Bone connection made of connective tissue|- Fontanelles of the skull<br>- Gomphosis (Peg-in-socket)<br>- Vertebral body connections: Lig. flavum, Lig. interspinale, Lig. supraspinale<br>- Membrana interossea antebrachii (in the forearm) and Membrana interossea cruris (in the lower leg)<br>- Syndesmosis tibiofibularis (connection between distal tibia and distal fibula)|
|Synchondrosis|Bone connection made of hyaline cartilage|- Costal cartilage (Synchondrosis sternocostalis)<br>- Growth plates during bone growth|
|Symphysis (special form of synchondrosis)|Bone connection made of fibrocartilage|- Pubic symphysis (symphysis pubica)<br>- Intervertebral discs (disci intervertebrales)|
|Synostosis (bony fusion)|Bony connection| - Sacrum (Os sacrum)<br>- Ossified (i.e., closed) growth plates|

## Supportive Structures of Skeletal Muscle

This section deals with the additional structures that occur in skeletal muscle, in order to minimize movement friction on one hand and maximize force transmission on the other.

### Tendon (Tendon)

- Definition: Connective tissue connection between muscle and bone tissue
- Function: Transfer of muscle strength to the skeleton or another muscle belly
- Components
    - Cells: Tenocytes
    - Matrix: Parallel collagen fibers, few elastic fibers
    - Enveloping structures
        - Epitendineum: Loose connective tissue that surrounds the entire tendon.
        - Peritendineum: Loose connective tissue septa that radiate from the epitendineum into the center of the tendon and subdivide it into fiber bundles.
            - In these septa run, among other things, nerves and vessels
    - Muscle-tendon connection
        - The sarcolemma is strongly folded in the area of the tendon insertion (significant surface enlargement!)
        - Collagen fibers of the tendon attach to the basal lamina of the muscle cell in the area of the folding.
        - Actin of the terminal sarcomere (intracellular) is connected through a dystrophin-glycoprotein complex with the collagen fibers of the tendon (extracellular) (force transmission!)
- Classification by
    - Localization: Origin tendon (Origo) vs. Insertion tendon (Insertio)
    - Functions: Glide tendon vs. Pull tendon

> [!NOTE]
> Flat tendons are called aponeuroses!

### Bursae (Synovial Bursa)

Bursae are pressure-elastic cushions filled with synovial fluid. They are located between bony prominences and tendons and serve to facilitate smooth gliding and cushioning. For details, see also: synovial bursa in the section "Structure of Diarthroses."

The lining of bursae and tendon sheaths (in the synovial cavity) corresponds to the structure of the synovial membrane of the joint capsule!

### Tendon Sheath (Vagina Tendinis)

- Definition: Tubular, connective tissue sheathing of long tendons
- Function: Provides long tendons with a low-friction guide rail for gliding
- Structure: Similar in structure to a bursa that is wrapped around a tendon.
    - Stratum fibrosum: Consists of collagenous connective tissue and anchors the tendon sheath in the surrounding area (e.g., in the bone)
    - Synovial layer: Forms a "cushion" filled with synovia with two layers that wraps around the tendon, creating a kind of tunnel in which the tendon can glide.
        - Parietal layer: Forms the outer shell of the "cushion" filled with synovia and is connected to the fibrous layer.
        - Visceral layer: It lies directly against the tendon and folds into the parietal layer at the mesotendineum (thus forming the synovial-filled gap of the tendon sheath)
    - Mesotendineum: Connecting structure between the parietal and visceral layer, through which vessels and nerves are conducted to the tendon.

> [!NOTE] Tendon sheath inflammation (tendovaginitis)
> Tendon sheaths can be irritated and become inflamed due to repetitive and monotonous movements, a condition known as tenosynovitis. This often occurs as a result of repeated movements, such as finger movements during computer work. Tenosynovitis in the wrist area usually manifests as local swelling and painful crunching and grinding when moving the tendon. The affected muscles should be rested and immobilized as much as possible. If this is not sufficient, the inflammatory response can be treated with glucocorticoids, and the affected tendon sheath can be surgically split.

### Abutment (Hypomochlion)

The direction of pull of a tendon can be altered by a counter-bearing (so-called hypomochlion). This can involve both bony structures (e.g., the patella) and ligamentous structures. The redirected tendons are glide tendons, as their direction of pull does not correspond to the direction of their associated muscle.

- Retinakulum
    - Definition: Band-like structure for the fixation or redirecting of long flexor and extensor tendons at the bone (e.g., at the transition to the hand)
    - Function: Deflection of the pulling direction of tendons
- Sesambein (Sesamoid bone)
    - Definition: Bony structures around which tendons are redirected or that are incorporated into tendons (e.g. patella)
    - Functions
        - Deflection of the pulling direction of tendons
        - Improvement of the leverage of tendons (→ Reduced effort required)

### Muscle fascia

- Definition: Outermost envelope structure made of collagenous connective tissue that surrounds individual muscles or entire muscle groups like a sock.
- Function: Primarily serves as a separating sliding layer against the environment
- Types
    - Single fascia: Fascia surrounds only a single muscle or muscle belly
    - Fascia profunda: Envelops a group of related muscles, thus forming a so-called muscle compartment.
    - Body fascia (superficial fascia): Envelopes all muscle surfaces of the body, with the exception of some facial muscles.

> [!NOTE] Compartment syndrome
> If, for example, a blunt trauma to the lower leg occurs as a result of a traffic accident, this can lead to bleeding in the muscle compartments of the lower leg. In the case of a closed injury, the blood cannot drain from the muscle compartment, causing the pressure within it to continually rise. Due to the increasing tissue pressure, the exchange of substances decreases (Starling's formula), resulting in an inadequate supply to the structures within the muscle compartment. If the fascia is not split within a few hours, the muscles and nerves contained within it will suffer irreversible damage!

## Review Questions on the Chapter General Anatomy
### Axes and Planes

What is the so-called "median sagittal plane"? Name an anatomical structure that is intersected by it!
- The sagittal plane is the body plane running parallel to the sagittal suture of the skull. The median sagittal plane is the sagittal plane that divides the body exactly in the middle, creating equal left and right halves. It intersects, for example, the symphysis pubis.

### Diarthroses (true joints)

What type of joint is the distal radioulnar joint? Name another example of this type of joint!
- The distal radioulnar joint is a so-called pivot joint, which allows pronation and supination. Other examples of this joint type are the proximal radioulnar joint as well as the lower atlantoaxial joint (Art. atlantoaxialis).

What type of joint is the sacroiliac joint? Name another example of this joint type!
- The sacroiliac joint (Articulatio sacroiliaca) is a true joint between the ilium bone and the sacrum, but due to tight ligaments and a tight joint capsule, it has little range of motion. It is therefore classified as a syndesmosis (amphiarthrosis). Another example of this joint type is the intercarpal joints between the wrist bones.

How is a joint capsule structured?
- A joint capsule consists of two layers: The outer layer (membrana fibrosa) is made of dense connective tissue, which is partly reinforced by ligaments (e.g., cruciate ligaments of the knee); the inner layer (membrana synovialis) consists of an intima and a subintima and contains synoviocytes that produce proteins as well as glycosaminoglycans (including hyaluronan) and clean the joint cavity.

### Synarthroses (false joints)

What type of joint is the connection between the distal tibia and distal fibula? Name another example of this joint type!
- The tibia and fibula at their distal ends are connected by dense collagenous connective tissue. This type of joint connection is called a syndesmosis (ligamentous joint) and belongs to the false joints (synarthroses). Another example of a syndesmosis is the interosseous membrane of the forearm (membrana interossea antebrachii) between the ulna and radius.

What is a symphysis? Name two examples!
- A symphysis is a false joint in which the involved bones are connected by fibrocartilage. Typical examples are the pubic symphysis (symphysis pubica) and the intervertebral discs (disci intervertebrales).

### Supportive Structures of Skeletal Muscle

Describe the histological structure of a tendon and the muscle-tendon connection!
- Tendons are connective tissue links between muscle and bone tissue. They consist of specialized cells (triangular tendinocytes), a matrix with primarily parallel collagen fibers, and surrounding structures. Collagen fibrils interweave with the basal lamina of the muscle cell in the muscle-tendon transition and thus ensure a firm connection. The surface of the muscle cells in this area is also greatly enlarged by invaginations.
