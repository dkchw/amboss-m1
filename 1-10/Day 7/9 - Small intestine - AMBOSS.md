# Small intestine
## Summary

The small intestine (intestinum tenue) is approximately 3–6 meters long, depending on the state of contraction, and extends from the pylorus to the ileal orifice. It consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Enzymatic breakdown and absorption of food take place in the small intestine. The structure of the wall corresponds in its basic structure to the layers of the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. However, there are some special features on the surface of the mucosa that serve to increase the surface area. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on the small and large intestine in the section on histological features.

## Histological Features of the Small Intestine

The small intestine exhibits a typical layering for the digestive tract consisting of the tunica mucosa, tela submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica adventitia (in retroperitoneal location) or tunica serosa (in intraperitoneal location) (see chapter Overview of the Digestive System). However, there is a special surface structure that serves to increase the surface area. The reason for this is that all absorption processes take place in the small intestine, and thus the absorption area must be very large.

### Microscopic Features for the Surface Enlargement of the Small Intestine

- Circular folds (Kerckring folds): Transversely oriented mucosal folds that are visible to the naked eye.
    - Size: Up to 1 cm high
    - Components: Mucous membrane and submucosal layer
- Villus (Intestinal villi): Sit on the circular folds
    - Size: 0.2–1 mm high
    - Components
        - Epithelial layer of the mucosa
        - Lamina propria mucosae
        - Zottenstroma
            - Smooth muscle cells
            - Defense cells
            - Lymph capillaries (chyle vessels)
            - Central venule through which blood is directed towards the portal vein
            - Several arterioles that transition into a capillary network at the villous tip
    - Cells: Electrical coupling through gap junctions
        - Enterocytes: Responsible for absorption
            - Most common cell type
            - The apical membrane has special structures.
                - Microvilli for increasing surface area
                - Wide glycocalyx for protection
                - Numerous enzymes for the breakdown of carbohydrates and peptides
        - Goblet cells: Secretion of mucus
- Crypts (Crypts of Lieberkühn): Are located between the villi at their base.
    - Size: 0.2–0.4 mm deep
    - Components: Mucous membrane
    - Cells
        - Paneth cells: Part of the nonspecific immune defense
            - Your presence increases from oral to aboral: In the duodenum, they are hardly found.
            - Located at the base of the Lieberkühn crypts mainly in the jejunum and ileum
            - Function: Secretion of Lysozyme and α-Defensin
        - Enteroendocrine Cells
        - Stem cells
            - The cells of the small intestinal epithelium live for only about 5 days.
            - Multipotent stem cells ensure a continuous supply of cell replacement
- Microvilli (Brush border)

> [!NOTE]
> The Kerckring folds are constant; they do not fade (unlike the folds of the stomach) even when the intestinal wall is stretched!

## Duodenum

The duodenum (first part of the small intestine) connects to the stomach and is primarily responsible for neutralizing the acidic chyme from the stomach. It is C-shaped and is divided into four parts. The ducts from the pancreas and liver open into the duodenum.

### Macroscopic Anatomy of the Duodenum

#### Profile

- Function: Neutralization of gastric juice and absorption of food
- Location
    - Superior part: Intraperitoneal
    - Descending part, Horizontal part, and Ascending part: Secondarily retroperitoneal
- Shape: C-shaped
- Length: Approximately 25 cm

#### Structure and Topography of the Duodenum

The duodenum is divided into four sections. Along these sections, the lumen narrows from about 4.7 cm to approximately 2.7 cm. The duodenum is shaped like a C around the head of the pancreas, with the superior part located at the level of the first lumbar vertebra and the horizontal part at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. In a way, the duodenum encircles the second lumbar vertebra.

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Duodenum

In the area of the duodenum, the vascular territories of the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery anastomose and supply the duodenum. The veins follow the arteries and are named accordingly. The duodenum is innervated by the enteric nervous system as well as by parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers.

> [!NOTE]
> The two superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries anastomose in the area of the pancreatic head with the anterior and posterior branches of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, thus forming a dual vascular loop!

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Duodenum

In addition to the general characteristics of the small intestine mucosa, there are two further properties that are characteristic of the duodenum.

#### Regional Characteristics of the Duodenum

1. Brunner's glands (Glandulae duodenales): Mucous, tubuloalveolar glands
    - Located in the tela submucosa
    - Their secretory parts traverse the lamina muscularis mucosae before they open into the crypts.
    - Secretion of mucus, bicarbonate, amylase, maltase
    - Stimulation by secretin
2. No Kerckring folds at the beginning of the duodenum (bulbus duodeni)

### Function of the Duodenum

The duodenum neutralizes the acidic chyme from the stomach. This occurs through the secretions from the liver, the pancreas, and the Brunner's glands. In the neutral environment, the digestive enzymes can then begin breaking down the food.

1. The acidic chyme passes from the stomach into the duodenum.
2. Mixing of various secretions and neutralization of the chyme
    - The alkaline secret from the pancreas reaches the duodenum via the pancreatic duct.
    - Through the common bile duct, the alkaline secretion of the liver reaches the duodenum.
    - The Brunner's glands of the duodenum secrete bicarbonate, mucus, amylase, and maltase.
    - Water addition (especially osmotically in hyperosmolar chyme)
3. In the neutral environment, the digestive enzymes can begin the breakdown of food.

### Development of the Duodenum
[[1 - Overview of the Digestive System - AMBOSS]]
### Jejunum and Ileum

The jejunum (empty intestine) connects at the duodenojejunalis flexure to the duodenum and continues distally without a clear boundary into the ileum (curved intestine). In these sections of the intestine, the enzymatic breakdown, mixing, and absorption of food components are continued. At the ileal orifice, the small intestine ends and the ileum transitions into the cecum.

### Macroscopic Anatomy

#### Profile

- Function: Absorption, enzymatic breakdown, and mixing of food
- Location: Intraperitoneal
- Form: Tube-shaped coiled
- Length: 3–5 m

#### Structure

- The jejunum emerges from the duodenum at the duodenojejunalis flexure.
- Transition into the ileum without direct limitation
- The ileum ends at the ileal orifice.
    - Small opening in the wall of the cecum
    - Enclosed by the Bauhin's valve (syn. ileocecal valve)
    - Separates the ileum from the cecum.

#### Topography

Both the jejunum and the ileum are located intraperitoneally. Both sections consist of numerous loops that are anchored to the dorsal abdominal wall at the level of LWK 3–4 via the radix mesenterii (attachment point of the mesentery). However, the individual loops of the small intestine are movable relative to one another.

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation

The arterial supply of the jejunum and ileum comes from vessels that originate from the superior mesenteric artery. Like all other parts of the intestinal tract, these sections are supplied by the autonomously functioning enteric nervous system. There is also a sympathetic and a parasympathetic supply.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- Jejunal arteries from the superior mesenteric artery<br>- Ileal arteries from the superior mesenteric artery|
|Venous|- Superior mesenteric vein into the portal vein|
|Innervation|   |
|Sympathetic|- Superior mesenteric ganglion (fibers from the lesser splanchnic nerve)|
|Parasympathetic|- Posterior vagal trunk|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes| - Juxtaintestinal lymph nodes|

> [!NOTE]
> The two arteries form vascular arcades, ensuring continuous blood flow even with movements of the small intestine!

> [!NOTE] Mesenteric infarction
> In the case of a narrowing of the mesenteric vessels (e.g., due to arteriosclerosis or an external tumor), there are typically recurring, dull abdominal pains following a meal. If a mesenteric vessel is completely occluded, it is referred to as a so-called mesenteric infarction. This is a highly dangerous medical condition that follows a typical staged progression: In the initial stage lasting about six hours, the patient complains of severe (ischemia-related) abdominal pain, which is usually followed by a symptom-poor phase of "false peace," during which a transmural peritonitis develops after the bowel dies. In the late stage (>12 h), an acute abdomen develops with unbearable pain, bloody diarrhea, and paralytic ileus. In the case of acute mesenteric infarction, rapid action is indicated, as the ischemia tolerance of the bowel is about six hours. Therefore, any suspicion should be promptly confirmed or excluded through imaging procedures – a mesenteric artery infarction represents an absolute surgical emergency indication and has a poor prognosis even with rapid treatment!

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Jejunum and Ileum

In addition to the general histological characteristics of the small intestine, there are other properties that are characteristic of the jejunum and ileum. Above all, the mucosal structure changes from the jejunum to the ileum.

#### Regional Characteristics of the Jejunum and Ileum

- In the course of the jejunum to the ileum
    - The circular folds become flatter and are spaced further apart.
    - Increased accumulations of lymph follicles (Peyer’s patches): Located individually in the jejunum, densely packed in the ileum.
        - Located in the lamina propria mucosae and tela submucosa
        - The epithelium over the lymph follicles (dome epithelium) contains M cells: apical uptake of antigens, transcytosis, and transfer to immune cells (including lymphocytes)
    - The wedges are getting shorter.
    - The crypts are getting deeper
    - The number of Paneth cells increases.

> [!NOTE]
> The jejunum is the site of the strongest absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. In the sense of the phrase "form follows function," the histological differentiation of this section of the intestine primarily aims at increasing the surface area of the mucosa!

### Function

The jejunum and ileum continue the enzymatic breakdown and mixing of food. Additionally, the absorption of food components occurs here, with some being primarily absorbed by the jejunum and others mainly by the ileum.

- Jejunum: In particular, water, amino acids, hexoses, water-soluble vitamins, fatty acids, lipids, and electrolytes
- Ileum: Especially Vitamin B12, Vitamin C, and bile acids

> [!NOTE]
> The absorption of vitamin B12 in the ileum can only occur once it has formed a complex with the intrinsic factor (produced by the parietal cells of the stomach)!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Small Intestine
### Histological Features of the Small Intestine

What are the macroscopically visible folds of the small intestine called, and what histological layers do they consist of?
- The so-called "Kerckring folds" (Plicae circulares) are macroscopically visible mucosal folds of the small intestine up to 1 cm high, produced by the Tunica mucosa and Tela submucosa. They serve to increase the surface area and do not flatten out even when the intestinal wall is stretched.

What structures that serve to increase surface area characterize the small intestine?
- Since the majority of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine, its absorptive surface must be as large as possible. An increase in surface area is achieved by tall, finger-like villi (Villi intestinales) and the deep crypts (Lieberkühn crypts) located between them.

How do the smooth muscle cells of the small intestine communicate with each other?
- The cells of the smooth muscle in the small intestine are coupled via Gap Junctions. This forms a functional unit that ensures synchronized peristalsis of the intestine.

What is the function of the goblet cells and in which layer of the intestinal wall are they located?
- Goblet cells are individual glandular cells scattered in the Tunica mucosa of the small and large intestines. They contain "goblet-shaped" vacuoles from which mucus (mucins) can be secreted.

Which cells are present in the crypts and what are their respective functions?
- The crypts of the small intestinal epithelium serve both to increase surface area and contain immune and stem cells as well as enteroendocrine cells. The so-called "Paneth cells" are located at the base of the crypts (especially in the jejunum and ileum) and are part of the nonspecific immune defense. Enteroendocrine cells secrete substances (e.g., gastrin) that, among other things, influence gastric acid secretion. Because the cells of the small intestinal epithelium live for only about five days, sufficient stem cells must be present. These are located in the crypts and migrate from there to the villi.

### Duodenum

What are the four sections of the duodenum, at approximately which vertebrae do they lie, and what are their peritoneal relations?
- The duodenum is divided from proximal to distal into the intraperitoneally located pars superior and the secondarily retroperitoneal pars descendens, pars horizontalis, and pars ascendens. The pars superior is approximately at the level of the first lumbar vertebra, and the pars horizontalis is at the level of the third lumbar vertebra. Thus, the duodenum more or less surrounds the second lumbar vertebral body.

Name the sections of the duodenum that are most likely topographically related to the following structures: A. superior mesenteric artery, A. gastroduodenalis, right kidney.
- The duodenum has close topographic relationships to numerous structures. The superior mesenteric artery runs behind the pancreas downwards and then crosses the horizontal part (pars horizontalis) of the duodenum; the gastroduodenal artery runs behind the superior part (pars superior) of the duodenum; and the right kidney is closely related to the descending part (pars descendens) of the duodenum.

In which part of the duodenum is the major duodenal papilla located, and which structures open here?
- At the major duodenal papilla (Papilla Vateri), the common bile duct (Ductus choledochus) and the pancreatic duct (Ductus pancreaticus) open together into the descending part (pars descendens) of the duodenum.

In which part of the duodenum is the ampulla of Vater (duodenal bulb) located?
- The ampulla of the duodenum (Bulbus duodeni) refers to an ampullary dilation of the superior part (pars superior) of the duodenum, the first part of the duodenum.

What is the Treitz band?
- The suspensory ligament of the duodenum (Ligamentum suspensorium duodeni, also known as the Treitz band) or the suspensory muscle of the duodenum (M. suspensorius duodeni, also called "Treitz band" or "Treitz muscle") fixes the duodenojejunal flexure (the ascending part of the duodenum) at the origin of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta. It forms the border between the upper and middle gastrointestinal tract and constricts the intestine like a sphincter.

Where are the so-called "Brunner's glands" (Glandulae duodenales) located?
- Brunner's glands are mucous, tubuloalveolar glands of the duodenum located in the submucosa (Tela submucosa). Their secretory ducts pass through the lamina muscularis mucosae and open into the crypts.

### Jejunum and Ileum

Which nutrients or body substances are primarily absorbed in the ileum?
- Nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine, with the ileum typically absorbing vitamin B12 and vitamin C. Additionally, the ileum is involved in the so-called "enterohepatic circulation": bile acids that have been secreted by the liver via the gallbladder into the intestine to aid fat digestion are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and transported back to the liver through the portal vein.
