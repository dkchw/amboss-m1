# Cranial Nerves
## Summary

The twelve special nerves are referred to as cranial nerves, which, unlike the spinal nerves, originate from the brain. They are numbered according to their exit from the brain from rostral to caudal and are considered peripheral nerves. An exception to this rule is made for the first two cranial nerves: the olfactory nerve (I) and the optic nerve (II). Strictly speaking, they are extensions of the central nervous system and are enveloped by meninges.

Every cranial nerve has different functions and fiber qualities that allow us humans to respond to our environment (Efferents) or to receive information (Afferents). In contrast to spinal nerves, cranial nerves have the unique characteristic that sensory and motor fibers enter and exit at the same location in the brainstem.

Failures of individual cranial nerves are manifested in certain cranial nerve syndromes, which can be diagnosed through a targeted neurological examination of the cranial nerves.
## Development and Growth of the Cranial Nerves

The cranial nerves develop from the 4th to 5th week of the embryonic period. Their embryological origin is illustrated in the following table.

### Overview of the Cranial Nerves

### The Twelve Cranial Nerves

The twelve pairs of cranial nerves are numbered in the order of their exit or entry. Depending on the cranial nerve, the entry or exit points are located in the mesencephalon, in the pons, or in the medulla oblongata. Their areas of supply are mainly in the head and neck region; an exception is the vagus nerve (X), which extends into the abdominal cavity. The cranial nerve nuclei (a total of 18) are both the projection sites of the sensory cranial nerves and the origins of the motor cranial nerves. According to the quality that a nerve conducts, seven categories are distinguished among the cranial nerves, according to which the cranial nerve nuclei are classified. Some cranial nerves possess different qualities and accordingly multiple nuclei. It is generally true that the somatoefferent nuclei are located medially, the somatoafferent laterally, and the viszeroefferent and viszeroafferent are located in between.

| |Nerve|Location of the core|Fiber quality|
|---|---|---|---|
|I|Olfactory nerve|Telencephalon|- Special visceral afferent|
|II|Optic nerve|Diencephalon|- Special somatoafferent|
|III|Oculomotor nerve|Mesencephalon|- General somatoefferent<br>- General viszeroefferent (parasympathetic)|
|IV|Trochlear Nerve|- General Somatic Efferent|
|V|Trigeminal nerve|Pons|- Specifically visceromotor<br>- Generally somatosensory|
|VI|Abducens nerve|- General somatic efferent|
|VII|Facial nerve|- Special visceral efferent<br>- Special visceral afferent<br>- General visceral efferent (parasympathetic)<br>- General somatic afferent|
|VIII|Vestibulocochlear nerve|Medulla oblongata|- Special somatoafferent|
|IX|Glossopharyngeal nerve|- Specifically visceromotor<br>- Specifically viscerosensory<br>- General visceromotor (parasympathetic)<br>- General viscerosensory<br>- General somatosensory|
|X|Vagus nerve|- Specifically viscerotafferent<br>- Specifically visceroefferent<br>- General viscerotafferent (parasympathetic)<br>- General visceroefferent<br>- General somatoafferent|
|XI|Accessory nerve|- Specifically viszeroefferent<br>- Generally somatoefferent|
|XII|Hypoglossal nerve|- General somatoefferent|

> For better clarity and consistency, the course of the nerves in this chapter is presented from their roots to the branches - regardless of whether it is an afferent or efferent nerve! (The only exceptions to this are the first two cranial nerves.)

### Ganglia of the Cranial Nerves

In the cranial nerves, two different types of ganglia are distinguished: sensory and autonomic. The sensory ganglia contain the perikarya of pseudounipolar nerve cells; no switching occurs in them. The autonomic ganglia are all parasympathetic: on one hand, they contain the perikarya of multipolar nerve cells, and on the other hand, switching from the 1st to the 2nd neuron occurs in them.

|Cranial Nerve|Vegetative Ganglia|Sensory Ganglia|
|---|---|---|
|Oculomotor nerve (III)|- Ciliary ganglion|- /|
|Trigeminal nerve (V)|- /|- Trigeminal ganglion|
|Facial nerve (VII)|- Pterygopalatine ganglion<br>- Submandibular ganglion|- Geniculate ganglion|
|N. vestibulocochlearis (VIII)|- /|- Spiral ganglion<br>- Vestibular ganglion|
|Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX)|- Otic ganglion|- Superior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve<br>- Inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve<br>- Tympanic ganglion|
|N. vagus (X)|- Prevertebral and intramural ganglia|- Superior ganglion of the vagus nerve<br>- Inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve|

### Olfactory Nerve (I)

The olfactory nerve is the nerve responsible for smell. It carries afferent signals from the olfactory mucosa of the nose (1st neuron) via the olfactory tract to the olfactory bulb (2nd neuron).

### Overview

| - Specifically viszeroafferent (Smell) | - No nuclei, as it has evolved directly from the Telencephalon | - Olfactory mucosa | - Lamina cribrosa |

### Progress

1. The unmyelinated axons of the primary sensory cells of the olfactory mucosa bundle together to form the olfactory nerve
2. Entry of the nerve through the lamina cribrosa in the ethmoid bone
3. Draws into the anterior cranial fossa to the olfactory bulb
4. Further course as olfactory tract to the cerebrum

> [!NOTE] Skull-Brain Trauma
> Injuries to the lamina cribrosa, such as in the context of a skull-brain injury, can lead to olfactory disturbances (parosmia, anosmia) due to damage to the olfactory nerve. The occurrence of a rhinorrhea (discharge of cerebrospinal fluid from the nose) is also typical.

## Optic nerve (II)

The optic nerve is the nerve that serves vision. It is formed by the projections of the 3rd neuron of the visual pathway (ganglion cells of the retina).

| - Special somatosensory (Vision) | - No nuclei, as it evolved directly from the Diencephalon | - Retina | - Optic canal |

### Progress

1. The axons of the ganglion cells of the retina (3. neuron of the visual pathway) converge to form the optic nerve
2. The optic nerve leaves the retina through the optic disc
3. Passage through the common tendinous ring and skull entry through the optic canal in the sphenoid bone into the middle cranial fossa
4. Pulls to the optic chiasm
    - Fibers of the nasal retina portion cross to the opposite side.
    - Temporal fibers continue to extend uncrossed.
5. Temporal portions of one side and nasal portions of the opposite side continue together to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus, where they are processed.
6. As optic radiation ends, the nerve reaches its target organ, the primary visual cortex

> [!NOTE]
> In the optic chiasm, the nasal fibers of the optic nerve (temporal(!) visual field) cross over to the opposite side. These fibers, along with the uncrossed temporal fibers (nasal(!) visual field), are referred to as the optic tract!

> [!NOTE]
> The visual pathway runs through the lateral geniculate body (like "light"), whereas the auditory pathway runs through the medial geniculate body (like "music")!

> [!NOTE] Disorders of the Visual Pathway
> The optic nerve can be damaged at various points along its course. Depending on the site of the damage, specific deficits occur. For example, a pituitary tumor can damage the crossing fibers in the optic chiasm, resulting in the temporal visual field of both eyes no longer being perceived. This is also referred to as the "tunnel vision phenomenon" or bitemporal hemianopia.

> [!NOTE] Pupil reflex
> The examination of the pupillary reflex is one of the standard neurological examinations. For this, a light is shone on the pupil, which usually constricts in response (direct light reaction). This reaction is mediated by the optic nerve and oculomotor nerve. The optic nerve transmits the light stimulus from the retina via the optic tract not as usual to the lateral geniculate body, but to the pretectal area at the border of the midbrain and diencephalon. There, the impulses are switched and then forwarded to the accessory nucleus of the oculomotor nerve (Edinger-Westphal nucleus). Its efferent fibers travel back to the pupil with the oculomotor nerve and innervate the internal eye muscles (ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae). A particular feature here is that the efferents of the pretectal area innervate the pupils of both eyes so that when one eye is illuminated, the pupil constriction also occurs in the eye on the opposite side. This process is called the indirect or consensual light reaction.

> [!NOTE]
> In the case of unilateral damage to the afferent (e.g., optic nerve), both the direct and indirect light reaction are affected when illuminating the eye on the affected side, while the pupil reaction remains normal when illuminating the eye on the healthy side. In the case of damage to the efferent (e.g., oculomotor nerve or ciliary ganglion), both the direct and indirect light reaction are affected on the affected side, while they can be elicited on the healthy side.

## Oculomotor Nerve (III)

The oculomotor nerve exclusively carries efferents and innervates a large part of the extraocular muscles, partly motor (somatoefferent), partly parasympathetic (viszeroefferent).

### Course and Branches

1. The fibers of the two nuclei unite to form the N. oculomotorius, which leaves the mesencephalon ventrally through the fossa interpeduncularis of the brainstem.
2. The nerve runs between the skull and the brain in the lateral dura of the cavernous sinus in a rostral direction.
3. Exit of the skull through the superior orbital fissure into the orbit
4. There branching into three end branches
    - R. superior n. oculomotorii (general somatic efferent): Innervates motorically the M. levator palpebrae superioris and the M. rectus superior
    - R. inferior n. oculomotorii (general somatoefferent): Innervates motorically the M. rectus medialis, M. rectus inferior and M. obliquus inferior
    - R. to the ciliary ganglion (general viszeroefferent): Parasympathetic fibers that are switched in the ciliary ganglion and reach the pupil muscles (M. ciliaris and M. sphincter pupillae)

> [!NOTE] Oculomotor Palsy
> In the case of a complete failure of the oculomotor nerve, various symptoms occur:
> 
> - Eyelid drooping (Ptosis) due to the failure of the M. levator palpebrae superioris
> - View downwards externally through the intact M. obliquus superior and M. rectus lateralis
> - Dilated pupil (mydriasis) due to the failure of the M. sphincter pupillae
> - Suspended near accommodation due to the failure of the ciliary muscle

## Trochlear Nerve (IV)

The N. trochlearis carries only motor fibers. It innervates the M. obliquus superior, which is responsible for rotating the eye inward, abducting it, and lowering the eyeball during adduction.

### Overview

| - General somatoefferent (motor innervation) | - Ncl. n. trochlearis | - M. obliquus superior | - Superior orbital fissure |

### Progress

1. The fibers of the Ncl. n. trochlearis completely cross intracerebrally to the opposite side and run dorsally within the mesencephalon.
2. The fibers exit the brainstem dorsally at the caudal edge of the quadrigeminal plate (lamina quadrigemina)
3. The nerve continues towards the tentorium cerebelli, where the fibers enter the dura.
4. Course in the lateral dural wall of the cavernous sinus
5. Exit of the skull through the superior orbital fissure into the orbit
6. There he moves towards his target muscle: M. obliquus superior

> [!NOTE]
> The N. trochlearis is the only cranial nerve that emerges dorsally from the brainstem!

> [!NOTE]
> Of all the cranial nerves, the trochlear nerve is the only one whose fibers completely cross to the opposite side!

> [!NOTE] Trochlearisparese
> A lesion of the trochlear nerve leads to paralysis of the superior oblique muscle. Due to the resulting overactivity of the other eye muscles, the affected eye is directed upwards and inwards as well as slightly rotated outwards. This results in oblique, vertical double vision, which is most pronounced when looking down nasally (e.g., while reading). To reduce the deviation of the globe (particularly due to the impaired internal rotation) and to lessen the double vision, patients often tilt their heads toward the healthy side (the so-called Bielschowsky phenomenon). Conversely, the deliberate tilting of the head toward the affected side can exacerbate the double vision and the elevated position of the globe, and can be used diagnostically.

## Trigeminal Nerve (V)

The trigeminal nerve carries both motor and sensory fibers for the innervation of the face and has three main branches: ophthalmic nerve (V1), maxillary nerve (V2), and mandibular nerve (V3).

> [!NOTE]
> The efferents of the trigeminal nerve run exclusively in the mandibular nerve!

### Shared History

1. The fibers of the four core areas emerge laterally from the Pons and bundle together to form the N. trigeminus
2. Entry into the trigeminal cave at the anterior side of the petrous bone
3. There, the aggregation of sensitive fibers to the trigeminal ganglion (Ganglion Gasseri)
4. Branching into the three main branches
    - N. ophthalmicus (V1)
    - N. maxillaris (V2)
    - N. mandibularis (V3)

### Special Features of the Trigeminal Nerve

Some nerves use the trigeminal nerve as a guiding structure:

- Facial Nerve
    - Parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve attach to the lacrimal nerve (branch of V1) and the zygomatic nerve (branch of V2) and thus reach the lacrimal gland.
    - Parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve attach to the lingual nerve (branch of V3) and reach the submandibular gland and sublingual gland via the chorda tympani.
    - Taste fibers of the facial nerve attach to the lingual nerve (branch of V3) and thus reach the anterior two-thirds of the tongue
- N. glossopharyngeus: Parasympathetic fibers of the N. glossopharyngeus associate with the N. auriculotemporalis (branch of V3) on the way to the Gl. parotidea

> [!NOTE] Kornealreflex (Blink reflex)
> For the so-called corneal reflex, the examiner brings a cotton swab close to the cornea; upon touching the cornea, a blinking occurs. The afferent pathway of this reflex runs via the trigeminal nerve (ophthalmic nerve).

#### Course and Branches

1. The N. ophthalmicus branches off from the trigeminal ganglion.
2. It runs after leaving the trigeminal ganglion in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus
3. Submission of a retrograde R. meningeus recurrens for the sensory innervation of the meninges
4. Division into three branches and exit of the skull through the superior orbital fissure into the orbit
    - N. lacrimalis: Sensory innervation of the conjunctiva, lateral upper eyelid, lacrimal gland
    - N. frontalis: Sensory innervation of the forehead and upper eyelid, mucosa of the frontal sinus
        - Gives off two smaller branches: N. supratrochlearis and N. supraorbitalis (exits through the foramen supraorbitale)
    - N. nasociliaris: Sensory innervation of the eye membranes, skin and mucous membranes of the nose, tear sac, tip of the nose, ethmoid cells, sphenoid sinus
        - Gives off various small branches: R. ad ciliary ganglion, R. communicans with the ciliary ganglion, long ciliary nerves, infratrochlear nerve, anterior ethmoidal nerve, and posterior ethmoidal nerve

#### Course and Branches

1. The N. maxillaris branches off from the trigeminal ganglion
2. It runs after leaving the trigeminal ganglion in the basolateral wall of the cavernous sinus
3. Gives an intracranial meningeal branch for the sensory innervation of the meninges.
4. Passes through the foramen rotundum into the pterygopalatine fossa and branches off there into the following branches.
    - N. zygomaticus: Sensory innervation of the skin over the zygomatic and temporal bone; parasympathetic innervation of the lacrimal gland via the so-called tear anastomosis
        - Tear anastomosis (R. communicans with the zygomatic nerve): connection between N. zygomaticus (V2) and N. lacrimalis (V1), in which parasympathetic fibers of the N. facialis run
    - N. infraorbitalis: Sensory innervation of the skin between the lower eyelid and upper lip, the maxillary sinus and the upper jaw teeth, as well as exiting from the facial skull through the infraorbital foramen.
    - Rr. ganglionares to the pterygopalatine ganglion: Sensory fibers that innervate the ethmoid cells, mucous membranes of the nose and the palate and project to the pterygopalatine ganglion

#### Progress

1. The N. mandibularis branches off from the trigeminal ganglion
2. It runs in the cranial fossa up to the skull passage through the foramen ovale
3. It continues through the infratemporal fossa and gives off the following branches there.
    - R. meningeus (general somatosensory): It supplies the anterior parts of the meninges and part of the sphenoid sinus sensibly.
    - Motor branches to the innervated muscles (see above)
        - N. massetericus (also sensory fibers): Supplies the M. masseter motorically and the temporomandibular joint sensorially.
        - Deep temporal nerves: Supply the temporal muscle motorically
        - Nn. pterygoidei: Supply the M. pterygoideus medialis and the M. pterygoideus lateralis motorically.
        - N. musculi tensoris tympani: Supplies the M. tensor tympani motor function
        - N. musculi tensoris veli palatini: Supplies the M. tensor veli palatini motor function
    - Sensory branches for the innervation of the mandibular region
        - N. auriculotemporalis: Sensory innervation of the skin at the temple and ear (more specifically the temporal bone, auricle, external auditory canal and tympanic membrane)
        - N. inferior alveolar
            - It runs in the infratemporal fossa between the medial pterygoid muscle and the lateral pterygoid muscle, enters the mandibular canal through the mandibular foramen, and exits the facial skull with its terminal branch (mental nerve) through the mental foramen.
            - Motor branch: N. mylohyoideus
            - Sensible branches (Supply teeth, chin, and lower lip): Rr. dentales, R. incisivus, and N. mentalis
        - N. buccalis: Supplies skin on the cheek and oral mucosa
    - Mixed branch for the innervation of tongue and salivary glands
        - N. lingualis
            - Sensory branches (supply the anterior ⅔ of the tongue, the soft palate, and other parts of the oral mucosa)
            - Taste fibers of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue
            - Parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular gland, sublingual gland, and anterior lingual gland

> [!NOTE]
> The maxillary nerve exits the skull through the foramen rotundum ("round max") while the mandibular nerve exits through the foramen ovale ("oval almond")!

> [!NOTE] Trigeminus pressure points
> The so-called trigeminal pressure points are located at the exit points of the three sensory terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve (supraorbital nerve, infraorbital nerve, mental nerve) from the facial skull. The exit points are named according to the nerves: supraorbital foramen, infraorbital foramen, and mental foramen. They can be particularly painful to pressure in the context of sinusitis or trigeminal neuralgia and should be checked during the physical examination.

> [!NOTE] Trigeminal Neuralgia
> In trigeminal neuralgia, there are lightning-like, excruciating facial pains (also referred to as tic douloureux) that primarily occur in the distribution areas of the second and third trigeminal branches. The pain usually disappears after a few seconds but can occur up to 100 times a day, resulting in significant suffering for the patients.

### Abducens Nerve (VI)

The abducens nerve carries only motor fibers to its target muscle, the lateral rectus muscle. This muscle abducts the eye, moving it outward.

| - General somatoefferent (motor innervation) | - Ncl. n. abducentis | - M. rectus lateralis | - Superior orbital fissure |

### Progress

1. The fibers of the N. abducens extend from the Ncl. n. abducentis in the Pons to the sulcus bulbopontinus and emerge ventrally between the Pons and the Medulla oblongata.
2. The nerve continues along the basal surface of the bridge and passes through the dura in the area of the clivus.
3. In the cavernous sinus, it runs alongside the internal carotid artery and connects to the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve.
4. Exit of the skull through the superior orbital fissure into the orbit
5. There he moves to his target muscle: M. rectus lateralis

> [!NOTE] Nerve-abducens-lesion
> A damage to the abducens nerve results in the affected eye deviating inward. When looking temporally, there may be a restriction of the visual field and double vision. Since the nerve runs over a long distance at the base of the skull, a skull base fracture is primarily considered as the cause of a abducens nerve lesion.

## Facial nerve (VII)

The VIIth cranial nerve is divided into two parts: it consists of the fibers of the facial nerve as well as the fibers that are attached to it and are summarized into the intermediate nerve. In the facial nerve, specifically visceromotor fibers run from the nucleus of the facial nerve (for the innervation of the facial muscles) and in the intermediate nerve general visceromotor (parasympathetic innervation of various glands) as well as specifically viscerosensory fibers (for taste perception). Both nerves can also be summarized into the intermediofacial nerve (facial nerve + intermediate nerve).

### Course and Branches

#### Intracerebral

1. The fibers of the facial nerve run from the nucleus of the facial nerve initially dorsally around the nucleus of the abducens nerve and form the internal facial knee.
    - The internal facial knee forms a paramedian bulge on both sides at the bottom of the rhomboid fossa (facial colliculus)
2. Convergence with N. intermedius from Ncl. salivatorius superior and Ncl. tractus solitarii (the N. intermediofacialis is formed)
3. Common exit from the brainstem in the cerebellopontine angle between the pons and the olive

#### I'm Felsenbein

1. Course through the internal acoustic meatus into the internal acoustic canal.
2. Further course in the Canalis n. facialis of the temporal bone, where it changes its course direction and thus forms the external facial knee.
3. Convergence of the fibers to the geniculate ganglion
    - In the ganglion of the geniculate are located the perikarya of the chorda tympani and of the posterior auricular nerve
    - All other fibers pass through the geniculate ganglion without synapsing.
4. Still in the petrous part of the following branches (running in or near the walls of the tympanic cavity)
    - N. petrosus major (Passage through the Foramen lacerum and synapse in the Ganglion pterygopalatinum ): Parasympathetic innervation of the Glandulae nasales, Glandulae palatinae and Glandula lacrimalis
    - N. stapedius: Motor innervation of the M. stapedius
    - Chorda tympani: Various fiber qualities
        - Specifically viszeroafferent taste fibers: Supply of the anterior ⅔ of the tongue
        - General viszeroefferent (parasympathetic) fibers: Relay in the submandibular ganglion and innervation of the submandibular gland, sublingual gland and lingual gland anterior

#### Extracranial

1. The main trunk of the N. facialis continues on and exits the skull through the foramen stylomastoideum.
2. Branching into several motor branches, the majority of which form the intraparotid plexus in the parotid gland.
    - Branches to facial muscles
        - N. auricularis posterior (mixed nerve!): Innervation of the posterior ear muscles and the posterior belly of the M. occipitofrontalis, sensory supply of the auricle
        - Intraparotid plexus
            - Temporal nerves: Innervation of the facial muscles of the temple, forehead (including the anterior belly of the occipitofrontalis muscle) and eyelids
            - Rr. zygomatici: Innervation of the facial muscles at the lower eyelid and above the cheekbone
            - Buccal branches: Innervation of the facial muscles of the cheek, mouth- and nostril opening
            - R. marginalis mandibulae: Innervation of the facial muscles at the chin
            - R. colli: Innervation of the Platysmas
                - Forms an anastomosis with the N. transversus colli from C3
    - Branches to the floor of the mouth muscles
        - R. digastricus: Innervation of the posterior belly of the M. digastricus
        - R. stylohyoideus: Innervation of the M. stylohyoideus

> [!NOTE] Corneal reflex (Blink reflex)
> The touch of the cornea of the eye reflexively leads to the closing of the eyelids. The stimulus of the touch is transmitted via the N. ophthalmicus (branch of the N. trigeminus), immediately followed by a contraction of the M. orbicularis oculi. This is innervated efferently by the N. facialis. It protects the eyeball from foreign bodies and drying out, and should also be tested as part of every neurological examination to assess the functions of parts of the N. trigeminus as well as the N. facialis.

> [!NOTE] Facial paralysis  
> Im Ncl. n. facialis werden die speziell viszeroefferenten Fasern aus dem Gyrus praecentralis (motorischer Kortex) auf das 2. Motoneuron umgeschaltet, die dann im N. facialis zur mimischen Muskulatur führen. The Ncl. n. facialis can be divided into two parts: an upper part that receives fibers from both the contralateral and ipsilateral Gyrus praecentralis, and a lower part that only receives fibers from the contralateral Gyrus praecentralis. From the upper part arise the fibers that supply the forehead and eye muscles, while from the lower part arise the fibers for the lower half of the face. If the area between the Gyrus praecentralis and Ncl. n. facialis is damaged on one side, it leads to contralateral paralysis of the muscles of the lower half of the face. Only frowning and closing the eyes are still possible since these functions are controlled by both hemispheres of the brain. In this case, it is referred to as a central or supranuclear facial palsy. Conversely, if there is damage to the area between the Ncl. n. facialis and the periphery, paralysis of the entire ipsilateral muscle occurs (drooping corner of the mouth, inability to close the eyes, frowning not possible). This type of damage is referred to as peripheral facial palsy. Depending on the level of the lesion, additional symptoms may occur in peripheral facial palsy: taste disturbance of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (lesion before the departure of the chorda tympani), reduced saliva production (lesion before the departure of the chorda tympani), hyperacusis due to loss of the M. stapedius (lesion before the departure of the N. stapedius), reduced tear secretion (lesion before the departure of the N. petrosus major). Which symptoms are present therefore depends on where along the path the nerve is damaged. A rare special form of peripheral facial palsy is the nuclear facial palsy, which occurs due to an isolated lesion of the motor nuclei in the brainstem, leading to peripheral palsy.

> [!NOTE] Fractures of the Fibula
> The facial nerve branches off in the temporal bone into its various branches. In the context of a traumatic brain injury, it can lead to a fracture of the temporal bone and consequently result in damage to the facial nerve. This is then manifested as a peripheral facial paralysis.

### Vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII)

The vestibulocochlear nerve innervates the auditory and vestibular organs and consists of two parts, the vestibular nerve and the cochlear nerve.

### Course and Branches

1. The afferent fibers of the vestibulocochlear nerve run from the directly adjacent vestibular and cochlear nuclei to the cerebellopontine angle and exit there together from the brainstem.
2. Skull exit through the internal acoustic meatus
3. Course within a common connective tissue sheath through the internal auditory canal
4. Division into two main branches
    1. N. vestibularis: Transmits balance information from the three semicircular canals and the two macula organs
    2. N. cochlearis: Transmits acoustic information from the hair cells of the Corti organ

> [!NOTE]
> Some fibers of the N. vestibularis travel directly to the cerebellum without synapsing (i.e., bypassing the vestibular nuclei)!

> [!NOTE] Acoustic Neuroma  
> The acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor of the Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve, which grows displacing into the surrounding area, potentially leading to compression of the nerve with a slowly progressing hearing loss and gait instability. In further progression, it can also lead to compression of the trigeminal nerves (paresthesias in the affected area) and facial nerves (facial paralysis) (see also: cerebellopontine angle syndrome). Additionally, large tumors can increase intracranial pressure.

## Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX)

The glossopharyngeal nerve innervates various structures in the oral and pharyngeal region both motorically and sensitively.

1. The fibers of the five core areas merge and exit laterally behind the olive from the medulla oblongata.
2. Further course towards Felsenbein
3. Thickening of the intracranially located superior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve (general somatosensory) and skull passage through the jugular foramen
4. Just below the jugular foramen thickening to the extracranially located inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve (general somatosensory as well as specifically and generally viscerosensory)
5. It runs between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein as well as behind the stylopharyngeus muscle to the tongue and gives off the following branches.
    - N. tympanicus: Enters through the Canaliculus tympanicus into the tympanic cavity and forms the tympanic plexus, which contains the tympanic ganglion and provides sensory innervation to the mucous membrane of the middle ear.
        - R. tubarius: Sensible innervation of tympanic cavity and auditory tube
        - N. petrosus minor: Is switched in the otic ganglion and innervates parasympathetically the parotid gland and the buccal glands and labial glands.
    - R. sinus carotici: Captures the visceral afferents from the wall of the carotid sinus and from the carotid body
    - R. musculi stylopharyngei: Motor innervation of the M. stylopharyngeus
    - Rr. pharyngei n. glossopharyngei: Form the plexus pharyngeus with the eponymous branches of the N. vagus (the plexus pharyngeus (nerve plexus) innervates parasympathetically the pharyngeal glands, provides sensory innervation to the pharyngeal mucosa, and motor innervation to the M. constrictor pharyngis, M. salpingopharyngeus, M. palatopharyngeus, M. palatoglossus, M. levator veli palatini, and M. uvulae)
    - Rr. tonsillares n. glossopharyngei: Sensory innervation of the palatine tonsil
    - Rr. linguales n. glossopharyngei: Sensory innervation and taste perception from the posterior third of the tongue

> [!NOTE] Jugular-Foramen Syndrome
> The glossopharyngeal nerve exits together with the vagus nerve and accessory nerve through the jugular foramen – in the context of skull base fractures, this can lead to the so-called jugular foramen syndrome. This syndrome manifests itself, among other things, through swallowing disorders, dys-/paresthesias in the innervation areas of the involved nerves, tachycardia, constipation, as well as through difficulty in head and shoulder movements.

## Vagus nerve (X)

The vagus nerve is the largest nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system and has the largest area of innervation of all cranial nerves. Unlike the other cranial nerves, its afferent and efferent fibers do not limit themselves to the head and neck area but extend into the abdominal cavity.

### Course and Branches

1. The paired fibers from the five nuclei emerge together ventrally from the medulla oblongata behind the olive.
2. Thickening of the intracranially located superior ganglion of the vagus nerve and common skull passage with the accessory nerve through the jugular foramen
    - Delivery of sensitive branches at the level of the ganglion superius
        - R. meningeus (general somatosensory): Sensory innervation of the dura
        - R. auricularis (general somatosensory): Sensory innervation of the external auditory canal
3. Just below the jugular foramen thickening to the extracranial inferior ganglion of the vagus nerve and the release of mixed branches.
    - Superior laryngeal nerve (specifically visceromotor, generally viscerosensory)
        - R. externus: Motor innervation of the M. cricothyroideus
        - R. internus: Sensory innervation of the laryngeal mucosa above the glottis (the nerve runs directly beneath the mucosal wall of the piriform recess of the pharynx)
    - R. pharyngeus n. vagi (general and special viscerosensory, special visceromotor, general somatomotor)
4. Further course in the carotid sheath between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery and branching of mixed branches.
    - Bronchial branches of the vagus nerve (general visceroefferent, general visceroafferent): Project to the pulmonary plexus
    - Cardiac branches of the thoracic vagus nerve (general viszeroefferent, general viszeroafferent): Lead to the cardiac plexus
    - N. laryngeus recurrens (specifically visceromotor, generally viscerosensory): Wraps around the aortic arch (N. laryngeus recurrens left) or the subclavian artery (N. laryngeus recurrens right) and runs back to the larynx; here there is a close topographical relationship to the thyroid gland
        - Motor innervation of the laryngeal muscles (except for the M. cricothyroideus)
        - Sensory innervation of the laryngeal mucosa below the glottis
    - Superior and inferior cervical cardiac nerves (general viszeroefferent, general viszeroafferent): Pull towards the cardiac plexus
5. The left and right vagus nerve extend to the esophagus and form the esophageal plexus (generally visceromotor, generally viscerosensory)
6. Subsequently, they bundle into the anterior vagal trunk (left vagus nerve) and posterior vagal trunk (right vagus nerve)
7. The truncal vagal branches in the form of smaller branches and larger nerve plexuses extend to the upper abdominal organs and innervate them.

> [!NOTE] Laryngeal paralysis (Recurrent nerve palsy)
> The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the only opener of the glottis (posterior cricoarytenoid muscle). Due to its course immediately behind the thyroid gland, it can be damaged, for example, during thyroid surgeries. In the case of unilateral damage, hoarseness occurs, while bilateral damage leads to dyspnea.

> In the area of the carotid sinus of the internal carotid artery and the aortic arch, baroreceptors are located in the vessel wall, which can be activated by the stretching of the vessel wall (e.g., due to high blood pressure or external pressure). The baroreceptors transmit information via the branch of the carotid sinus and the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve as well as through fibers of the vagus nerve to the Ncl. tractus solitarii of the brainstem. The efferent parasympathetic fibers originate from the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve – as well as to a lesser extent from the ambiguous nucleus – and travel via the vagus nerve to the heart, where a reflexive lowering of blood pressure and a slowing of the heart rate occurs.

> [!NOTE] Lung inflation reflex (Hering-Breuer reflex)
> The vagus nerve transmits stretch and pain stimuli from the lung to the brainstem via its afferent fibers. If inhalation (inspiration) results in a volume increase of the lung of more than 1.5 L, the stretch receptors located in the bronchial tree are activated, and inspiration in the respiratory center is reflexively inhibited. This reflex protects the lung from overexpansion.

> [!NOTE] Nerve-vagus-lesion
> In the case of unilateral damage to the vagus nerve, various symptoms occur depending on the level of damage, which can vary in severity:
> 
> - Swallowing disorder (due to the failure of the pharyngeal muscles)
> - Paralysis of the soft palate and deviation of the uvula to the healthy side (due to the loss of pharyngeal muscle; so-called curtain phenomenon)
> - Hoarseness (due to the failure of the laryngeal muscles)
> 
> Additionally, a failure of the right vagus nerve can lead to tachycardia due to the loss of parasympathetic innervation of the sinus node; however, a failure of the left vagus nerve can result in arrhythmias due to the loss of parasympathetic innervation of the AV node.

## Accessory nerve (XI)

The accessory nerve (N. accessorius) is a purely motor cranial nerve and consists of two parts: the cranial root from the Ncl. ambiguus and the spinal root from the Ncl. spinalis n. accessorii.

### Course and Branches

1. The fibers of the Ncl. ambiguus form the cranial root of the accessory nerve and emerge caudal to the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve from the medulla oblongata.
2. The fibers of the Ncl. spinalis n. accessorii emerge extr cranially at approximately the level of the cervical segments C2–C5 and enter the cranial cavity through the Foramen magnum as the Radix spinalis n. accessorii.
3. In the cranial cavity, the two roots combine to form the truncus nervi accessorii.
4. Common skull exit of the trunk through the jugular foramen
5. Branching into two limbs
    - R. internus n. accessorii (cranial fibers): It associates with the N. laryngeus recurrens of the N. vagus and supplies all laryngeal muscles except for the M. cricothyroideus
    - R. externus n. accessorii (spinal fibers): Motor innervation of the trapezius muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle

 

> [!NOTE] Nerve-Accessory-Lesion 
> In the case of a unilateral lesion of the accessory nerve – for example, after procedures on the neck during a lymph node biopsy – there may be functional impairments of the affected muscles. In the case of paralysis of the trapezius muscle, there is a drooping shoulder on the affected side as a result. Additionally, patients have difficulty raising the arm above 90°. If the sternocleidomastoid muscle is affected, a flaccid paralysis on the affected side leads to a so-called torticollis and difficulty turning the head contralaterally.

## Hypoglossal Nerve (XII)

The hypoglossal nerve is a purely motor nerve that innervates the tongue muscles.

### Course and Branches

1. The fibers continue caudally from the Ncl. n. hypoglossi through the medulla oblongata
2. You leave the brainstem between the lower olive and the pyramid
3. Efferent fibers from C1–2 attach to the nerve.
4. The exit from the skull occurs through the hypoglossal canal.
5. Between the M. mylohyoideus and the M. hyoglossus, it branches into its branches.
    - Lingual branches of the hypoglossal nerve: Motor innervation of the intrinsic and extrinsic tongue muscles
    - Segregated fibers from the spinal nerves C1–2: Motor innervation of the M. geniohyoideus and M. thyrohyoideus

> [!NOTE] Nerve-hypoglossus-lesion  
> The central afferents of the hypoglossal nuclei originate from the contralateral precentral gyrus. Consequently, the right nucleus of the hypoglossal nerve is connected to the left precentral gyrus. If there is a central, supranuclear lesion on the right side, the tongue deviates contralaterally to the left. This is different in the case of a peripheral lesion, which means a lesion within or distal to the nuclei. The fibers will have already crossed, and the tongue deviates towards the side of the lesion (due to the predominance of muscle tone on the healthy side).

## Review Questions on the Chapter on Cranial Nerves
### Overview of Cranial Nerves

The nuclei of which cranial nerves are located in the pons?
- In the pons lie the nuclei of the facial nerve (N. facialis), abducens nerve (N. abducens), and trigeminal nerve (N. trigeminus).
What rule does the principal arrangement of the cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem follow?
- The arrangement of the cranial nerve nuclei in the brainstem follows their different qualities from medial to lateral: somatoefferent, viszeroefferent, viszeroafferent, and somatoafferent.
### Optic Nerve

Through which opening does the optic nerve enter the skull?
- The optic nerve (N. opticus) enters the skull through the optic canal (Canalis opticus).
Which part of the visual pathway is damaged when the affected person has a so-called tunnel vision phenomenon (heteronymous bitemporal hemianopsia)?
- If the affected person shows deficits on both sides in the temporal visual field (so-called blinders phenomenon), there is damage to the medial part of the optic chiasm and thus to the nasal parts of both optic nerves.
Which two nerves are involved in the pupillary reflex?
- The afferent limb of the pupillary reflex is formed by the optic nerve (N. opticus), the efferent limb by the oculomotor nerve (N. oculomotorius).
What is meant by a consensual light reaction?
- A consensual or indirect light reaction means that when one eye is illuminated, the pupil of the other eye also constricts. This reaction can be explained by the fact that the efferents of the pretectal area innervate the pupillary muscles of both eyes.
### Oculomotor Nerve

List the typical symptoms of an oculomotor nerve palsy!
- In a failure of the oculomotor nerve (N. oculomotorius), there typically occurs a drooping eyelid (ptosis), widely dilated pupils (mydriasis), disturbed near accommodation, and a gaze directed downwards and outwards.
Where does the oculomotor nerve emerge from the brainstem?
- The oculomotor nerve (N. oculomotorius) emerges from the brainstem at the interpeduncular fossa (Fossa interpeduncularis).
In which ganglion are the parasympathetic fibers of the N. oculomotorius switched, and what function do they have?
- The parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve (N. oculomotorius) are switched in the ciliary ganglion (Ganglion ciliare) and continue to the pupillary muscles (M. ciliaris and M. sphincter pupillae). There they cause constriction of the pupil (miosis) and near accommodation.
### N. trochlearis

At what level in the brainstem is the nucleus of the trochlear nerve located approximately, and what is special about the exit of its fibers?
- The nucleus of the trochlear nerve (Ncl. n. trochlearis) is located in the midbrain (Mesencephalon) approximately at the level of the inferior colliculi on the dorsal side of the midbrain. The trochlear nerve (N. trochlearis) is the only cranial nerve that exits the brainstem dorsally.
Which structure is innervated by the trochlear nerve?
- The trochlear nerve (N. trochlearis) innervates the superior oblique muscle (M. obliquus superior).
### Trigeminal Nerve

Name the three main branches of the N. trigeminus! In which main branch do its efferents run?
- The three main branches of the trigeminal nerve (N. trigeminus) are the ophthalmic nerve (N. ophthalmicus), maxillary nerve (N. maxillaris), and mandibular nerve (N. mandibularis). The efferents of the trigeminal nerve run exclusively in the mandibular nerve (N. mandibularis).
Which nucleus is the source of the motor fibers of the trigeminal nerve and to which muscles do they attach?
- The motor fibers of the trigeminal nerve arise from the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (Ncl. motorius n. trigemini). They run as the mandibular nerve (N. mandibularis) to the mylohyoid muscle (M. mylohyoideus), anterior belly of the digastric muscle (M. digastricus venter anterior), tensor tympani muscle (M. tensor tympani), tensor veli palatini muscle (M. tensor veli palatini) and to the masticatory muscles (M. temporalis, M. masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles).
In which nuclei do the fibers of the trigeminal nerve, which are responsible for temperature and pain sensation of the face project, and which main branches are responsible for which area?
- The fibers of the trigeminal nerve responsible for temperature and pain sensation of the face project to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (Ncl. spinalis n. trigemini). The fibers run in all three main branches: ophthalmic nerve (N. ophthalmicus) supplying the skin above the eyelid fold, maxillary nerve (N. maxillaris) supplying the skin between the eyelid and upper lip, and mandibular nerve (N. mandibularis) supplying the skin between the upper lip and chin.
In which nuclei do the fibers of the trigeminal nerve, which are responsible for the proprioceptive information from chewing muscles, temporomandibular joint, palate, and teeth project, and in which main branch of the trigeminal nerve do they travel?
- The fibers of the trigeminal nerve responsible for proprioceptive information from the chewing muscles, temporomandibular joint, palate, and teeth travel in the mandibular nerve (N. mandibularis) and terminate in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (Ncl. mesencephalicus n. trigemini).
What are the so-called trigeminal pressure points and what are they called?
- The trigeminal pressure points are located at the exit points of the three sensory terminal branches of the trigeminal nerve (N. supraorbitalis, N. infraorbitalis, and N. mentalis) and can be pressure painful in various diseases. They are named according to the nerves: supraorbital foramen (Foramen supraorbitale), infraorbital foramen (Foramen infraorbitale), and mental foramen (Foramen mentale).
What is the innervation area of the N. alveolaris inferior?
- The inferior alveolar nerve (N. alveolaris inferior) has both motor and sensory branches. The motor branch innervates the mylohyoid muscle (M. mylohyoideus) and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle (Venter anterior des M. digastricus), while the sensory branch supplies the teeth, chin, and lower lip.
### N. abducens

Through which dural sinus does the abducens nerve travel, and which vessel accompanies it closely?
- The abducens nerve (N. abducens) runs in the cavernous sinus (Sinus cavernosus) in close proximity to the internal carotid artery (A. carotis interna).
Which structure is innervated by the abducens nerve?
- The abducens nerve (N. abducens) innervates the lateral rectus muscle (M. rectus lateralis), which is responsible for abduction of the eye.
At what point does the abducens nerve exit the brainstem?
- The abducens nerve (N. abducens) exits the brainstem between the pons and the medulla oblongata.
### Facial Nerve

What three qualities does the N. facialis have and what is the corresponding brainstem nucleus for each?
- The facial nerve (N. facialis) contains fibers from the facial nucleus (Ncl. n. facialis) for motor innervation (specifically viszeroefferent), fibers from the nucleus of the solitary tract (Ncl. tractus solitarii) for taste perception (specifically viszeroafferent), and fibers from the superior salivatory nucleus (Ncl. salivatorius superior) for parasympathetic innervation (general viszeroefferent).
Through which opening does the facial nerve exit the skull?
- The facial nerve (N. facialis) exits the skull through the stylomastoid foramen (Foramen stylomastoideum).
At what point does the facial nerve emerge from the brainstem?
- The facial nerve (N. facialis) emerges from the brainstem at the cerebellopontine angle.
The function of the chorda tympani is?
- The chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (N. facialis) with various fiber qualities. The general viszeroefferent (parasympathetic) fibers innervate the submandibular gland (Glandula submandibularis), sublingual gland (Glandula sublingualis), and anterior lingual gland (Glandula lingualis anterior). The specially viszeroafferent (taste) fibers supply the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
Where are the cell bodies of the specifically viszeroafferent taste fibers of the chorda tympani located?
- The cell bodies (Perikarya) of the taste fibers of the chorda tympani are located in the geniculate ganglion (Ganglion geniculi).
What is the function of the N. petrosus major and where does its switch occur?
- The greater petrosal nerve (N. petrosus major) is a parasympathetic branch of the facial nerve (N. facialis) that innervates the nasal glands (Glandulae nasales), palatine glands (Glandulae palatinae), and lacrimal gland (Glandula lacrimalis). The synapse from the first to the second neuron occurs in the pterygopalatine ganglion (Ganglion pterygopalatinum).
Which muscles are innervated motorically by the facial nerve?
- The facial nerve (N. facialis) innervates the muscles of facial expression, the floor of mouth muscles (M. stylohyoideus, posterior belly of M. digastricus), and the stapedius muscle (M. stapedius).
Why is it still possible to frown and close the eyes on the paralyzed side in a central (or supranuclear) facial paralysis?
- The fibers innervating the muscles of facial expression originate from the facial nucleus (Ncl. n. facialis), which is divided into an upper and a lower part. The upper part contains fibers from both the contralateral and ipsilateral cortex; the lower part only from the contralateral cortex. The fibers supplying the forehead and eye muscles come from the upper part, while those for the lower face come from the lower part. If the lesion is between the cortex and the facial nucleus, there is a contralateral paralysis of the lower face; but because the upper part still receives fibers from the ipsilateral hemisphere, frowning and eye closure remain possible.
What function does the facial nerve have in the corneal reflex, and which other cranial nerve is also involved?
- The afferent limb of the corneal reflex is formed by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (N. ophthalmicus, a branch of N. trigeminus). Mechanical irritation of the cornea activates the efferent limb, which is formed by the facial nerve (N. facialis) and immediately triggers contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle (M. orbicularis oculi).
### N. glossopharyngeus

What five qualities does the N. glossopharyngeus have and which brain nerve nucleus is associated with each?
- The glossopharyngeal nerve (N. glossopharyngeus) contains fibers from the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (Ncl. spinalis n. trigemini) for sensory innervation (general somatoafferent), fibers from the nucleus of the solitary tract (Ncl. tractus solitarii) for taste perception (special viszeroafferent) as well as for blood pressure regulation (general viszeroafferent), fibers from the inferior salivatory nucleus (Ncl. salivatorius inferior) for parasympathetic innervation (general viszeroefferent), and fibers from the ambiguous nucleus (Ncl. ambiguus) for motor innervation (special viszeroefferent).
Which structures does the N. glossopharyngeus supply sensory innervation to?
- The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies sensory innervation to the mucosa of the auditory tube and middle ear, palatine tonsil, pharyngeal mucosa, posterior third of the tongue, and soft palate.
Which structures are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve parasympathetically and in which ganglion does the synapse occur?
- The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies the parotid gland (Glandula parotidea), labial glands (Glandulae labiales), and buccal glands (Glandulae buccales) parasympathetically. The synapse takes place in the otic ganglion (Ganglion oticum).
Which muscles are innervated motorically by the N. glossopharyngeus?
- The glossopharyngeal nerve innervates the pharyngeal muscles (superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictors, stylopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus, palatopharyngeus) and some muscles of the soft palate (palatoglossus, levator veli palatini, uvula muscle).
What is the pharyngeal plexus and what is its function?
- The pharyngeal plexus is a nerve network composed of branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve (N. glossopharyngeus) and the vagus nerve (N. vagus). The plexus parasympathetically innervates the pharyngeal glands, provides sensory innervation of the pharyngeal mucosa, and motor innervation to the pharyngeal muscles (except stylopharyngeus) and parts of the palatal musculature.
What fiber qualities can be found in the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve?
- In the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Ganglion inferius n. glossopharyngei) are the cell bodies (Perikarya) of general somatoafferent and special and general viszeroafferent fibers.
### N. vagus

What five qualities does the N. vagus have and which brain nerve nucleus is associated with each?
- The vagus nerve (N. vagus) contains fibers from the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (Ncl. spinalis n. trigemini) for sensory innervation (general somatoafferent), fibers from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (Ncl. dorsalis n. vagi) for parasympathetic innervation (general viszeroefferent), fibers from the nucleus of the solitary tract (Ncl. tractus solitarii) for taste perception (special viszeroafferent) as well as blood pressure regulation (general viszeroafferent), and fibers from the ambiguous nucleus (Ncl. ambiguus) for motor innervation (special viszeroefferent).
Which organs are supplied by the N. vagus generally viszeroefferent (parasympathetic)?
- The vagus nerve supplies the lungs, heart, upper abdominal organs as well as the intestine and vessels up to the Cannon-Böhm point parasympathetically.
What function does the superior laryngeal nerve have?
- The superior laryngeal nerve (N. laryngeus superior) divides into an internal and an external branch. The external branch innervates the cricothyroid muscle (M. cricothyroideus) motorically, the internal branch innervates the laryngeal mucosa above the glottis sensibly.
What is the so-called Hering-Breuer reflex and what function does the vagus nerve perform in this context?
- The Hering-Breuer reflex protects the lung from overdistension. If the lung volume increases by more than 1.5 liters, the vagus nerve sends this information to the brainstem, causing a reflex inhibition of inspiration.
How does the recurrent laryngeal nerve run? In surgeries on which organ must particular attention be paid to it?
- The recurrent laryngeal nerve (N. laryngeus recurrens) loops around the aortic arch (left branch) or subclavian artery (right branch) and returns to the larynx. On its course, it has a close topographic relationship to the thyroid gland, so it can be injured during thyroid surgery.
How does the carotid sinus reflex work and which cranial nerves are involved?
- In the region of the carotid sinus of the internal carotid artery and the aortic arch are baroreceptors in the vessel wall that can be activated by stretch. The receptors then conduct via the carotid sinus branch (R. sinus carotici) and the inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve (Ganglion inferius n. glossopharyngei) as well as fibers of the vagus nerve to the nucleus of the solitary tract (Ncl. tractus solitarii) of the brainstem. The efferent parasympathetic fibers arise from the dorsal nucleus of the vagus (Ncl. dorsalis n. vagi) and the ambiguous nucleus (Ncl. ambiguus) and run via the vagus nerve to the heart, where a reflexive decrease of blood pressure and slowing of the heartbeat occurs.
What symptoms typically occur in a unilateral vagus nerve lesion and what are they each attributed to?
- Typical symptoms of a unilateral vagus nerve lesion are swallowing disorder and paralysis of the soft palate with deviation of the uvula to the healthy side due to loss of pharyngeal muscle function, as well as hoarseness due to paralysis of the laryngeal muscles.
Why can manipulation of the external auditory canal lead to coughing and vomiting?
- The external auditory canal is sensibly supplied by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (R. auricularis n. vagi). Since the vagus nerve also contains general viszeroefferent fibers (including for parasympathetic innervation of the upper abdominal organs), irritation of these nerve branches can cause vegetative symptoms such as vomiting and coughing.
### N. accessorius

Which muscles are innervated by the accessory nerve?
- The accessory nerve (N. accessorius) innervates the trapezius muscle (M. trapezius), the sternocleidomastoid muscle (M. sternocleidomastoideus), and, as part of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (N. laryngeus recurrens), all laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid muscle (M. cricothyroideus), which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve (N. laryngeus superior) of the vagus nerve.
### N. hypoglossus

Which muscles are innervated by the hypoglossal nerve?
- The hypoglossal nerve (N. hypoglossus) innervates the external tongue muscles (M. styloglossus, M. hyoglossus, M. genioglossus), the internal tongue muscles (M. longitudinalis superior linguae, M. longitudinalis inferior linguae, M. transversus linguae, M. verticalis linguae), and through adjoining fibers from C1–C2 the geniohyoid muscle (M. geniohyoideus) as well as the thyrohyoid muscle (M. thyrohyoideus).
What clinical picture typically occurs with a paralysis of the N. hypoglossus and what difference does it make whether the damage is central or peripheral?
- The fibers of the hypoglossal nerve cross on their way from the precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe to the hypoglossal nucleus (Ncl. n. hypoglossi) in the brainstem to the opposite side. In a central lesion, the tongue deviates towards the contralateral side clinically because the muscle tone of the healthy side predominates. In a peripheral lesion of the hypoglossal nerve—that is, damage after the fibers have crossed—the tongue deviates upon protrusion to the side of the lesion.
