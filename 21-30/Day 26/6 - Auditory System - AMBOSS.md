# Auditory System
## Summary

In the inner ear lies the cochlea, a fluid-filled system of tubes, which also houses the organ for hearing perception (the so-called Organ of Corti). In the Organ of Corti is the sensory epithelium with the so-called hair cells. Here, the conversion of the acoustic stimulus into an electrical signal occurs: The vibration of the oval window (caused by the stapes footplate) sets the fluid behind it in motion; a so-called traveling wave is formed. This wave shears the sensory hairs on the hair cells, which leads to their electrical excitation through several intermediate steps. At their base, the hair cells are again synaptically connected to fibers of the cochlear nerve; this nerve now takes over the excitation and transmits it through the stations of the auditory pathway to the central nervous system.

Hearing loss can occur due to disturbances in the external auditory canal, middle, or inner ear, as well as centrally in the area of the auditory pathway. Depending on the origin of the disturbance, hearing loss is classified as sensorineural hearing loss (disturbance in the inner ear or in the area of the auditory nerve) or conductive hearing loss (disturbance in the middle ear or in the external auditory canal). These hearing disorders can be examined through various testing methods (audiometry). Here, subjective (which depend on the active cooperation of the patient) are distinguished from objective testing methods. The simplest subjective methods are the tuning fork tests according to Rinne and Weber. An objective method is, for example, the measurement of otoacoustic emissions, which is used as a screening test for hearing damage in newborns.

### Peripheral Hearing Perception

The perception of sound in the inner ear is a multi-stage process. First, the vibrations of the stapes cause a displacement of the basilar membrane of the inner ear. Subsequently, in the area of the greatest wave motion, the outer hair cells are stimulated, causing them to undergo an active length change. The result is a local amplification of the traveling wave and an indirect excitation of the inner hair cells.

### Sound transmission to the inner ear

The sound waves reach the eardrum via air conduction through the external auditory canal. The vibrations of the eardrum are then transferred to the ossicles. Through the vibrations of the stapes footplate in the oval window, the membranes of the inner ear are displaced.

- Path of sound transmission: Sound → Air conduction through the external auditory canal → Vibration of the tympanic membrane → Transmission of vibrations to the ossicular chain (Malleus → Incus → Stapes) → Vibrations of the stapes footplate in the oval window
- Impedance matching
    - Explanation
        - Depending on the medium, different types of sound can be distinguished: e.g. airborne sound, water sound, and solid sound.
        - Each transmission medium presents a different resistance to the sound wave, which is referred to as impedance.
        - When sound waves move from one medium to another that has a different impedance, a large portion of the sound energy would be reflected or absorbed at the interface between these two media.
    - In the middle ear, two mechanisms reduce this "loss of sound waves."
        1. Pressure increase by reducing the transmission area from the tympanic membrane to the stirrup plate
        2. Leverage of the ossicles

### Formation of the Traveling Wave

The vibrations of the stirrup plate at the oval window lead to a wave-like motion within the cochlear canal system.

- Path of sound transmission
    - Stirrup plate → oval window → Scala vestibuli → Helicotrema → Scala tympani → round window
    - The cochlear duct lies between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, causing the basilar membrane to be deflected as well.

### Amplification of the traveling wave by the outer hair cells

The deflection of the basilar membrane causes a shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the sensory epithelium. This initially deflects only the stereocilia of the outer hair cells. The result is a periodic change in the length of the cell body, which generates additional vibrational energy.

- Process
    1. Vibrations of the basilar and tectorial membranes
    2. Shear movement between both membranes
    3. Protection of the stereocilia of the outer hair cells (OHC)
        - Upward movement of the basilar membrane → Stretching of the “tip-links” → Opening of transduction channels in the stereocilia
        - Downward movement of the basilar membrane → Relaxation of the “tip-links” → Closure of transduction channels in the stereocilia
    4. Influx of endolymphatic K+ into the outer hair cell (driving force: Electrical potential difference between endolymph and hair cell of about 155 mV)
    5. Depolarization
    6. (Oscillating) Length change of the AHT due to contraction
        - The protein Prestin is involved in this process.
            - Depolarisation → Shortening
            - Repolarization → Extension
    7. Additional oscillation energy

> [!NOTE]
> A failure of the outer hair cells can lead to a reduced hearing ability of up to 50 dB!

### Indirect stimulation of the inner hair cells

Through the increased vibrational energy, the inner hair cells are now also excited. These transmit the excitation to the afferent fibers of the cochlear nerve.

1. Amplified vibrational energy → Hydrodynamic coupling
2. Protection of the stereocilia of the inner hair cells
3. Stretching of the “tip links” of the inner hair cell
4. Opening of transduction channels
5. Depolarization of the inner hair cells caused by the influx of K+-ions from the endolymph (driving force: electrical potential difference between the endolymph and hair cell of approximately 155 mV)
6. K+-induced depolarization causes the opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
7. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration leads to increased neurotransmitter release (Glutamate)
8. Glutamate binds to receptors on afferent nerve fibers and triggers an EPSP.
9. Repolarization of the cell occurs through the efflux of K+ ions via basolateral potassium channels of the hair cells.

> [!NOTE]
> The outer hair cells contribute to an amplification of the traveling wave – the inner hair cells are responsible for the actual stimulus perception!

> [!NOTE]
> The opening of the transduction channels leads to an influx of K+ into the hair cell, resulting in a depolarization!

> [!NOTE] Electrocochleography
> The electrocochleography allows for a differentiated inner ear diagnostics and is used, among other things, for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease, before the use of cochlear implants, and for the objective testing of hearing ability, for example in infants. There are various invasive and non-invasive recording procedures. In invasive, transtympanic electrocochleography, a needle electrode is inserted through the eardrum and the electrical activity near the round window is measured. The following potentials can be determined:
> 
> - Microphone potential: Response of the outer hair cells
> - Summation potential: Vibration of the basilar membrane
> - Summation action potential of the auditory nerve
> 

> [!NOTE] Otoacoustic Emissions
> Otoacoustic emissions are retrograde sound signals caused by the contraction of the outer hair cells. Sensitive microphones can measure the signals in the external auditory canal. This allows for an objective assessment of hearing ability that does not depend on the cooperation of the patients and is therefore often used with children. The measurement of the OAE is routinely performed, for example, on newborns as part of the U2 screening.

## Central Auditory Pathway

### Hörbahn

The auditory pathway transmits acoustic information from the auditory organ to the primary auditory cortex. It consists of core areas as well as ascending and descending fiber pathways. The auditory nerve (N. cochlearis) is synaptically connected to the base of the sensory cells synaptically and forms the beginning of the auditory pathway.

- Pathway of central stimulus transmission (simplified representation): Hair cells → Cochlear nerve → Cochlear nuclei → (Superior olivary nucleus) → Inferior colliculi → Medial geniculate body → Primary auditory cortex
- Crossing fibers: The fibers of the auditory pathway partially cross at several stations (important for directional hearing).

### Encoding of Acoustic Information

An acoustic stimulus contains different information such as tone frequency, intensity, duration, direction, and distance from the source. For the perception of acoustic stimuli in the central nervous system, this information must be encoded. Several mechanisms exist for this purpose.

1. Encoding of the tone frequency
    - Principle: Frequency-Location Mapping
    - Short description: Each tone frequency has exactly one optimal mapping location on the basilar membrane
    - Background: The basilar membrane becomes wider and thinner towards the helicotrema.
    - Result: Tone frequency is translated into location.
        - High frequencies (= high tones): Near the base of the cochlea (membrane narrower and stiffer)
        - Low frequencies (= deep tones): Near the Helicotrema (membrane wider, less tense)
    - Special feature: The frequency-location mapping occurs from the hair cell to higher auditory centers.
2. Encoding of the sound pressure (simplified representation)
    - Short description
        - The level of the sound pressure level (=volume) is encoded over the discharge frequency.
        - This mechanism occurs through the additional recruitment of neighboring fibers.
    - Background
        - A fiber cannot exceed a certain discharge frequency.
        - If the sound pressure level continues to rise, the information about the recruitment of neighboring fibers is encoded.
        - Example
            - Quiet tones: Only the fibers with the respective best frequency
            - Increasing volume: The number of action potentials increases in the fibers.
            - Further increase (when exceeding the maximum frequency for a fiber): Neighboring fibers are recruited.
    - Result: Sound pressure level (= Volume) is encoded through the discharge frequency.

### Directional Hearing

The direction of a sound source can be calculated using the central auditory system (see also video in Tips & Links).

- Requirement: Binaural Hearing
- Important junctions: Superior olive nucleus and Inferior colliculi
    - Receive acoustic information from both ears
    - Compare the effects of action potentials that come from both sides.
- Mechanisms
    - Duration difference
    - Morphology of the auricle
        - Sound signals are distorted to varying degrees depending on the direction of incidence.
        - The distorted sound patterns can be recognized centrally.
- Result
    - Very high sensitivity of directional hearing
    - A deviation of the sound source by 3° from the centerline can already be detected.
## Audiometry

In audiometric diagnostics, various testing methods can determine the location and extent of hearing loss. Hearing loss can arise from disturbances in the outer ear canal, middle ear, or inner ear as well as centrally in the area of the auditory pathway. Depending on the origin of the disturbance, hearing loss is classified into sensorineural hearing loss (disturbance in the inner ear or the area of the auditory nerve) and conductive hearing loss (disturbance in the middle ear or outer ear canal). Subjective testing methods (which rely on the active participation of the patient) are distinguished from objective testing methods.

### Basics

- Hearing impairment is divided into:
    - Auditory processing disorder: The cause of hearing loss is a disturbance of the inner ear due to loss of hair cell function (cochlear) or a disturbance of the auditory nerve (retrocochlear).
        - Example: Age-related hearing loss (Presbycusis)
            - Definition: Age-related hearing loss due to degeneration of the Corti organ
            - Clinic: Progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss particularly of high frequencies
            - Findings from the tone audiogram: The curve typically shows a drop in the high-frequency range while maintaining good hearing in the low-frequency range.
    - Conductive Hearing Loss: The cause of the hearing loss lies in one of the sound-conducting structures of the ear, usually in the middle ear or the outer ear canal.

### Subjective audiometric procedures

Subjective audiometric procedures require the active participation of the patient. The simplest subjective procedures are the tuning fork tests according to Rinne and Weber, which allow for a preliminary distinction between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss.

#### Rinne Test

- Short description
    - Test of sound conduction in both ears by comparing the respective hearing threshold
    - For air and bone conduction
- Implementation
    - A vibrating tuning fork is placed on an ear on the mastoid process.
    - When the sound has faded to the point that the patient can no longer hear it, the tuning fork is held in front of the corresponding ear without being struck again.
- Interpretation
    - With normal sound conduction, the patient would hear the tuning fork again as soon as it is held in front of the ear, since air conducts better than bone: The Rinne test would then be positive.
        - Negative Rinne test
            - Air conduction no better than bone conduction: indication of a conductive hearing loss of the tested ear
        - Positive Rinne test
            - Air conduction better than bone conduction: Physiologically and in cases of sensorineural hearing loss of the tested ear

#### Weber Test

- Short description
    - Test of the skull bone conduction
    - The Weber test is used to investigate unilateral hearing loss to determine whether it is a conduction or a sensorineural hearing disorder.
- Implementation
    - The struck tuning fork is placed on the center of the skull.
    - The patient is then asked which ear he hears the sound better in.
- Interpretation: If the patient does not indicate a side with hearing impairment during lateralization in the Weber test, a differentiation can be made between a conductive hearing loss and a sensorineural hearing disorder in conjunction with the Rinne test.
    - No lateralization: Physiological and in cases of bilateral hearing loss (same origin)
    - Lateralization in the normally hearing (or Rinne-positive tested) ear: Indicates a sensorineural hearing loss on the opposite side.
    - Lateralization in the hearing-impaired (or Rinne negative tested) ear: indication of a conductive hearing disorder on this side

#### Tone Threshold Audiometry

- Short description
    - Subjective test for determining frequency-dependent hearing threshold through measurement of air and bone conduction.
    - Statements can be made about the extent of the hearing impairment as well as about the cause (sensorineural or conductive hearing loss).
- Implementation
    - The patient is presented with sounds of various frequencies through headphones (air conduction) and a bone conduction headphone (bone conduction).
    - The volume is increased for each individual frequency in 5 dB steps.
    - The patient gives a predetermined signal (e.g. raises a finger or presses a button) as soon as he hears the sound.
    - The hearing thresholds of the individual frequencies are marked on an audiogram form (high to low tones).
- Interpretation
    - The connection of the individual auditory threshold points results in an auditory threshold curve for air and bone conduction.
    - This allows the hearing loss for each frequency to be read.
        - In the case of a conductive hearing loss (middle ear damage), the hearing threshold for air conduction is elevated, but the hearing threshold for bone conduction is normal (exception: Carhart notch in otosclerosis).
        - In a sound perception disorder (cochlear or retrocochlear damage), the hearing threshold is equally elevated for air and bone conduction.

### Objective audiometric procedures

Objective audiometric procedures assess hearing based on 'objective' parameters. For this purpose, physiological and involuntary reactions are measured, which are not under the patient's control and do not require the patient's assistance.

#### Electric Response Audiometry (Elektrische Reaktionsaudiometrie, ERA)

- Description
    - The electrical reaction audiometry is a general term for procedures used to measure acoustically evoked potentials that can be recorded in the EEG.
    - By comparing runtime with standard tables, topographical information about the lesion site of the hearing impairment can be made (topodiagnostics).
    - The standard procedures of electrical reaction audiometry include brainstem audiometry (BERA) and cortical audiometry (CERA).
- Indication
    - Suspicion of retrocochlear disorders
    - Objective determination of hearing thresholds in children or non-cooperative patients (also suitable for newborn screening)
- Implementation
    - Acoustic stimuli are presented to the patient through headphones.
    - Through a derivation electrode on the Mastoid and Vertex (crown), early, middle, and late potentials are now generated - depending on the procedure.
- Standard procedure
    - The classification of the procedures depends on the timing of the occurrence of the auditory evoked potentials after the sound stimulus.
        - Hirnstammaudiometrie = Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA)
            - Derivation of early auditory evoked potentials (FAEP): 1.5–10.0 ms after the sound stimulus (with a very short waveform duration of less than 10ms)
            - Acoustic potentials of brainstem audiometry are represented in the form of 5 waves.
                - Waves 1 and 2 are attributed to the proximal part of the N. cochlearis.
                - Waves 3 to 5 reflect the course of the auditory pathway in the brainstem.
        - Hirnrindenaudiometrie = Cortical Evoked Response Audiometry (CERA)
            - Derivation of late and very late auditory evoked potentials: 100–300 ms and 300–1000 ms after the sound stimulus

#### Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE)

- Short description
    - Otoacoustic emissions are physiological sound emissions from the cochlea that occur spontaneously or in response to acoustic stimulation and can be measured in the ear canal.
    - Based on their measurement, a functional test of the cochlea can be carried out.
    - One distinguishes:
        - Spontaneous OAE (SOAE): Physiological, acoustic sound emissions that are emitted by the outer hair cells of the ear and reach the ear canal retrogradely through the ossicles and tympanic membrane
        - Transiently evoked OAE (TEOAE): Otoacoustic emissions that are triggered by a brief stimulus (click)
- Indication: Method of choice for newborn hearing screening (TEOAE)
- Implementation: Measurement of otoacoustic emissions in the external auditory canal by recording with very sensitive microphones.
- Interpretation
    - If otoacoustic emissions are measurable, the function of the outer hair cells is normal.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Auditory System
### Peripheral Hearing Perception

How do sound waves travel from their arrival at the outer ear to the stimulus transmission in the inner ear?
- Sound waves travel through the outer auditory canal to the eardrum via air conduction. From there, the transmission continues via the ossicular chain from the malleus (hammer) to the incus (anvil) and then to the stapes (stirrup), which then exerts pressure on the oval window. Since the perilymph in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani is incompressible, the sound pressure is released back into the middle ear at the round window. Thus, a traveling wave arises from the scala vestibuli over the helicotrema and scala tympani to the round window, which also deflects the basilar membrane.

What mechanisms prevent sound wave loss between the eardrum and the inner ear?
- When sound energy hits the interface of two media (e.g., air and water), it is mostly reflected and absorbed. However, two mechanisms prevent this loss of sound waves between the air-filled middle ear and the fluid-filled scala vestibuli: On the one hand, the reduction of the transmission area from the eardrum to the stapes footplate leads to an increase in pressure; on the other hand, the ossicles arranged in series exert an additional lever effect.

What is the function of the inner and the outer hair cells?
- The inner hair cells are responsible for stimulus perception; neuronal signals (afferent potentials of the cochlear nerve) arise from the traveling waves. The outer hair cells, on the other hand, serve to amplify sound in a specific range. They thereby increase the ability to distinguish frequencies, which is especially important for speech comprehension.

What happens during the transduction of sound waves at the hair cells?
- The vibrations of the organ of Corti cause mechanical shear movements of the stereocilia of the hair cells. This leads to a stretching of the "tip links," resulting in an influx of K+ ions into the hair cell and depolarization of the cell.

### Central Auditory Pathway

Which is the 1st neuron of the central auditory pathway and where is it located?
- The first neuron of the central auditory pathway is the spiral ganglion. It is located in the modiolus of the cochlea. Its central processes form the cochlear nerve.

Name the relay stations of the auditory pathway from the 1st neuron.
- The stations of the auditory pathway are: spiral ganglion (1st neuron), cochlear nuclei (2nd neuron), superior olivary nuclei (3rd neuron, optional), the fiber tract of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculi (3rd/4th neuron), the fiber tract brachium of the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body (4th/5th neuron), and finally the primary auditory cortex.

What is the function of the lateral lemniscus?
- The fiber tract of the lateral lemniscus connects the posterior cochlear nucleus or the superior olivary nucleus with the inferior colliculi.

How is a sound frequency encoded as acoustic information?
- The tone frequency of an acoustic stimulus is encoded according to the frequency-place principle. This means that each audible frequency causes a maximum amplitude at exactly one place on the basilar membrane.

Where are high and low frequencies represented?
- The lower a frequency, the closer its maximum is to the helicotrema; the higher the frequency, the closer it is to the cochlear base. This is because the basilar membrane becomes narrower and stiffer from the helicotrema toward the cochlear base.

What are the important control points for directional hearing and what is the main mechanism involved?
- For binaural hearing (directional hearing), the superior olivary nucleus and the inferior colliculi are responsible. They determine the time differences at which action potentials arrive from both sides. These differences arise because ipsilateral action potentials arrive faster on the ipsilateral side than on the contralateral side. From the temporal difference between both sides, the location of the sound source can be precisely determined.

### Audiometry

What are the two types of hearing loss that are distinguished and where are their anatomical correlates located?
- In hearing loss, conductive hearing loss is distinguished from sensorineural hearing loss. In conductive hearing loss, the impairment lies in the sound-conducting structures, usually in the middle ear or outer auditory canal. In sensorineural hearing loss, the impairment involves the inner ear, either due to loss of hair cell function (cochlear) or due to a disorder of the auditory nerve itself (retrocochlear).

To what type of hearing loss does presbycusis belong, and how can it be identified in the tone audiogram?
- Presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is a bilateral, progressive form of sensorineural hearing loss. Characteristic of presbycusis is the loss of perception of high frequencies. This leads to a drop in the curve in the high-tone range in the tone audiogram; low tones can still be well perceived.

What audiometric methods do you know, and which of them are objective and which are subjective?
- Subjective audiometric methods include the Rinne test, the Weber test, and pure tone audiometry. Objective audiometric methods include electrical response audiometry (ERA) and the measurement of otoacoustic emissions (OAE).

What is tested in the Rinne test and how is it interpreted?
- In the Rinne test, the air and bone conduction of both ears are tested. It is called positive if air conduction is better than bone conduction. This can be physiological or occur in sensorineural hearing loss of the tested ear. The Rinne test is negative if air conduction is not better than bone conduction. This indicates a conductive hearing loss of the tested ear.

What is tested in the Weber test and how is it interpreted?
- The Weber test tests bone conduction. Physiologically or with bilateral hearing loss, the tone is heard equally well on both sides (no lateralization). Lateralization, i.e., the tone is heard louder on one side than the other, into the healthy ear (Rinne test positive) indicates sensorineural hearing loss on the opposite side. Lateralization to the affected ear (Rinne test negative) suggests a conductive hearing loss on that side.

How is the hearing threshold altered in a case of sound sensitivity disorder?
- In sensorineural hearing loss (cochlear or retrocochlear damage), the hearing threshold for air and bone conduction is equally elevated.

What is meant by electrical reaction audiometry and what is measured in this process?
- Electrical response audiometry (ERA) is an objective measurement method to test the hearing ability of the cochlea, auditory pathway, brainstem, and auditory cortex. In suspected retrocochlear disorders, acoustic stimuli are recorded as early acoustic evoked potentials (EAEP) using EEG. Depending on the measurement site, a distinction is made between brainstem audiometry (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA)) and cortical audiometry (Cortical Evoked Response Audiometry (CERA)). In BERA, the normal value for the time between stimulus and potential recording in the EEG is between 1.5–10 ms. The EAEPs should not exceed a maximum length of 10 ms. In CERA, late to very late acoustic evoked potentials are recorded; up to 1,000 ms may pass until the recording after the sound stimulus. This method is used, for example, in non-cooperative patients and young children suspected of retrocochlear damage.
