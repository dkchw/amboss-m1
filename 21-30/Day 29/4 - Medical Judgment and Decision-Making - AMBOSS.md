# Medical Judgment and Decision-Making
## Summary

The process of making decisions is especially important in the medical profession. Medical decisions carry significant weight and are not always easy to make. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of the fundamentals and types of diagnostic decisions. Additionally, every physician should regularly assess the quality of their decisions and be aware of potential decision conflicts and errors to ensure optimal patient care.

The diagnostic process involves gathering information, based on which a question is formulated and ultimately a hypothesis is derived. A diagnosis can subsequently be uniformly formulated with the help of classification systems. The two most important classification systems are the ICD-10 and the DSM-5.

In the further course, diagnosis and decision should always be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
## Fundamentals of Diagnostic Decision-Making

### The Diagnostic Process

The diagnostic process begins with a question posed by a commissioning person to the diagnostician. The diagnostician formulates a testable hypothesis from this, collects and interprets the necessary data to answer the question, and, if possible, establishes a diagnosis as the basis for subsequent treatment. If the data is insufficient, the process is repeated, and the hypothesis may be adjusted accordingly.

> [!NOTE]
> The diagnostic process takes place in several steps: Questioning → Hypothesis formation → Data collection → Data interpretation → Diagnosis → Treatment decision!

#### Formulating a Research Question

- Question that captures the patient's complaints
- Example: Does my patient have stomach pain because he is suffering from a stomach ulcer? What could be the causes of this stomach ulcer?

#### Forming a Hypothesis

- Formulate hypotheses as concretely and operationally as possible.
- In continuation: Proceeding with diagnostics according to the established hypothesis.

#### Gathering Information

- Information sources
    - Anamnesis (see: Examination and Conversation)
    - Findings and prior findings
    - Test results
    - Distinction between hard (objective) data and soft (subjective) data

> [!NOTE] Lying scale
> A source of error that the doctor should be aware of when gathering information is the tendency toward social desirability. Patients tend to give answers in conversations or surveys that they believe are desired by society. However, these answers do not correspond to the truth. To better assess whether a patient is answering the questions truthfully, a so-called lie scale can be used. The principle here is to incorporate questions about small "weaknesses" or "mistakes" into the survey, which almost every person would have to affirm if answering honestly (e.g., "Have you ever told a white lie?"). If these questions are denied, it can be assumed that the other responses are also less honest.

### Classification Systems

With the help of classification systems, the diagnosis is simplified. Several classification systems exist, three of which will be exemplarily presented below.

#### Functions of the Classification Systems

- Standardization of diagnoses
- Improved comparability of diagnoses
- Simplified documentation of diagnoses
- More precise communication among colleagues
- Simplified derivation of therapy recommendations
- Simplified billing

#### Features of the Classification Systems

- Operationalized: Creating the diagnosis based on operationalized (i.e., measurable) criteria
- Criteria-oriented: Creating the diagnosis based on predefined criteria
- Multiaxial: Creating the diagnosis considering multiple axes
- Atheoretical: Creating the diagnosis without reference to possible causes of the disease

> [!NOTE] Comorbidity
> In clinical practice, patients often suffer not only from one condition. If there is one or more additional conditions alongside the primary condition, it is referred to as comorbidity. The "additional conditions" are also listed as separate diagnoses.

#### Examples of Classification Systems

Diagnoses can be assigned and coded based on various classification systems; the basis for evaluation here is the symptomatology. The most important ones include the ICD and DSM classifications.

##### ICD-10 and ICD-11

- Name: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems
- Application
    - Classification of physical and mental illnesses
    - International Use
- Relevance
    - ICD-11: Came into effect in January 2022
    - ICD-10 in Germany, however, remains the valid official classification.
- Structure of ICD-10
    - An axis (diagnosis of the current illness)
    - 22 chapters organized alphabetically (e.g., mental disorders: Chapter V (coding F00-F99))
- Scale level: Nominal scale

> [!NOTE]
> Practicing physicians and hospitals in Germany are required to code diagnoses according to the ICD-10 criteria!

> [!NOTE] Criteria of the Dependence Syndrome according to ICD-10
> The following are exemplary criteria of the dependence syndrome according to ICD-10. In order to diagnose a dependence syndrome, at least three of these criteria must be met according to ICD-10.
> 
> - Substance demand
> - Difficulties in controlling consumption
> - Physical withdrawal syndrome
> - Development of tolerance towards the substance
> - Neglecting other interests
> - Persistent substance use despite evidence of harmful consequences

##### DSM-5

- Name: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition)
- Application
    - Classification of Mental Disorders
    - Use in the USA
- Structure: 20 main diagnostic groups, which can partially be divided into further subgroups (the previous version of the DSM-5, the DSM-IV, systematized the disorders based on five axes – this multiaxial system was abandoned in the DSM-5. Additionally, classification now occurs in Arabic numerals.).

##### ICF

Since the extent of functional impairment due to an illness varies significantly from patient to patient, the WHO has developed an International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in addition to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). It is used within the framework of rehabilitation measures. See also → "Prevention and Health Promotion".
## Types of Diagnostic Decision

### Fundamental Terms

- Diagnose (from Greek diágnosis = "discriminating assessment", "recognition"): Term for a disease
- Diagnostics (from Greek diagnōstikós = "belonging to distinguishing"): The study and art of recognizing diseases.

### Forms of Diagnostics

The following presents the different types of diagnostic decision-making during the course of a treatment.

#### Indications Diagnosis

- Explanation: Diagnostics at the beginning of treatment
- Goal: Determine which treatment is necessary (indicated).
- Example: A pneumonia is diagnosed in a patient. Subsequently, an antibiotic therapy is initiated.

#### Process Diagnostics

- Explanation: Diagnostics in the course of treatment
- Goal: Individual assessment of the treatment course and adjustment of the therapy to the treatment course (adaptive diagnostics)
- Methods
    - Indirect change measurement: Forming the difference between characteristics collected at two different points in time
    - Direct change measurement: Assessment of the subjectively experienced change using comparative statements (e.g. "better," "worse")
- Example: In the course of treatment, the patient's symptoms worsen. Subsequently, the antibiotic therapy is escalated.

#### Outcome Diagnostics (Outcome-Diagnostics)

- Explanation: Diagnostics after the completion of therapy
- Goal: Assessing therapy success by comparing it with previously established therapy agreements and objectives.
- Example: The fever and the signs of pneumonia on the X-ray have decreased. The treatment was successful.

> [!NOTE]
> The diagnosis is not made once at the beginning of the treatment. It should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary throughout the course!

> [!NOTE] Labeling
> When a diagnosis is made, the patient may be assigned a label. This can be both burdensome and relieving for the patient. For example, a patient may feel relieved if he is no longer seen as a "drunk" in front of his family but is officially diagnosed with an alcoholism. However, the label can also be a burden, for instance, if the mental illness is listed in his personnel file.

## Judgment Quality and Quality Control

### Judgment Quality

The quality of a judgment depends on various criteria. If decisions are made in the context of diagnostics, for example, using tests, it is important that these tests meet certain quality criteria. These so-called test quality criteria are explained in the chapter "Fundamentals of Medical Statistics." If a test does not meet these criteria, it is only partially usable. Similarly, the result of a diagnosis must be questioned if, for example, two doctors arrive at different outcomes, and thus there is no agreement among evaluators. Finally, the type of conclusion should always be taken into account. If it is, for example, necessary to arrive at a diagnosis as quickly as possible, it is advisable to reason linearly and only gather information that is relevant to the suspected diagnosis. However, one must always be aware that important information can sometimes be overlooked with this type of reasoning.

#### Test Quality Criteria

Diagnostic decisions made based on tests must meet quality criteria. These so-called test quality criteria are explained in detail in the chapter "Fundamentals of Medical Statistics."

#### Rater Agreement

- Explanation: The same situation can lead to different diagnoses among different doctors.
- Verification: Statistical indicators can be calculated to determine how reliable a statement is.
    - Cohen's Kappa: With the help of the statistical measure Cohen's Kappa, it is calculated to what extent two statements agree beyond pure chance.

#### Types of Conclusion

The way a conclusion is drawn affects the quality of that conclusion. Depending on the specific situation, it must be determined which type of conclusion is the most sensible in the concrete circumstance.

##### Additive Conclusion

- Implementation
    - All necessary information is initially gathered.
    - Subsequently, all information is added to create a comprehensive picture.
- Advantage: Comprehensive
- Disadvantage: Time-consuming, sometimes unnecessary information is collected
- Example: A patient presents with abdominal pain. The doctor gathers all information that may be important regarding this symptom. He asks the patient, among other things, about the intensity of the discomfort, its location, and when it started. Only after he has collected all the information does he interpret it, draw conclusions about a possible diagnosis, and initiate further diagnostic steps.

##### Linear Conclusion

- Implementation
    - The information is collected adaptively, step by step.
    - The doctor asks his questions based on the suspected diagnosis that arises from the patient's answers.
- Advantage: Targeted, less time-consuming
- Disadvantage: Risk of neglecting or overlooking important information
- Example: A patient presents with abdominal pain. The doctor asks him about the location of the complaints. A location typical for an inflammation of the pancreas emerges. The doctor now aligns his further approach with this suspected diagnosis and asks the patient about his alcohol consumption, as this is a common cause of pancreatitis, and collects decisive laboratory values of pancreatitis.

### Quality Control of Diagnostic Decisions

Since diagnostic decisions can sometimes have very significant consequences, the quality of these decisions should be regularly reviewed. This can potentially improve the course of therapy and determine whether there is indeed an indication for this therapy. There are a number of quality control options, a selection of which will be presented below.

#### Progress Observation and Success Measurement

- Implementation: Documentation and evaluation of the most important disease parameters during the course of treatment or after the completion of treatment.
- Condition: Criteria for success must be defined in advance.
- Objective: Determine therapy success

#### Katamnese (Follow-Up)

- Implementation:
    - Follow-up examinations weeks, months, or years after the completion of treatment
    - If possible, the results should be compared with earlier studies and/or results from other forms of therapy.
- Goal: To assess whether a treatment was also effective in the long term.

> [!NOTE]
> Medical decisions can sometimes have very far-reaching consequences! Therefore, every doctor should regularly evaluate the quality of their decisions and improve them if necessary!

## Decision Conflicts and Decision Errors

### Causes of Decision Conflicts and Decision Errors

When decisions are made, there is always the risk of decision conflicts and decision errors. The way decisions are made can encourage or reduce decision conflicts and errors.

#### Type of Decision-Making

The way a decision is made can be a cause of decision conflicts. For example, a directive leadership style can lead to employees feeling overlooked in decisions. However, the manner of decision-making also influences how decision conflicts are dealt with and resolved in the further course. The participative leadership style can contribute here by turning a disagreement into an enrichment that allows for new or different perspectives.

##### Leadership Style

- Directive leadership style
    - Meaning: Decisions are made solely at the highest hierarchical level.
    - Advantage: Time-saving
    - Disadvantages
        - Risk of a poor working atmosphere, as employees may sometimes feel overlooked
        - Employees' experiences and knowledge remain untapped.
- Participative leadership style
    - Meaning: All hierarchical levels are involved in decision-making.
    - Advantages
        - Good working atmosphere, as employees feel valued
        - Experiences and knowledge of the employees are utilized
    - Disadvantages
        - Time-consuming
        - Requires social and communication skills

> [!NOTE] Collegial decision-making
> Under a participative leadership style, there is the possibility of collegial decision-making, as long as no expert is available for a specific issue. In the spirit of collegial decision-making, all participants are encouraged to share their knowledge and experiences in order to come to a solution together.

##### Forms of Authority

- Functional Authority
    - It becomes especially familiar with the views of a professional or the person with the greatest knowledge regarding the current issue.
- Positional Authority
    - It is primarily the views of the hierarchically highest authority that are trusted.

#### Commitment to Individual and Collective Well-Being

- On the one hand, the obligation to treat each individual patient in the best possible way.
- On the other hand, there is a commitment to the public to use existing resources in their interest.

> [!NOTE] Obligation to individual and general well-being
> A conflict of decision often arises at this point for financial reasons. For example, in Germany, there is a discussion about performing certain operative procedures only up to a certain age limit in order to save costs in the interest of the general public.

#### Benefit-risk assessment and weighing between equivalent treatment alternatives

- Weighing the benefits and risks before every decision is necessary.
- Partial weighing between seemingly equivalent treatment alternatives is required.
- Weighing the benefits and risks, as well as between equivalent treatment alternatives, can be facilitated by incorporating information from meta-analyses
    - Meta-analyses: Compiling and statistically analyzing results from multiple studies to draw conclusions about the efficacy of a therapy.

#### Decisions Based on Uncertain Information

- Often, decisions must be made in medicine even though not all necessary information or only unclear findings are available.
- Reasons
    - Pressure to act
    - Actions necessary for diagnostics

### Types of Decision Errors

#### Assessment and Observation Errors

The impression of the doctor can be influenced and possibly distorted by various factors, such as the appearance or demeanor of the patient or by comparison with other patients. This can lead to so-called observation and assessment errors.

#### Judgment Heuristics

Heuristics are initially referred to as rules of thumb. The following are two judgment heuristics that can lead to decision-making errors.

- Availability heuristics
    - Information currently available/accessible in memory will be utilized
    - Example: Assigning a diagnosis because the symptoms of the current patient match those of the last patients with this diagnosis.
    - Common diagnoses are easily recognized.
    - Rare diagnoses can, however, be overlooked.
- Anchor or adjustment heuristics
    - Unilateral search for information based on an already existing suspicion
    - Information that does not fit the existing suspicion is sometimes overlooked.

#### Context Effects

- Decisions are mostly made based on information. Depending on how the information is presented, this can influence the decision-making process.
- Example: If a screening test is presented and reference is made to a very rare side effect instead of the significant benefit of the test, patients are more likely to opt out of the test.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Medical Judgment and Decision Making
### Fundamentals of Diagnostic Decision-Making

What is a so-called lie scale and when is it used?
- Patients partly tend to give answers to questions that they believe are socially desirable but do not actually correspond to the truth. To better assess whether a patient answers the questions truthfully, a so-called lie scale can be used. For this, the questioner includes questions about small “weaknesses” or “mistakes” that (almost) everyone would have to answer “yes” to when answering honestly (e.g., “Have you ever used a white lie?”). If these questions are answered with “no,” it can be assumed that the rest of the questions were answered less honestly as well.

What is the purpose of classification systems like ICD-10 or DSM-5 and how are the two systems structured?
- Classification systems like ICD-10 or DSM-5 help assign and encode diagnoses. Since they provide criteria that must be met in order to make a specific diagnosis, they are also called operational diagnostic systems. The basis is the patient’s symptomatology. The ICD-10 system consists of one axis, namely the diagnosis of the current disease. The DSM-5 system is composed of 20 main diagnostic groups, some of which are divided into further subgroups. Both systems are on a nominal scale level, as they are purely a listing of diseases that cannot be put into any order. In Germany, outpatient doctors and hospitals are obliged to encode diagnoses using the ICD-10 criteria.

What are the ICD-10 criteria for the dependency syndrome and how many criteria must be met to make the diagnosis?
- The criteria of the dependency syndrome according to ICD-10 are substance craving, difficulties controlling consumption, physical withdrawal syndrome, tolerance development toward the substance, neglect of other interests, and continued substance use despite proven harmful consequences. At least three of these criteria must be met to make the diagnosis of a dependency syndrome.

What is meant by “comorbidity”?
- If a patient suffers from one or more additional diseases besides their primary illness, this is called comorbidity.

### Judgment Quality and Quality Control

What is a catamnesis?
- A catamnesis is a follow-up examination that can occur weeks, months, or years after treatment completion and checks whether the treatment was successful.

### Decision Conflicts and Decision Errors

What characterizes a doctor who uses anchor heuristics?
- Heuristics are rules of thumb that help to reach a decision despite incomplete information. If a person uses anchoring or adjustment heuristics, they search very selectively for information starting from an already existing suspicion—information that does not fit the existing suspicion may even be overlooked. For example, if a doctor gets the impression during the first meeting that the patient suffers from a depressive disorder, it may happen that he thereafter only asks questions regarding this symptomatology and ends the conversation convinced that he has found the correct diagnosis. That the patient also has symptoms of an eating disorder can thereby be overlooked.
