# Adrenal Gland
## Summary

The adrenal glands are paired endocrine glands that sit atop the kidneys and are involved in the production of vital hormones. In the cortex, cortisol is produced, which can increase blood sugar levels, aldosterone, which regulates the body's salt and fluid balance through the kidneys, and to a lesser extent, androgens. In the adrenal medulla, particularly the stress hormone adrenaline is produced, which helps maintain circulation in stressful situations. By the way, you can also find a Histo-Trainer episode on the adrenal gland as part of the episode on endocrine organs in the microscopic anatomy section of the adrenal gland.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function: Biosynthesis and secretion of steroid hormones (cortex) and catecholamines (medulla)
- Location
    - At the upper pole of both kidneys
    - Primary retroperitoneal
    - Within the renal fat capsule
- Construction
    - Surrounded by delicate connective tissue capsule
    - Outer, larger bark zone
    - Inner, smaller market zone
- Shape: Right triangular, left crescent-shaped
- Size: Approximately 5 cm long and thick, about 1â€“2 cm wide

### Topography

The two adrenal glands are located at the level of the 11th and 12th thoracic vertebrae, with the right adrenal gland positioned slightly more caudally. The positional relationships to the neighboring organs differ depending on the side:

- Both adrenal glands
    - Caudal: Upper renal pole
    - Dorsal: Diaphragm
- Left adrenal gland
    - Ventral: Separated from the posterior wall of the stomach by the omental bursa.
- Right adrenal gland
    - Ventrocranial: Liver
    - Ventromedial: Inferior vena cava

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

The adrenal glands are highly vascularized to ensure a rapid transfer of hormones into the blood. The blood flows from the cortex to the medulla, so the medulla is exposed to high concentrations of adrenal cortex hormones.

## Microscopic Anatomy

### Adrenal Cortex

The adrenal cortex consists of three zones that differ in the arrangement of their cells and the hormones produced. Histologically, the epithelial cells of the adrenal cortex exhibit typical characteristics of steroid hormone-producing cells (e.g., cholesterol storage and well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum).

### Adrenal Medulla

The adrenal medulla consists of modified second sympathetic neurons that are innervated by first sympathetic neurons of the spinal cord via cholinergic synapses. The function of the adrenal medulla cells, like that of postganglionic sympathetic neurons, is catecholamine production.

- Histological components
    - Modified sympathetic neurons
    - Nerve fibers (microscopically visible)
    - Glial cells
- Histological cell characteristics
    - Large, chromaffin cells with many secretory granules (for catecholamine storage)
    - Throttle veins

### Hormones of the Adrenal Cortex

Cholesterol is the precursor substance for all hormones produced in the adrenal cortex and possesses a steroid structure. This gives the cortical hormones their name: steroid hormones. Due to their lipophilic nature, they are membrane-permeable and exert their effects intracellularly by influencing transcription. The steroid structure (C17H28) consists of three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring.

    - Cholesterol
    - Estradiol
    - Cholic acid ( a main component of bile acid; rings A and B are cis-linked)

### Basics of Steroid Hormone Synthesis

In steroid hormone synthesis, the common precursor of all steroid hormones is cholesterol. It is stored in the hormone-producing cells of the adrenal cortex in the form of lipid droplets of cholesterol esters. Cholesterol can be recovered from the cholesterol esters through hydrolysis. The synthesis pathways of the various steroid hormones (mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens) diverge after some common fundamental reactions.

- Common basic reaction of steroid hormone synthesis: Conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone
- Key enzyme: Cholesterol desmolase
- Principle: Removal of the side chain with 6 C-atoms by cleaving the bond between the C-atoms 20 and 22 of cholesterol â†’ In this process, the side chain from C22 to C27 is oxidatively cleaved.

### Mineralocorticoid

Mineralocorticoids belong to the group of steroid hormones and are synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Their most important representative is aldosterone, which serves to regulate water and electrolyte balance and thus primarily affects blood pressure.

### Aldosterone Synthesis

- Aldosterone structure: steroid hormone with 21 carbon atoms
- Starting material: Pregnenolone
- Synthesizing location: Zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex
- Process: Pregnenolone â†’ Progesterone â†’ 11-Deoxycorticosterone â†’ Aldosterone

#### Synthesis Steps

The aldosterone synthesis occurs through numerous intermediate steps. At this point, only the relevant steps will be addressed.

| 1. Oxidation and rearrangement of the double bond | - Pregnenolone (21 C)    | - 3Î²-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase | - Progesterone (21 C)           |
| 2. Hydroxylation                                  | - Progesterone           | - 21-Hydroxylase                  | - 11-Deoxycorticosterone (21 C) |

> [!NOTE]
> The aldehyde group in position 18 of the ring structure gives aldosterone its name!

> [!NOTE]
> The hydroxylases involved in steroid synthesis are also referred to as "monooxygenases" in the literature. However, the term "hydroxylase" is uniformly used here!

### Aldosterone Metabolism

Aldosterone is part of the so-called renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which regulates sodium, potassium, and fluid balance.

- Transport: Bound to albumin in the blood
- Breakdown: In the liver (excretion via bile into the intestine)
- Regulation
    - Main stimulators of secretion
        - Angiotensin II
        - K+-concentration in blood plasma
    - Inhibitor of secretion: ANP

### Effect

- Location: Tubule cell in the distal tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct of the kidney
- Molecular mechanism of action
    - Receptor: Cytosolic Mineralocorticoid Receptor
        - Belongs to the ligand-activated transcription factors
        - Identical to the cortisol type 1 receptor (see below)
    - Process
        - Diffusion of aldosterone from the blood into the cytosol of the tubular cells of the kidney
        - Complex of cytosolic mineralocorticoid receptor and aldosterone diffuses into the cell nucleus and acts there as a transcription factor.
    - Mediation of early effects (after about 30 min): Through the expression of Serum- and Glucocorticoid-inducible Kinase (SGK)
    - Mediation of later effects (after a few hours): Stimulation of the biosynthesis of the affected molecules (see below)
    - Effects of both paths
        - Installation of the Na+/K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane â†’ Transports Na+ out and K+ into the tubular cell
        - Installation of Na+ channels ENaC (Epithelial Sodium Channel) and K+ channels ROMK (Renal outer medullary Potassium Channel) in the luminal membrane
        - Installation of an apical H+-ATPase in the luminal membrane of type A intercalated cells
- Effect: Sodium and water reabsorptionâ†‘ as well as potassium and proton excretionâ†‘

> [!NOTE]
> Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidney!

> [!NOTE] Hyper- and Hypoaldosteronism
> Through hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex, there can be a significantly increased secretion of aldosterone (primary hyperaldosteronism, Conn's disease). As a result, the kidneys excessively reabsorb sodium and water, leading to an increase in intravascular volume and thus elevated blood pressure in those affected. Due to the increased excretion of potassium and protons, the potassium level in the blood can simultaneously drop, leading to metabolic alkalosis. In contrast, in hypoaldosteronism (a deficiency of mineralocorticoids, for example, in adrenal insufficiency as part of Addison's disease), there is hypotonic dehydration as well as reduced potassium and proton excretion with metabolic acidosis.

### Glucocorticoid

Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones with a variety of essential life-sustaining effects. They are also called "stress hormones" because they support the body in times of particular strain (e.g., severe physical exertion or psychological stress) by, for example, raising blood sugar levels or increasing blood pressure. In clinical settings, synthetic glucocorticoids are commonly used as medications. The most important representative in humans is cortisol. Cortisone refers to the inactive form of cortisol.

### Cortisol Biosynthesis

- Cortisol structure: Steroid hormone with 21 carbon atoms
- Starting material: Cholesterol
- Key enzyme: 21-Hydroxylase
- Important cofactor: Vitamin C
- Synthesis site: Zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex
- Synthesis steps (abbreviated): Cholesterol â†’ Pregnenolone â†’ 17Î±-Hydroxyprogesterone â†’ Cortisol

#### Synthesis Steps

Cortisol is formed like all steroid hormones from cholesterol via the intermediate pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is converted either into progesterone or into 17Î±-hydroxypregnenolone. Both synthesis pathways yield the product 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone, which is converted by 21-hydroxylase into 11-deoxycortisol, from which cortisol is produced.

### Cortisol Metabolism

- Transport: Bound to transcortin in the blood
- Interconversion: Conversion of active cortisol into inactive cortisone through oxidation at position 11
    - Process
        - 11Î²-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase 2 (11Î²-HSD2) catalyzes the reaction of cortisol to cortisone.
        - 11Î²-Hydroxysteroid-Dehydrogenase 1 (11Î²-HSD1) catalyzes the reaction from cortisone to cortisol.
- Deconstruction
    - In the liver: Hydration at the ring and reduction of the keto groups â†’ formation of glucuronide or sulfate esters
- Regulation of synthesis
    - Stimulation: ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland
    - Negative feedback: High cortisol concentrations inhibit the secretion of CRH and ACTH.
    - Circadian Rhythm: High morning CRH concentrations lead to high cortisol levels in the morning.

> [!NOTE]
> The regulation of the synthesis and secretion of glucocorticoids is subject to the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback loop. Through negative feedback, cortisol inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which leads to a reduced release of cortisol!

> [!NOTE] Hypocortisolism (Addison's disease)
> In Addison's disease, there is an insufficiency of all three zones of the adrenal cortex (e.g., due to an autoimmune disease), meaning that the cortical hormones cannot be produced adequately. A deficiency of cortisol can lead to low blood pressure/blood sugar levels, among other things. Nonspecific symptoms such as decreased performance are also possible. In addition, the negative feedback from cortisol is lost, leading to an increased release of ACTH. This is cleaved from pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), while other cleavage products such as MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) are produced simultaneously. Since MSH stimulates the melanocytes in the skin to produce melanin, individuals with hypocortisolism may become noticeable due to a bronze pigmentation of the skin. An acute onset or acute worsening of the condition (e.g., during infections) is referred to as an "Addisonian crisis" and can be life-threatening.

> [!NOTE] Adrenogenital Syndrome
> The adrenogenital syndrome encompasses a group of various congenital metabolic disorders that share different defects in cortisol biosynthesis. In most cases, the 21-hydroxylase is affected. The resulting cortisol deficiency leads to an increased release of ACTH, which in turn leads to the increased synthesis of precursors such as 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone. From these precursors, androgens are subsequently produced in greater amounts. Affected girls may present at birth with clitoral hypertrophy, while boys may exhibit an enlarged penis. If the metabolic disorder also affects aldosterone synthesis, a life-threatening crisis often develops shortly after birth, characterized by hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis, which can lead to dehydration and vomiting.

> [!NOTE] Licorice abuse
> The glycyrrhizic acid contained in licorice inhibits 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. Therefore, consuming licorice in large amounts can lead to less cortisol being converted into the inactive cortisone, allowing cortisol to increasingly exert its mineralocorticoid effects: Increased sodium and water reabsorption raise arterial blood pressure and result in hypokalemia.

### Effects of Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids act on numerous organs and organ systems. Here, an overview of their effects on energy metabolism and the immune system will be provided. For details on other effects, particularly those that occur as side effects during drug substitution, see also: Side effects of glucocorticoid therapy.

#### Molecular Mechanism of Action

Like all steroid hormones, cortisol acts through intracellular receptors â€“ here, two receptors are distinguished. The complex of hormone and receptor enters the cell nucleus and influences gene expression as a transcription factor.

- Type-1 receptor
    - High affinity for cortisol and aldosterone
    - Identical to the mineralocorticoid receptor
    - To reduce the competition between cortisol and aldosterone at the renal mineralocorticoid receptors in favor of aldosterone, 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 converts cortisol into the inactive cortisone.
- Type-2 receptor
    - Binds only cortisol (the name is "glucocorticoid receptor")

> [!NOTE]
> Since glucocorticoids can also bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, one speaks of an additional so-called "mineralocorticoid" effect; that is, they increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, just like aldosterone!

#### Effects of glucocorticoids on metabolism

Cortisol helps the body to mobilize energy reserves in a stressful situation or during food deprivation. It specifically serves to increase blood sugar concentration by inducing the following enzymes:

> [!NOTE]
> Cortisol acts as an insulin antagonist on metabolism!

> [!NOTE] Hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome)
> In the so-called Cushing syndrome, there are significantly elevated cortisol concentrations in the blood. The cause is often excessive therapy with glucocorticoids (exogenous Cushing syndrome) or (less frequently) ACTH-producing tumors, e.g., of the pituitary gland (so-called Cushing's disease). The physiological effects of cortisol are amplified many times over in the context of Cushing syndrome. For instance, the concentration of energy carriers such as glucose in the blood rises sharply due to the breakdown of lipids in peripheral adipose tissue. Due to an unequal receptor distribution in peripheral and central adipose tissue, the effects are different there. The peripheral adipose tissue is broken down, whereas the central (truncal) adipose tissue is built up. A typical redistribution of fat occurs in the affected individuals, resulting in a trunk-dominant obesity and a moon facies while the extremities remain thin. The blood sugar level is permanently elevated; hence, it is also referred to as so-called steroid diabetes.

#### Hematological Effects of Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoids have an immunosuppressive effect, meaning they inhibit the body's immune response. Therefore, they are also used pharmacologically in numerous diseases of the immune system.

- Immunosuppressive effect
    - Inhibition of cytokine formation and release, e.g., from
        - TNF-Î±
        - Interleukin
    - Reduction of T and B cell response, e.g. via
        - Inhibition of the activation and proliferation of B and T lymphocytes
        - Promotion of apoptosis in B and T lymphocytes
- Further hematological effects
    - Lymphocytopenia, Eosinopenia, and Monocytopenia
    - Erythrocytesâ†‘, Plateletsâ†‘ â†’ Increased thrombosis risk
    - Neutrophil granulocytesâ†‘, with eosinophilsâ†“, basophilsâ†“, and lymphocytesâ†“ â†’ This results in overall leukocytosis with a relatively leading proportion of neutrophils

> [!NOTE] Glucocorticoids in Clinical Practice
> Glucocorticoids play an immense role in the drug therapy of numerous diseases associated with the immune system. As an acute medication, they are used, among other things, for excessive immune reactions such as severe allergic reactions. In so-called autoimmune diseases, the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own structures, as in the case of multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease of the nervous system. Here too, glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice during an acute flare-up.

#### Other important glucocorticoid effects

In addition to their effects on metabolism and the immune system, glucocorticoids also have an impact on numerous organs and systems of the body. They become clinically relevant primarily during long-term medication therapy with glucocorticoids. Therefore, their use in practice should always be conducted with care.

Moreover, glucocorticoids increase the sensitivity of adrenergic receptors to catecholamines (so-called permissive effect) and induce their synthesis.

## Androgen

- Definition: Male sex hormones
- Function: Involved in sex determination, reproduction, and the regulation of metabolic processes.
- Occurrence: In all genders
- Production locations
    - In particular, in the gonads
    - In small amounts in the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex
- Synthesis
    - Starting substance: Cholesterol
    - Process
        - Formation of inactive hormone precursors in the adrenal cortex
        - Conversion to estrogen and testosterone in peripheral tissues
## Hormone of the adrenal medulla: Catecholamines

Catecholamines include adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine. While dopamine and noradrenaline primarily act as neurotransmitters and are produced in the respective neurons, adrenaline is a hormone. Adrenaline and noradrenaline are released more during physical and psychological stress situations, such as heavy physical labor or oral examinations. Among other things, they help maintain circulation by increasing blood pressure and heart rate. For this reason, they are often used as medications in intensive and emergency medicine for circulatory instability.

### Catecholamine Synthesis

- Starting material: Phenylalanine
- Key enzyme: Tyrosine hydroxylase
- Synthesis types
    - Various centers of the CNS
    - Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla
    - Postganglionic noradrenergic neurons

#### Synthesis Steps

The formation of catecholamines occurs from the amino acids phenylalanine or tyrosine in several steps.

### Catecholamine Metabolism

- Secretion mechanism: Exocytosis
- Transport: Freely soluble in blood
- Half-life: 1â€“3 minutes
- Stimulation through
    - Activation of the sympathetic nervous system ("fight or flight") â†’ Stimulation of the adrenal medulla via cholinergic synapses â†’ Induction of tyrosine and dopamine hydroxylase
    - Cortisol from the adjacent adrenal cortex â†’ Induction of N-methyltransferase and tyrosine hydroxylase
- Reduction by: Adrenaline and Noradrenaline

> [!NOTE]
> Adrenaline ensures the rapid provision of energy reserves and generally has the shortest plasma half-life in the group of catecholamines!

> [!NOTE]
> In stressful situations, there is an increased production of catecholamines and glucocorticoids. Since glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) stimulate catecholamine synthesis, they thus serve to replenish catecholamine stores!

### Effect

The catecholamines act through G-protein-coupled receptors, known as "adrenergic receptors." There are various subtypes that occur in different organs, vessels, and tissues in varying degrees and differ in their effect profile. In stressful situations, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which in turn stimulates the synthesis of adrenaline in the adrenal medulla. The hydrophilic catecholamines diffuse to the membrane-bound receptors. For the precise functioning of the individual adrenergic receptor types, see: Signal transduction of adrenergic receptors.

> [!NOTE]
> To understand the effect of catecholamines, one must also know the localization of the adrenergic receptors in addition to their effects. For example, catecholamines cause constriction of the blood vessels in the skin and gastrointestinal tract through the activation of Î±1 receptors, while in coronary vessels and skeletal muscle, vasodilation occurs via the activation of Î²2 receptors. This centralizes blood flow, meaning that primarily the body's core and vital organs such as the heart, lungs, and brain are supplied!

> [!NOTE]
> QISSS ("KISS"): The Î±1 receptor is coupled with Gq protein, the Î±2 receptor with Gi protein, and the Î²1, Î²2, and Î²3 receptors with Gs protein.

### Reduction

The noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerve endings is mostly reabsorbed into the axon (reuptake mechanism). The hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline circulating in the blood are broken down by COMT and MAO into vanillylmandelic acid. Here is an overview of adrenaline breakdown; the breakdown of noradrenaline occurs similarly.

> The common breakdown product of adrenaline and noradrenaline is vanillylmandelic acid; it is excreted in the urine!

> [!NOTE]
> The catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline are methylated by COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) and oxidized by MAO (monoamine oxidase)!

> [!NOTE]
> COMT SAM to MAO, the catecholamines say goodbye!

> [!NOTE] Pheochromocytoma
> In the case of pheochromocytoma, it is a catecholamine-producing tumor that primarily occurs in the adrenal medulla. The high concentrations of catecholamines lead to the regular effects of catecholamines being significantly amplified. As a result, affected individuals may experience severely elevated blood pressure, headaches, tachycardia, and sweating episodes. The increase in catecholamine concentration in the blood also leads to an increase in the breakdown product vanillylmandelic acid in the urine. This can be diagnostically detected when a pheochromocytoma is suspected.



> [!NOTE] COMT and MAO inhibitors as Parkinson's medications and antidepressants
> Just like adrenaline and noradrenaline, dopamine and its precursor Dopa are broken down by COMT and MAO. This is utilized, among other things, in the therapy of Parkinson's syndrome, which is characterized by a deficiency of dopamine. When the breakdown of Dopa is inhibited by COMT or MAO inhibitors, the effects of dopamine are enhanced.

> [!NOTE]
> One of the various theories regarding the onset of depression sees a deficiency of neurotransmitters in the brain as the cause of the condition. To increase the concentration of these neurotransmitters, their breakdown via MAO and COMT can be inhibited pharmacologically. These so-called MAO or COMT inhibitors can have a mood-enhancing effect.

### Development of the Adrenal Glands and Paraganglia

The different functions of the adrenal cortex and medulla stem from their different embryonic origins. While the cortex originates from the mesoderm, the medulla develops from the ectoderm like other derivatives of the neural crest.

### Adrenal Cortex

- Starting point: Mesothelium (Mesoderm)
- Beginning of development: 4th embryonic week
- Development
    - Proliferation of paraaortal zÃ¶lomepithelium
    - Migration of zonular epithelial cells into the underlying mesenchyme
    - Differentiation to adrenal cortex cells
    - Prenatal
        - Formation of the fetal zone: Located prenatally within the cortex and assumes its function.
    - Postnatal
        - Development of the three zones of the adrenal cortex and regression of the fetal zone

### Adrenal Medulla

- Starting point: Neural crest (Ectoderm)
- Development
    - After differentiation of the adrenal cortex: Infiltration of sympathoblasts into the developing cortical structure
    - Differentiation from chromaffin cells with the ability to produce catecholamines
## Review Questions on the Chapter Adrenal Gland
### Macroscopic Anatomy

What are the peritoneal relations of the adrenal glands?  
- The adrenal glands are primarily located retroperitoneally.  
Which anatomical space lies ventral to the left adrenal gland?  
- Ventral to the left adrenal gland lies the omental bursa, which separates it from the posterior wall of the stomach.  
How is the adrenal gland supplied with blood?  
- The adrenal gland is usually supplied by three arteries: the superior suprarenal artery (from the phrenic artery), the middle suprarenal artery (from the abdominal aorta), and the inferior suprarenal artery (from the renal artery).  
### Microscopic Anatomy

What are the zones of the adrenal cortex and what hormones are produced there?  
- The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: in the outer zona glomerulosa mineralocorticoids are produced, in the middle zona fasciculata glucocorticoids, and in the innermost zona reticularis androgens.  
What histologically characterizes the cells of the adrenal cortex? Describe the typical cell arrangement in each of the zones!  
- The epithelial cells of the adrenal cortex exhibit typical histological features of steroid hormone-producing cells. They contain numerous lipid droplets, where cholesterol esters are stored as precursors for steroid biosynthesis. They also have mitochondria of the tubular type and a pronounced smooth ER. The arrangement of cells differs in the three zones of the adrenal cortex and gives each its name: glomerulosa (tuft-like), fasciculata (cord-like), and reticularis (network-like).  
What histological features characterize the tissue of the adrenal medulla?  
- The cells of the adrenal medulla are histologically recognized as large chromaffin cells with many secretory granules (for catecholamine storage). In addition, venous valves are typical in the adrenal medulla.  
To which cell type can the cells of the adrenal medulla be assigned?  
- The cells of the adrenal medulla are modified second sympathetic neurons, innervated by cholinergic synapses.  
### Hormones of the Adrenal Cortex

What is the common basic reaction of steroid hormone synthesis, which enzyme catalyzes it, and what principle does it operate on?  
- The common basic reaction of steroid hormone synthesis is the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. The key enzyme cholesterol desmolase cleaves the side chain oxidatively between carbon atoms 20 and 22, removing carbon atoms 22 to 27 (a total of 6 carbon atoms).  
Name the most important intermediates of aldosterone biosynthesis!  
- The intermediates of aldosterone biosynthesis are: pregnenolone â†’ progesterone â†’ 11-deoxycorticosterone â†’ aldosterone.  
Name the most important stimulators and inhibitors of aldosterone secretion!  
- Aldosterone secretion is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aldosterone release is stimulated by angiotensin II. Another important stimulator is a high potassium concentration in the blood. The most important inhibitor is atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).  
Summarize briefly the molecular mechanism of action and effects of aldosterone!  
- Aldosterone stimulates sodium and water reabsorption as well as potassium excretion in the distal tubule, connecting tubule, and collecting duct of the kidney. This occurs via binding to the cytosolic mineralocorticoid receptor, which acts as a transcription factor upon aldosterone binding and mediates the incorporation of certain transporters into the membranes of these nephron segments: the Na+/K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), potassium channels (ROMK), and an H+-ATPase in the luminal membrane.  
What symptoms are typically associated with primary hyper- or hypoaldosteronism?  
- In primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), stimulation of sodium and water reabsorption leads to increased intravascular volume and elevated blood pressure. Conn's syndrome is the most common endocrine cause of secondary arterial hypertension. The increased potassium secretion causes hypokalemia. In primary hypoaldosteronism, conversely, hyperkalemia, reduced intravascular volume (hypotonic dehydration), and low blood pressure occur.  
Which is the most significant glucocorticoid in the human body? Describe its chemical structure!  
- The most significant glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol. It is a steroid hormone with 21 carbon atoms.  
Describe the principle of cortisol biosynthesis! What important cofactor is required for several reactions?  
- The starting material for cortisol biosynthesis is cholesterol. It is first converted into pregnenolone, which is metabolized via two different pathways: one via the intermediate progesterone, the other via 17Î±-hydroxypregnenolone. Both pathways generate the product 17Î±-hydroxyprogesterone, which is further converted into cortisol through subsequent steps. The most important cofactor is vitamin C.  
Name the key enzyme of cortisol biosynthesis and describe the reaction it catalyzes! What disease is most often caused by a defect in this enzyme?  
- The key enzyme of cortisol biosynthesis is 21-hydroxylase. It catalyzes the vitamin C-dependent hydroxylation of 17Î±-progesterone to 11-deoxycortisol. About 90% of patients with adrenogenital syndrome have a defect in 21-hydroxylase.  
What is meant by interconversion in relation to cortisol metabolism and how does it occur?  
- Interconversion means the conversion of active cortisol into inactive cortisone (by 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2) and the conversion of inactive cortisone into active cortisol (by 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1).  
How is cortisol biosynthesis regulated?  
- The synthesis and secretion of glucocorticoids are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary feedback loop. Cortisol synthesis and release are stimulated by ACTH from the anterior pituitary. Through negative feedback, cortisol inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH from the hypothalamus and pituitary, resulting in reduced cortisol secretion.  
How and where is cortisol broken down?  
- Cortisol is inactivated in the liver by hydrogenation of the A-ring and reduction of the 3-ketogroup. It is subsequently esterified and excreted via bile and kidneys.  
Why does hyperpigmentation of the skin occur in adrenal cortex insufficiency?  
- In adrenal cortex insufficiency (Addison's disease), the low serum cortisol level leads to loss of negative feedback, causing increased ACTH production. This results in enhanced synthesis of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the pituitary. POMC is not only a precursor of ACTH but also of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). Both are therefore synthesized in increased amounts. The increased presence of MSH (and also ACTH) stimulates melanocytes to increased pigment deposition. Unlike sunlight-induced skin pigmentation, areas not usually exposed to direct light (e.g., palms and skin folds) also darken.  
Through which mechanism does licorice abuse lead to hypokalemia?  
- Glycyrrhizic acid contained in licorice inhibits the interconversion of cortisol into inactive cortisone. In licorice abuse, the concentration of active cortisol is elevated, making its otherwise weak mineralocorticoid effect clinically apparent. By stimulating renal mineralocorticoid receptors, sodium and water reabsorption increases (raising arterial blood pressure), and potassium is excreted more strongly (hypokalemia).  
What effect does cortisol have on glucose metabolism? Which enzymes does it induce?  
- Cortisol increases blood glucose concentration by stimulating enzymes of gluconeogenesis, such as pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphatase. Additionally, glycogen synthesis is stimulated to ensure glucose supply even during starvation periods.  
Describe the typical appearance of a person with long-lasting hypercortisolism (so-called Cushing's syndrome)!  
- Hypercortisolism causes redistribution of fat tissue from peripheral to central areas. Affected persons typically have a rounded face ("moon face") and central obesity with slender extremities.  
Describe the effect of cortisol on the immune system and bone metabolism!  
- Cortisol acts immunosuppressively by inhibiting cytokine production and release and reducing B- and T-cell responses. It also causes lymphocytopenia, eosinopenia, and monocytopenia, but simultaneously neutrophilic granulocytosis. In bone metabolism, it inhibits osteoblasts (causing bone atrophy) and reduces apoptosis of osteoclasts (leading to bone resorption).  
### Hormones of the adrenal medulla: Catecholamines

Name the intermediates and the key enzyme of catecholamine biosynthesis!  
- The intermediates of catecholamine synthesis are phenylalanine â†’ tyrosine â†’ dopa â†’ dopamine â†’ noradrenaline â†’ adrenaline. The key enzyme is tyrosine hydroxylase.  
Name the four cofactors of catecholamine synthesis!  
- The cofactors of catecholamine synthesis are tetrahydrobiopterin, pyridoxal phosphate, vitamin C, and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).  
Which of the intermediate steps in catecholamine synthesis involve hydroxylations?  
- Three reactions in catecholamine synthesis are hydroxylations: the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, tyrosine to dopa, and dopamine to noradrenaline.  
What is the chemical process involved in the conversion of Dopa to dopamine?  
- The conversion of dopa to dopamine is a decarboxylation.  
Which enzyme catalyzes the conversion of noradrenaline to adrenaline and what cofactor does it require?  
- The conversion of noradrenaline to adrenaline is catalyzed by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, with S-adenosylmethionine as a cofactor.  
In what situations and through which mechanisms is the synthesis and release of catecholamines stimulated?  
- The synthesis and release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla are stimulated in physical and psychological stress situations (e.g., exams) via sympathetic activation and cortisol from the neighboring adrenal cortex. Both pathways induce certain enzymes.  
Which catecholamine has the shortest half-life and therefore particularly ensures the rapid availability of energy reserves?  
- Among catecholamines, adrenaline has the shortest half-life and therefore particularly ensures rapid availability of energy reserves.  
What effect do Î±1-adrenoceptors convey?  
- Î±1-Adrenoceptors mediate contraction of the smooth muscle in blood vessels of the skin and GI tract, resulting in vasoconstriction. This mobilizes or redistributes blood in favor of the muscles.  
Which effector molecule/second messenger do the Î²-adrenergic receptors act on?  
- Î²-Adrenoceptors stimulate adenylate cyclase, which then synthesizes the second messenger cAMP.  
How are adrenaline and noradrenaline broken down? What is the end product of the breakdown?  
- Adrenaline and noradrenaline are first methylated by COMT (cofactor SAM) and then oxidatively deaminated by MAO. The end product of the breakdown is vanillylmandelic acid.
