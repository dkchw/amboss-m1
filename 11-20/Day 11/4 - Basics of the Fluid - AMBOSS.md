# Basics of the Fluid
## Summary

The circulatory system enables the transport of blood throughout the body. Functionally, it can be divided into a high-pressure system (primarily arteries) and a low-pressure system (primarily veins); anatomically, it can be subdivided into a large systemic circulation and a small pulmonary circulation. The high-pressure system generates the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, among other things, through the windkessel function of the heart-adjacent vessels. Both the blood flow and the propagation of the pressure wave generated by the heart can be described using pulse waves (flow pulse and pressure pulse). In the low-pressure system, there is a significantly reduced blood pressure, which is referred to as central venous pressure (CVP) in the area of the right atrium. The rhythmic changes in CVP, for example, caused by the heart's action, are described as venous pulse. Since the low-pressure system does not have its own motor (in the high-pressure system, the heart is the driving motor), various auxiliary structures such as venous valves ensure the directed return flow to the heart. The blood pressures of the high- and low-pressure systems are also influenced by gravity and thus the posture of the person. The area of the body where the blood pressures remain constant in lying and standing positions is called the hydrostatic indifference point. When transitioning from lying to standing, the blood pressures above this point decrease, while those below it increase.

To describe the forces present in the circulation more precisely, many physical laws can be applied to the circulation under certain simplifying assumptions. Based on physical laws such as Ohm's Law, Kirchhoff's Laws, and the Hagen-Poiseuille Law, both the volumetric flow rate, pressure difference, and resistance of individual vessels as well as entire sections of the circulation can be determined. Whether the blood flows in uniform layers (laminar) or completely disordered (turbulent) depends significantly on the flow velocity. The transition from laminar to turbulent flow is described by the so-called Reynolds number.

## Anatomical and Functional Structure of the Circulatory System

### Anatomical Structure of the Circulatory Systems

The human circulatory system can be anatomically divided into two interconnected circulatory systems: the systemic circulation (body circulation) and the pulmonary circulation (lung circulation).

1. Large circulation / systemic circulation
    - Direction of blood flow: Left ventricle → Aorta → Organ arteries → Organs (capillary bed) → Organ veins → Superior/inferior vena cava → Right atrium
    - Functions
        - Supply of the body and organs with oxygen and nutrients
        - Transport of gases (e.g., CO2) and metabolic metabolites
    - Special case: Portal vein systems
        - Definition: Vascular system in which two capillary beds follow one another
        - Examples
            - Intestine/Liver (Hepatic portal vein)
            - Hypothalamus/Pituitary (V. hypophyseal portal)
2. Pulmonary Circulation / Lung Circulation
    - Direction of blood flow: Right atrium → Right ventricle → Pulmonary artery → Lung (capillary bed) → Pulmonary veins → Left atrium
    - Function: Transport of "used" venous blood to the lungs (for gas exchange there)

> [!NOTE]
> Portal venous systems are an exception in blood flow, as two capillary beds are traversed in succession!

> [!NOTE]
> The general definition that arteries always carry oxygen-rich blood and veins always carry oxygen-poor blood cannot be applied in the pulmonary circulation. There, the pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor blood and the pulmonary veins carry oxygen-rich blood!

### Functional Structure of the Circulatory System

The pressure in the human circulatory system varies in different sections of the circulation. Based on the prevailing pressure, a functional distinction can be made between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system.

## Physical Principles: Current and Resistance in the Circulatory System

Laws of fluid dynamics are often used to describe the regularities of the human circulatory system. They primarily serve to understand fundamental relationships, as most laws of fluid dynamics cannot be strictly applied to the human circulatory system and blood. They generally apply only to rigid pipes and ideal Newtonian fluids. Both of these do not apply to the human body with its elastic vessels and inhomogeneous blood.

### Basic Quantities: Current and Resistance

- Volumetric flow rate
    - Definition: Volume that flows through a system per unit of time
    - Formula: Q = ΔV / Δt
        - Q = Volumetric flow rate; ΔV = Volume difference; Δt = Time difference
    - Unit: L/min (Liters per Minute)
    - Special feature: The volumetric flow rate is the same everywhere in a system of communicating tubes (e.g., in the human circulatory system) (continuity law, see below)
    - Example: The cardiac output corresponds to the total volumetric flow rate of the human body.
- Vascular resistance
    - Definition: Forces that the heart must overcome in order for a vessel or section of the circulatory system to be filled with blood.
    - Formula symbol: R
    - Unit: (mmHg × min) / L

### Ohm's Law in Circuits

The Ohm's Law actually represents the relationships between voltage, resistance, and current in electricity. However, with the basic considerations explained below, it can also be applied to flowing liquids. In this case, there is a relationship between pressure difference, resistance, and volumetric flow rate.

- Adapted Ohm's Law: ΔP = R × Q'
    - Units: ΔP = pressure difference [mmHg]; R = flow resistance [(mmHg×min)/L]; Q' = [volumetric flow rate [L/min]
- Application example: Total peripheral resistance (TPR)
    - Definition: The total peripheral resistance describes the sum of all vascular resistances in the systemic circulation.
    - Basic considerations
        - The pressure difference (ΔP) of the systemic circulation corresponds to the difference between the arterial mean pressure (PA) and the central venous pressure (CVP)
        - The volumetric flow rate of the systemic circulation is the cardiac output (CO)
    - Calculation example
        - Given: Arterial mean pressure (PA ≈ 100 mmHg), central venous pressure (CVP ≈ 5 mmHg), cardiac output (CO ≈ 5 L/min)
        - Sought: Total peripheral resistance
        - Calculation instructions
            - R = ΔP / Q' → TPR = (PA − PZVD) / HZV
            - TPR = (100 mmHg − 5 mmHg) / 5 L/min ≈ 19 mmHg×min/L
- Derivation of the adapted Ohm's law
    - Ohm's Law: U = R × I (U = Voltage [V], R = Resistance [Ω], I = [Current [A])
    - Considerations on the application of Ohm's Law to blood flow
        - Electric voltage (U) represents an electrical potential difference.
            - Analogy in the circulation: Electrical potential difference is here a difference (Δ) of the (blood) pressure (P) between the starting and ending point of the circulation → U becomes ΔP
        - Electrical resistance (R) can be analogously used as flow resistance (R) in blood flow → R remains R
        - Electric current (I) indicates how much electric charge passes through a cross-sectional area (per unit of time)
            - Analogy in the circuit: Electric current strength here is the amount of volume (V) that flows through the vessel per unit of time (/min) → I becomes Q'
- Standard values of resistances
    - Body circulation (= TPR): Approx. 11–20 mmHg × min/L
    - Pulmonary circulation: Approx. 0.5–1 mmHg × min/L

#### Bayliss Effect

Various organs (e.g., the brain and the kidney) are capable of maintaining their blood flow through muscular regulation of vessel diameter, even when the arterial blood pressure changes. This is referred to as the so-called Bayliss effect and can be derived from Ohm's law: When blood pressure increases (ΔP↑), resistance (R) must be increased to keep the volumetric flow rate (Q') constant. This is primarily achieved through the contraction of smooth vascular muscle, which leads to a narrowing of the lumen and thus to the desired increase in resistance. This strong dependence of resistance on (vessel) radius is explained using the Hagen-Poiseuille law.

### Continuity Law

The continuity law states that the volumetric flow rate of a fluid in a system of communicating pipes is the same in all areas. Since the volumetric flow rate is the product of the cross-sectional area and the flow velocity, these must behave oppositely in order for the volumetric flow rate to remain constant.

- Continuity equation: Q' = A × vm
    - For several communicating vessels, the following applies: Q = A1 × v1 = A2 × v2 = ... = An × vn
    - Units: Q' = flow rate [L/min]; A = vessel cross-section [cm2]; vm = mean flow velocity [cm/s]
- Derivation/Fundamental Considerations
    - The volumetric flow rate must remain constant in all sections of a system of communicating tubes.
    - This statement can be applied to the circulatory system with its vessels (≈ communicating tubes).
- Conclusions
    - Since the flow rate is constant in all areas, the flow velocity and the vessel cross-section behave oppositely to each other.
        - In large vessel cross-sections, blood flows slowly (e.g., in the capillary bed)
        - In small vessel cross-sections, blood flows quickly (e.g., in the area of a stenosis)
- 1. Calculation example (ascending aorta)
    - Given: Vessel cross-section (A ≈ 3 cm2) and volumetric flow rate of the ascending aorta (Q' = CO ≈ 5 L/min)
    - Sought: Average flow velocity (v) of the ascending aorta
    - Calculation instructions
        - Q' = A × v
        - v = Q' / A
        - v = 5 L/min / 3 cm2
        - v = 5/3 L/ cm2 × min → v = 5/3 × 1.000 cm3 / cm2 × min
        - v = 5/3 x 103 cm/min → v = 5/3 x 103 cm/60 s
        - v ≈ 28 cm/s
- 2. Calculation example (capillaries)
    - Given: Cross-sectional area of all capillaries (A ≈ 3,000 cm2) and total volumetric flow rate of the body (= CO ≈ 5 L/min)
    - Sought: Flow velocity (v)
    - Calculation instructions
        - Q' = A × v
        - v = Q' / A
        - v = 5 L/min / 3.000 cm2
        - v = 5/3.000 L/cm2× min → v = 5/3.000 × 1.000 cm3/cm2 × min → v = 5/3 cm/min → v = 5/3 x cm/60 s
        - v ≈ 0.028 cm/s = 28 x 10^-3 cm/s

### Kirchhoff's Laws and the Resistances of Circuit Sections

The total resistance of flowing systems can be calculated based on Kirchhoff's laws of electricity. The total resistance of vessels through which current flows sequentially is the sum of the individual resistances. The reciprocal of the total resistance of vessels through which current flows in parallel is calculated from the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.

#### Basic considerations

- Kirchhoff's laws (junction rule and mesh rule) of electrical theory state something about the total resistance of parallel or series-connected individual resistors.
- Can also be used for flowing liquids (e.g., blood in circulation)

#### Sequentially flowed vessels (resistances)

- 1. Kirchhoff's Law: Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + Rn
- Conclusions
    - The total resistance of a section of a vessel is obtained from the sum of the individual resistances overcome in succession (in series).
    - The resistance of a circuit section increases with the number or length of the sequentially traversed "individual vessels."
- Calculation example
    - Given: Flow system with two consecutively flowing resistances R1 (= 20 mmHg×min/L) and R2 (= 5 mmHg×min/L)
    - Sought: Total resistance of the flowing system
    - Calculation instructions
        - Rtotal = R1 + R2
        - Rtotal = (20 mmHg×min/L) + (5 mmHg×min/L) = 25 mmHg×min/L

#### Vessels with parallel flow (Resistances)

- 2. Kirchhoff's Law: 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + … + 1/Rn
- Conclusions
    - The reciprocal of the total resistance is determined by the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances.
    - The total resistance of parallel-connected vessels is always smaller than any individual resistance of a flowing vessel.
    - The total resistance is smaller the more vessels are flowed through in parallel.
- Calculation example
    - Given: A flow system with two parallel (simultaneously) traversed resistances R1 (= 20 mmHg×min/L) and R2 (= 5 mmHg×min/L)
    - Sought: Total resistance of the flowing system
    - Calculation instructions
        - 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2
        - 1/Rtotal = 1/(20 mmHg×min/L) + 1/(5 mmHg×min/L) = 1/20 (mmHg×min/L) + 4/20 (mmHg×min/L)
        - 1/Rtotal = 5/20 (mmHg×min/L) = 1/4 (mmHg×min/L)
        - Rtotal = 4 mmHg×min/L

> [!NOTE]
> The transition of an arteriole or metarteriole into a capillary bed is a clear example of Kirchhoff's laws. By branching a vessel into many parallel-flowing vessels, the resistance in the capillary bed decreases significantly!

### Hagen-Poiseuille Law and Vascular Resistance

The Hagen-Poiseuille law actually describes the volumetric flow rate of a laminar flowing Newtonian fluid in a pipe with radius r. During the flow through a pipe, the volumetric flow rate is most strongly dependent on the pipe radius (r4). According to Ohm's law, the volumetric flow rate results from the quotient of the pressure difference (ΔP) and the vessel resistance (R). Therefore, from the combination of Ohm's law and the Hagen-Poiseuille law, it becomes clear that not only the volumetric flow rate but also the vessel resistance is mainly influenced by the vessel radius (r4).

- Basic considerations
    - Applies strictly only to laminar flowing Newtonian fluids in a pipe → Simplifying assumption necessary for application to the circulation
    - Does it actually serve to calculate the volumetric flow rate (this is most strongly dependent on the pipe radius!)
    - If you apply Ohm's law to the Hagen-Poiseuille law, statements can be made about the resistance of a vessel.
- Derivation
    1. Ohm's law applied to the circuit: ΔP = R × Q' → Q' = ΔP / R
    2. Hagen-Poiseuille Law: Q' = [(π × r4) / (8 × η × l)] × ΔP
        - Units: (Q' = volumetric flow rate [L/min]; r = radius [cm]; η = dynamic viscosity [Pa×s], l = vessel length [cm], ΔP = pressure difference [mmHg])
    3. "Equating the flow volumes": Q' = [(π × r4) / (8 × η × l)] × ΔP = ΔP / R
    4. Transformation according to the resistance R: R = (8 × η × l) / (π × r4)
- Adapted Hagen-Poiseuille Law: R = (8 × η × l) / (π × r4)
- Conclusions
    - Volume flow rate is directly proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius.
    - Flow resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel radius
    - Small changes in vessel radius (e.g. due to atherosclerotic plaques) significantly increase flow resistance (and effective blood flow)!
- Calculation example: Halving the vessel radius (R ∼ 1/ 0.54 = 1/ 0.0625 = 16) → Vascular resistance R increases by a factor of 16!

> [!NOTE]
> The main statement of the Hagen-Poiseuille law is: Small changes in vessel radius lead to extreme changes in flow resistance (R ∼ 1/r4)!

> [!NOTE] Vessel stenosis
> In the case of a vascular stenosis, it refers to a pathological narrowing of a blood vessel. The causes for this can be, for example, arteriosclerosis, thromboses, or tumors. A stenosis reduces the blood pressure in the sections of the blood vessel downstream from it, while immediately before the stenosis, the pressure is disproportionately high due to the narrowing of the vessel's lumen. Patients with a stenosis in the course of the supply area of an arm thus show differences in blood pressure values between both arms during upper arm blood pressure measurement. A difference of more than 20 mmHg is considered conclusive evidence of a stenosis. Thus, in the case of a right-sided stenosis between the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and the measurement point on the right arm, a significantly lower blood pressure is observed compared to the left arm of the patient.

> [!NOTE]
> Blood flow distal to a stenosis can be maintained up to a certain degree of stenosis through various mechanisms. These include, among others, the formation of collateral vessels and the dilation of vessels distal to a stenosis.

## Physical Principles: Blood Flow

In flowing liquids such as blood, a distinction is made between ordered (laminar) and turbulent flow. Turbulent flows occur in the human body only in the area of the outlets of the large heart-adjacent vessels (e.g., the aortic arch) at high flow velocities.

### Laminar and Turbulent Flows

- Laminar flow
    - Definition: The fluid flows in ordered overlapping layers without creating any turbulence.
    - Flow direction: Only parallel to the vessel
    - Generated friction: Low
    - Special flow properties
        - The central blood layer (so-called axial flow) flows the fastest.
        - The maximum flow velocity decreases towards the outer (wall-adjacent) layers → a parabolic flow profile results.
- Turbulent Flow
    - Definition: The blood components are stirred during flow, resulting in a disordered blood flow.
    - Flow direction: Unidirectional towards the vessel
    - Generated friction: Significantly increased
    - Special flow properties
        - The maximum flow velocity is nearly uniform across the entire vessel cross-section, as the vortices (= turbulences) significantly contribute to the flow resistance.
            - Due to additional friction against the vessel wall, the flow velocity is slightly lower right there.
        - Turbulent flows move slower than laminar flows (with the same pressure difference)
- Reynolds number (Re)
    - Definition: The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that can be used to estimate whether a fluid flows laminar or turbulent under certain conditions.
    - Calculation of the Reynolds number: Re = (2 × r × ρ × v) / η
        - Units: r = Radius [cm], ρ = [Density kg×m−3], v = [Velocity [m/s], η = Dynamic Viscosity [Pa×s]
    - Conclusions: Transition from laminar to turbulent flow at a Reynolds number >2000–2200

> [!NOTE]
> Aside from a few heart-adjacent vessels during the ejection phase, laminar flow predominates in all vessels of the body physiologically. However, with increasing flow velocity, any laminar flow can fundamentally transition into a turbulent flow – in some cases, this is even audible in the form of flow noises (e.g., during blood pressure measurement according to Riva Rocci)!

> [!NOTE] Blood pressure measurement according to Riva-Rocci
> The human blood pressure is an important diagnostic parameter that can be determined in clinical practice through indirect measurement according to Riva Rocci. This method exploits the fact that turbulent flows lead to the development of sounds. At the beginning, a cuff is placed around the upper arm at heart level, which is inflated using a hand pump to above the patient's systolic blood pressure (>120mmHg). This completely restricts the blood supply and thus the blood flow in the brachial artery. When the stethoscope is placed in the elbow crease, one hears nothing as no blood is flowing. The pressure in the cuff is then slowly released. As soon as it falls below the systolic blood pressure, blood once again flows through the upper arm during systole. However, the brachial artery is still significantly compressed by the cuff, meaning its radius is considerably smaller (than without the cuff). According to the continuity equation, blood flows much faster with a reduced vessel radius, causing the previously laminar blood flow (without the cuff) to transition into a turbulent blood flow. These turbulences produce sounds (known as Korotkow sounds), which can be perceived with the stethoscope in the elbow crease. The pressure in the cuff is now evenly released until the sounds disappear. This physically marks the transition from noisy turbulent blood flow to quiet laminar blood flow. The pressure at which the sounds first appear indicates the systolic blood pressure, and the pressure at which the sounds disappear again indicates the diastolic blood pressure.

### Influencing Factors on Blood Viscosity

The viscosity is a measure of the internal friction of a liquid. In non-Newtonian liquids like blood, viscosity depends not only on temperature but also on various other factors such as hematocrit, flow velocity, or vessel size. Therefore, the prevailing viscosity is referred to as the so-called apparent viscosity. The Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect and reversible aggregation are flow phenomena of microcirculation that alter the apparent viscosity in opposite ways.

1. Hematocrit
2. Vessel radius
    - Fåhraeus-Lindqvist Effect
        - Definition: Reduction of the apparent viscosity due to a central arrangement of erythrocytes in the axial flow of vessels with a small diameter.
        - Condition: Vessel size <300 μm. If the vessel diameter drops below 7–10 μm, the Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect ends, meaning the apparent viscosity increases again.
        - Mechanism
            - Red blood cells align centrally in the axial flow due to the lower shear forces in the center (so-called axial migration)
            - A cell-poor sliding layer forms between the erythrocytes located in the center and the vessel wall.
        - Conclusion: Minimum of the apparent viscosity in vessels with a diameter of 7–10 μm
3. Flow velocity
    - Reversible Aggregation
        - Definition: Increase in apparent viscosity due to the reversible aggregation of erythrocytes at low flow velocities.
        - Condition: Low river velocity
        - Mechanism
            - Erythrocytes aggregate into rouleaux-like structures with the help of plasma proteins (e.g., fibrinogen).
            - Aggregates no longer pass well through small vessels → Increase in apparent viscosity
        - Conclusion: Increase in apparent viscosity, which occurs only at very low flow rates (e.g. in the case of circulatory shock)
4. Temperature
5. Plasma proteins

> [!NOTE]
> The resistance of a vessel according to Hagen-Poiseuille is given by R = (8 × η × l) / (π × r4), which primarily depends on the pipe radius (r4), but is also influenced by the viscosity (η). The Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect reduces the apparent viscosity of blood in small vessels and thus counteracts the influence of the vessel radius!

## Features of the High-Pressure System

In systole, the heart ejects its stroke volume into the vessels of the high-pressure system, thereby generating systolic blood pressure. The elastic vessel walls of the heart-adjacent vessels are stretched in the process. In diastole, these elastic fibers relax again and create diastolic blood pressure through their restorative forces – this is referred to as the windkessel function. The pressure generated by the heart in systole is transmitted through the vessels in the form of a pressure wave, which is described using the pressure pulse curve. The actual movement of the blood is slower than the propagation of the pressure wave, which is why blood flow is described with a separate curve – the flow pulse curve.

### Windkessel Function

- Definition: Temporary storage of a portion of the energy generated by the heart during systole in the elastic fibers of heart-adjacent vessels.
- Function: Conversion of the pulsatile (discontinuous) blood flow from the heart into a steady (continuous) blood flow
- Process
    - Systole
        - Heart ejects stroke volume into the aorta → Increase in blood volume in the ascending aorta (since not all of the stroke volume flows directly into the circulation)
        - Stretching of the elastic fibers of the aorta (due to increased volume)
        - Storage of the energy produced by the heart (as potential energy) in the stretched elastic fibers of the heart-adjacent arteries
    - Diastole
        - Slow and uniform relaxation of the elastic fibers → Blood volume that has stretched the elastic fibers flows into the circulation.
        - Generation of continuous diastolic blood pressure

> [!NOTE]
> Due to the windkessel effect, the diastolic blood pressure in the heart-adjacent vessels (e.g., in the pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta) does not drop below the diastolic ventricular pressure!

> [!NOTE] Atherosclerosis
> In atherosclerotic remodeling processes, the vessel wall hardens. In the area of the aorta, this leads to the aortic wall becoming stiffer and losing elasticity, which negatively affects the windkessel function of the aorta overall: A stiffer aorta results in less energy (in the form of blood volume accelerated by the heart) being stored in the elastic fibers during systole, causing systolic blood pressure to rise. During diastole, correspondingly less stored blood volume can be mobilized from the aorta, resulting in a decrease in diastolic blood pressure. Overall, this increases the blood pressure amplitude.

### Pulse Waves

When the heart pumps its stroke volume into the aorta, it generates two so-called pulse waves. The pressure pulse wave describes the propagation of the pressure generated by the heart, which spreads rapidly through the vascular system. The flow pulse wave, on the other hand, reflects the propagation of the blood volume that is expelled from the heart. The propagation speed of the flow pulse wave thus corresponds to the flow rate of the blood, whereas the pressure spreads significantly faster.

#### Pressure Pulse

- Definition: Pulsatile fluctuations of arterial blood pressure in the vessels of the high-pressure system over time
- Origin: Increase in blood pressure from 80 mmHg to 120 mmHg (in systole)
- Propagation speed: Faster than the flow velocity (about 4–6 m/s)
    - Depending on: Blood pressure, vessel size and elasticity
    - Moens-Korteweg equation: c = √[(h × E')/ (2r × P)]
        - Units: c = pulse wave velocity [cm/s]; h = vessel wall thickness [cm]; E' = volumetric elasticity modulus [g/cm×s²]; r = internal radius [cm]; P = [density of blood in [g/cm³]
        - Conclusions
            - The more rigid and smaller the vessel, the faster the propagation of the pressure wave.
            - Propagation speed in vessels: central < peripheral
        - Example speed: Aorta ∼ 5 m/s → Periphery ∼ 8–12 m/s
- Special Features
    - Closure of the aortic valve leads to the cessation of the central pressure pulse of the aorta.
    - Reflection: The pressure wave generated by the aorta is reflected in the body, for example, at the branching points of the vascular system, meaning it "runs" back to the heart.
        - Elevation of the pressure curve in the periphery
        - Reflection of the reflected pressure wave → Formation of a so-called dicrotic wave

#### Pulse Current

- Definition: Pulsatile fluctuations of blood flow velocity in the vessels of the high-pressure system over time
- Origin: Rhythmic ejection of blood volume into the aorta
- Propagation speed: Corresponds to the flow velocity (on average 0.15–0.2 m/s)
    - Dependent on: Elasticity of the vessel walls, vessel diameter, and flow rate strength (see also continuity equation)
    - Conclusion: The current pulse indicates the temporal course and direction of the flowing blood volume.
- Special Features
    - Negative values of flow velocity in the vessels of the systemic circulation due to short blood reflux to the aortic valve.
    - Decrease in flow velocity in the periphery
    - Biphasic course of the current pulse curve

> [!NOTE]
> If vessel properties (e.g., cross-section or wall thickness) change, pulse waves are reflected at these points of the vascular system. Overlapping pressure pulses add together, while opposing currents subtract from each other. Thus, the pressure pulse increases in the periphery, while the current pulse decreases!

### Arterial Blood Pressure

The pressure generated by the high-pressure system is referred to as arterial blood pressure. It is divided into systolic and diastolic blood pressure and measured in mmHg (force per unit area). The temporal course of arterial blood pressure is described using the pressure pulse curve.

- Composition of arterial blood pressure
    1. Systolic blood pressure
        - Definition: Maximum arterial blood pressure during systole (and highest point of the pressure pulse curve)
        - Normal value: ≤130 mmHg
        - Generation by: Ejection force of the left ventricle
    2. Diastolic blood pressure
        - Definition: Minimal arterial blood pressure during diastole (and lowest point on the pressure pulse curve)
        - Normal value: ≤85 mmHg
        - Generation by: Windkessel function of the aorta (and the heart-adjacent elastic vessels)
- Blood pressure amplitude
    - Definition: Difference between the maximum systolic and the minimum diastolic blood pressure values
    - Course: Becomes larger towards the periphery
- Arterial Mean Pressure
    - Definition: Average pressure in the vessels of the high-pressure system over the time of systole and diastole
    - Course: Decreases towards the periphery
    - Calculation
        - In central arteries: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) = Diastolic pressure + ½ × (systolic pressure – diastolic pressure)
        - In distant arteries: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) = Diastolic pressure + ⅓ × (systolic pressure – diastolic pressure)
- Physiological fluctuations in blood pressure
    - First-order blood pressure fluctuation: The fluctuation of blood pressure between systole and diastole
    - Blood pressure fluctuation of the second order: The blood pressure decrease during inspiration and blood pressure increase during expiration. The duration of these fluctuations, in contrast to the first-order fluctuations, primarily depends on the respiratory rate.

> [!NOTE]
> In the daily measurement of arterial blood pressure of patients in the hospital, only the maximum systolic and minimum diastolic blood pressure are recorded, not the mean arterial pressure!

> [!NOTE] High blood pressure / Arterial hypertension
> If the repeatedly measured arterial blood pressure is higher than 140/90 mmHg, it is referred to as high blood pressure or arterial hypertension. It is one of the most common diseases in humans and is considered the main risk factor for other diseases of the cardiovascular system and for strokes. Since elevated arterial blood pressure often does not cause symptoms, its detection is frequently an incidental finding. Arterial hypertension is divided into essential (no known cause) and secondary (caused by another illness) forms based on the underlying cause. In secondary arterial hypertension, in addition to lowering blood pressure, the treatment of the underlying condition is primarily emphasized.

## Features of the Low-Pressure System

The low-pressure system exhibits significantly lower blood pressures than the high-pressure system. The venous blood pressure in the area of the right atrium and the large heart-adjacent veins is referred to as central venous pressure. This is subject to rhythmic fluctuations during the cardiac cycle, which can be described using the venous pulse curve. In the high-pressure system, the pumping power of the heart is sufficient to transport the blood. In the low-pressure system, however, the venous return must be supported by special mechanisms and structures such as the muscle pump or the venous valves.

### Central Venous Pressure (CVP)

- Definition: Blood pressure in the area of the right atrium and the heart-adjacent veins
- Dependent on: filling of the venous system, pumping capacity of the "right" heart, body position
- Fluctuations: Pulse and breath synchronized; pulse-synchronized pressure fluctuations are referred to as venous pulse.
- Reference norm value: 2–6 mmHg

> [!NOTE] Measurement of ZVD
> The measurement of the CVP is typically performed invasively via a central venous catheter (e.g., for monitoring during major surgeries or in the intensive care unit). In the physical examination, the CVP can be roughly estimated and can provide information about blood congestion in front of the right heart (e.g., in the context of so-called right heart failure).

#### Venous Pulse Curve

- Definition: The venous pulse curve represents the changes in central venous pressure during a cardiac cycle.
- Axes: x = Time [t], y = Pressure [mmHg]

|Phase of cardiac action|Course of the venous pulse curve|
|---|---|
|Ejection phase|- The heart contracts (with the valve leaflets open) → The plane of the valves is shifted towards the apex of the heart<br>- Suction is exerted on the veins close to the heart (valve plane mechanism) → Blood flows from the veins close to the heart into the right atrium<br>- Drop in CVP (so-called x-descent)|
|Relaxation phase|- Heart relaxes → Valve plane rises (with closed flaps)<br>- Blood cannot yet flow into the right ventricle<br>- Blood "backs up" before the right ventricle → Increase in central venous pressure (so-called v-wave)|
|Filling phase|- Blood flows into the right ventricle (with open atrioventricular valves) → CVP decreases (so-called y-descent)<br>- Ventricle increasingly fills → Blood flows less from the atrium into the right ventricle → CVP rises again<br>- End-diastolic contraction of the atria → Short steep rise of the CVP (so-called a-wave)|
|Tension Phase|- Heart contracts (with valves closed) → Blood in the ventricle presses on the leaflets of the tricuspid valve<br>- Tricuspid valve bulges slightly into the atrium → Slight increase in the CVP (so-called c-wave)|

> [!NOTE]
> The a-wave is caused by the contraction of the atrium, the v-wave by the rising plane of the valve, and the c-wave by the bulging of the cusps (leaflets) of the tricuspid valve into the atrium!

> [!NOTE]
> Positive inotropic effects (e.g., due to sympathetic action) lead to an increase in the a wave!

### Venous Return

- Definition: The venous return describes the movement of "venous" blood to the heart and occurs through various mechanisms of the low-pressure system.

|Mechanism of Venous Return|Functioning|
|---|---|
|Venous Valves|- Structure: Several adjacent intimate duplications<br>- Functions<br>    - Direct the blood flow (like valves)<br>    - Divide the blood column in the venous system|
|Muscle Pump|- Mechanism: Contraction of the skeletal muscles around the veins leads to their compression → "squeezing" of the veins towards the heart from vein valve to vein valve<br>- Requirement: Alternating contraction and relaxation of the skeletal muscles (e.g., while walking)|
|Breathing|- Increase in intrathoracic volume during inspiration → Pressure drops to subatmospheric (“negative”) pressures in the intrathoracic veins → Suction effect on intrathoracic veins → Venous blood is “pulled” toward the heart<br>- Lowering of the diaphragm during inspiration toward the abdomen → Increase in intra-abdominal pressure → Increase in pressures in intra-abdominal veins → Pressure effect on intra-abdominal veins → “Squeezing” of the veins toward the heart|
|Valve level mechanism|- Valve level descends towards the apex of the heart through contraction of the heart → Suction effect on the nearby heart veins|
|Arteriovenous Coupling|- Common course of arteries and veins → Pulse wave of the arteries is transmitted to the veins → "Squeezing" of the veins towards the heart from venous valve to venous valve|

> [!NOTE]
> In the high-pressure system, the pumping capacity of the heart is sufficient, so the mechanisms mentioned here in the high-pressure system are not necessary!

> [!NOTE]
> The respiratory-dependent suction/pressure effect on the venous system not only promotes venous return but also influences the central venous pressure (CVP). This decreases during inspiration ("suction effect") and increases during expiration ("pressure effect")!

## Hydrostatische Influences on Blood Pressure

Blood pressure is influenced on one hand by body factors and on the other hand by the force of gravity ("weight"). When gravity acts on a liquid, it creates what is known as hydrostatic pressure within it, which primarily depends on the height of the liquid column. The higher the continuous liquid column, the higher the hydrostatic pressure, as more water molecules rest in a vertical line with their weight. Therefore, blood pressure is higher in lower body parts and lower in higher body parts. The point in the body where blood pressure is equal when standing and lying down is called the hydrostatic indifference point.

### Hydrostatic Indifference Level

- Definition: Level of the body at which blood pressure is the same when standing and lying down.
- Location: About 10 cm below the diaphragm
- Rule of thumb for hydrostatic influences: For every 1 cm deviation from the indifference level, approximately 0.7 mmHg are added to the blood pressure (below the indifference level) or subtracted from it (above the indifference level).
    - Exception: Venous System
        - Influence on the column of fluid in a standing person through venous valves, muscle pump, and collapse of extracranial veins → Hydrostatic influence on venous blood pressure is lower than in the arterial system

## Review Questions on the Chapter Basics of the Circulatory System
### Anatomical and functional structure of the circulatory system

Describe the direction of blood flow in the pulmonary circulation!
- The so-called "small circulation" begins in the right atrium, from where the blood flows into the right ventricle and passes through the pulmonary trunk and the pulmonary arteries to the lungs into the capillary bed. Gas exchange takes place there. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins and empties into the left atrium.
### Physical Principles: Current and Resistance

What is referred to as volumetric flow rate and what do you understand by the continuity equation in this context? What does this mean for the flow velocity of blood in the body?
- The volumetric flow rate Q denotes the volume that flows through a system per unit of time (Q = ΔV / Δt). For example, the cardiac output corresponds to the total volumetric flow rate of the body. The continuity equation states that in a system of connected tubes, the volumetric flow rate is equally large everywhere. Since the volumetric flow rate is the product of the cross-sectional area A and the flow velocity vm (Q = A × vm), one can conclude that in the circulation the flow velocity and the vessel cross-section must behave oppositely. Accordingly, blood flows slower at large vessel cross-sections (e.g., in the capillary bed) and faster at small vessel cross-sections (e.g., in the area of a stenosis).
Explain Ohm's Law in relation to the circuit!
- Ohm’s law describes the relationship between volumetric flow rate, pressure difference, and resistance of flowing liquids: Q = ΔP / R (ΔP = pressure difference; R = flow resistance). The principle of Ohm’s law can be explained using the example of the Bayliss effect, which ensures constant perfusion of certain organs (e.g., brain, kidney): If blood pressure rises (ΔP↑), the resistance (R) must be increased to keep the volumetric flow rate (Q) constant.
What does the Hagen-Poiseuille law actually apply to and what does it state?
- The Hagen-Poiseuille law actually describes the volumetric flow rate Q of a laminar flowing Newtonian fluid in a rigid tube and is therefore only limitedly applicable to the human circulation. The law states that the volumetric flow rate in a tube depends most strongly on its radius (r^4): Q = [π × r^4 / (8 × η × l)] × ΔP (η = dynamic viscosity, l = vessel length).
What statement ultimately arises for the flow resistance in the human circulatory system when considering the Hagen-Poiseuille law and Ohm's law together?
- Since both Ohm’s law and the Hagen-Poiseuille law describe the volumetric flow rate Q, you can rearrange the formulas for Q and set them equal. This yields the so-called "adapted Hagen-Poiseuille law," which relates flow resistance to the radius: R = (8 × η × l) / (π × r^4). The main statement is R ∼ 1/r^4: smallest changes in vessel radius thus lead to extreme changes in flow resistance! Also, R is proportional to vessel length, as can be seen from the formula.
How do flow resistance, flow velocity, and blood pressure change in the area of a stenosis?
- In the area of a stenosis, both flow resistance and flow velocity increase. Before the stenosis, blood pressure is elevated; after it, it decreases.
How is the resistance calculated in parallel or consecutively connected vessels, and what are the actual resistances in the systemic and pulmonary circulation?
- The total resistance of perfused systems can be calculated using Kirchhoff’s laws. The total resistance of consecutively connected vessels is simply the sum of the individual resistances. For parallel vessels, the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances. The total resistance in the systemic circulation is about 11–20 mmHg × min/L, in the pulmonary circulation about 0.5–1 mmHg × min/L.
### Physical Principles: Blood Flow

Describe the flow properties of laminar and turbulent flows! What can cause a laminar flow to become turbulent?
- In laminar flows, the liquid moves in ordered, superimposed layers without vortices (the flow direction is therefore parallel to the vessel). The maximum flow velocity decreases near the vessel wall, resulting in a parabolic flow profile. With increasing flow velocity, laminar flow can transition into turbulent flow. In this case, the blood components are swirled during flow, resulting in unordered blood flow.
What is the so-called "Reynolds number"?
- The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity with which it can be estimated whether a liquid flows laminar or turbulent under certain conditions. Calculation of the Reynolds number: Re = (2 × r × ρ × v) / η (ρ = density, v = velocity, η = dynamic viscosity).
What influencing factors on blood viscosity do you know, and what role does the Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect play in this?
- Blood viscosity depends, among other things, on temperature, hematocrit, flow velocity, and vessel size. The Fåhraeus-Lindqvist effect denotes a reduction in apparent viscosity due to the serial arrangement of erythrocytes in the axial stream of vessels with a small diameter (7–10 μm).
### Characteristics of the High-Pressure System

How does the blood pressure amplitude change in aortic sclerosis?
- Normally, part of the energy and blood volume during systole can be temporarily stored by stretching the aorta (Windkessel function). In aortic sclerosis, however, the aortic wall becomes stiffer and loses elasticity, so this function is reduced. The systolic blood pressure rises because the resistance of the stiff aorta must be overcome. The diastolic blood pressure decreases because less blood volume and energy were stored and thus less can be released. Overall, the blood pressure amplitude increases (= the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure).
What is the so-called "pressure pulse," and is it faster or slower than the flow velocity?
- The pressure created by the heart during systole is transmitted through the vessels in the form of a pressure wave, which is described using the pressure pulse curve. The actual movement of the blood is slower than the propagation of the pressure wave.
How does blood pressure change during breathing?
- During inspiration, blood pressure decreases; during expiration, it increases. This breath-synchronous blood pressure change is referred to as second-order blood pressure fluctuation. The duration of these fluctuations depends mainly on the breathing rate.
### Features of the Low-Pressure System

How high is the central venous pressure (CVP) normally, and what happens to it during the filling phase?
- Central venous pressure (CVP) in healthy individuals is approximately 2–6 mmHg. During the filling phase, blood flows into the right ventricle and the CVP decreases (so-called "y-sink" in the venous pulse curve).
What effect do positive inotropic effects (e.g., through sympathetic action) have on the a-wave of the venous pulse curve?
- Positive inotropic effects (e.g., through sympathetic activation) lead to an increase of the a-wave of the venous pulse curve (= rise of the CVP).
What influence does breathing have on venous return?
- During inspiration, the intrathoracic volume increases, which leads to the creation of negative pressure, making the pressure in the intrathoracic veins negative. This creates a suction effect, and venous blood is transported toward the heart. At the same time, during inspiration, the diaphragm moves downward toward the abdomen, increasing intra-abdominal pressure. This pressure effect on intra-abdominal veins causes a "squeezing" of the veins toward the heart.
### Hydrostastic Influences on Blood Pressure

What is referred to as the hydrostatic indifference level and how does blood pressure change in relation to a deviation from it?
- The hydrostatic indifference level is the body level at which blood pressure is the same when standing and lying down. Per 1 cm deviation from the indifference level, about 0.7 mmHg is added to the blood pressure (below the indifference level) or subtracted from it (above the indifference level).
What is the approximate mean arterial blood pressure at heart level?
- At heart level, the mean arterial blood pressure is approximately 100 mmHg.
