# Cartilage Tissue
## Summary

The passive musculoskeletal system of the human body consists of bones and special connective tissue structures such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. These are moved by the active musculoskeletal system (skeletal muscles). To meet the mechanical demands that arise here, cartilage is a deformable and elastic tissue under pressure or tension. It consists of cartilage cells (chondrocytes) and a special extracellular matrix. In addition to the predominant hyaline cartilage (e.g., in the nasal septum), there are two other types of cartilage: fibrocartilage (e.g., in intervertebral discs) and elastic cartilage (e.g., in the auricle).

Cartilage is avascular and is nourished either by its perichondrium or by the synovial fluid (synovia) through diffusion. During skeletal development, many bones are first established as a cartilaginous model, which then ossifies over time, sometimes even only after birth. In particular, the cartilaginous epiphyseal plate responsible for the lengthening of long bones does not ossify until young adulthood.

## Components

Cartilage is an elastic tissue that consists of cartilage cells (chondrocytes and -blasts), their specific extracellular matrix, and a cartilage sheath. The different types of cartilage vary in the composition of their extracellular matrix and are described in more detail under "Overview and Structure of the Different Types of Cartilage."

### Cartilage Cells

- Chondroblasts
    - Proliferative cartilage cells that produce the extracellular matrix (ECM)
    - In adult cartilage, it is only present under the cartilage surface (regeneration)
- Chondrocytes: Cartilage cells, which develop from Chondroblasts
    - Are still capable of division during cartilage development, but lose their ability to divide in mature cartilage.
    - Are responsible for the turnover of the extracellular matrix and are found in so-called isogenic groups

### Extracellular Matrix (ECM) of Cartilage

- Producer: Chondroblasts and Chondrocytes
- Components: The exact composition of the components varies among the different types of cartilage and determines their different properties.
    - Various types of collagen
    - Glycosaminoglycans (e.g. Hyaluronan)
    - Proteoglycans (e.g. decorated with Aggrecan or Chondroitin sulfate bound Hyaluronan)
    - Glycoproteins (Chondronectin)

### Perichondrium (= Cartilage Skin)

- Definition: The perichondrium is a layer of cartilage tissue that surrounds the cartilage, nourishes it, and regenerates it.
- Construction
    - Stratum cellulare (=inner cellular layer): Contains chondrogenic precursor cells (Regeneration of damaged cartilage)
    - Stratum fibrosum (=outer connective tissue layer): Contains blood-, lymphatic vessels and nerves (nutrition of the cartilage tissue)

## Overview and Structure of Cartilage Types

There are different types of cartilage tissue: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage, with hyaline cartilage being the most widespread. Although the different types of cartilage are made up of the same basic elements (cartilage cells, extracellular matrix, and perichondrium), they differ in the composition of their extracellular matrix. As a result, they have different physical properties and serve various functions.

### Overview of Cartilage Types

1. Hyaline Cartilage (including Articular Cartilage)
2. Fibrocartilage
3. Elastic Cartilage

### Hyaline Cartilage

The hyaline cartilage is particularly elastic under pressure and consists of chondrocytes, which are organized in groups, and the extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix is referred to as territory in the area of the chondrocyte groups and as interterritory between the neighboring groups.

- Main property: Compressibility
- Construction
    - Perichondrium: Present (see above)
    - Chondrocytes
        - Appearance: Oval/round shape with many glycogen deposits
        - Arrangement: They lie together in groups, whose cells all contain the same genetic information (so-called isogenic groups)
    - Extracellular matrix (ECM)
        - Main components
            - Collagen fibrils (primarily Collagen type II, less type IX and XI), which do not aggregate into collagen fibers in cartilage
            - Proteoglycans (mainly Aggrecan/Hyaluronan aggregate)
        - Nomenclature of EZM areas: In the EZM, the areas are distinguished from those between adjacent isogenic groups based on an isogenic group.
            - Territories ("Cartilage Court"): EZM for an isogenic chondrocyte group
                - Histological feature: Basophilia here is stronger due to the production of polyanionic proteoglycans
            - Interterritorial: EZM between neighboring chondrocyte groups
                - Histological special feature: Basophilia here weaker
            - Chondron: Isogene Group + associated Territory
- Examples of hyaline cartilage
    - Articular cartilage
    - Cartilage braces of the airways
    - Nasal septum
    - Costal cartilage
    - Cartilaginous precursors of the skeleton (Primordial skeleton)

> [!NOTE]
> When observing cartilage preparations in histology, the chondrocytes usually appear fragmented, leaving cartilage cavities with an apparent capsule. However, this effect is due to the preparation process!

#### Special case of hyaline cartilage: Articular cartilage

In so-called true joints, two bone ends are separated by a joint gap. These bone ends are covered with a special hyaline cartilage, known as articular cartilage. Unlike hyaline cartilage, this cartilage does not have a perichondrium responsible for the nourishment and regeneration of the cartilage. Therefore, articular cartilage cannot regenerate and must be nourished by the synovial fluid (synovia). The special properties of articular cartilage are partly due to the arc-like arrangement of the collagen fibrils, which are anchored like an inverted "U" in the subchondral bone.

- Special Features
    - High pressure elasticity
    - Shock absorption
    - More even distribution of forces over the joint surface
- Difference from hyaline cartilage: No perichondrium
- Structure of a joint cartilage (From Epi- to Diaphysis)
    - Zone I: Tangential zone of the articular cartilage
        - Peak of the U-shaped collagen fibrils
        - Collagen fibrils run approximately horizontally or tangentially to the cartilage surface in the tangential zone.
    - Zone II: Transitional zone of the articular cartilage
        - Represents the transition between Zone I and III.
    - Zone III: Radial zone of the articular cartilage
        - Collagen fibrils running perpendicular to the cartilage surface
        - Separation to Zone IV light microscope clearly visible (boundary line)
    - Zone IV: Mineralization zone of the articular cartilage
        - Collagen fibers are anchored here
        - Extracellular matrix contains hydroxyapatite crystals
        - Interlocking with the underlying subchondral bone
- Formation of the compressibility of joint cartilage: Cartilage is deformed under pressure and returns to its original shape when the pressure decreases.
    1. Proteoglycans of cartilage bind large amounts of water and expand in the process.
    2. Collagen fibrils prevent the proteoglycans from fully extending: Proteoglycans resemble partially compressed "spring coils" (the expansion tendency of proteoglycans vs. the pull of collagen fibrils)
    3. Under additional pressure, water flows out of the cartilage and the "proteoglycan-springs" are compressed.
    4. When the pressure decreases, the water flows back into the cartilage and the "proteoglycan-spring fibers" expand again as much as the collagen fibrils allow.

> [!NOTE]
> The shape of the collagen fibrils in hyaline articular cartilage corresponds to an inverted "U" (so-called arcades) anchored in the bone. They extend vertically from the depth of zone IV into zone III and become increasingly horizontal in zone II, only to dive back toward zone IV at their peak in zone I!

> [!NOTE] Arthritis and arthritis signs
> If there is an over- or improper load on a joint cartilage, this leads, among other things, to a reduced proteoglycan synthesis (especially aggrecan), which critically affects the cartilage's elasticity and thus its "shock absorption." With the progression of the disease, there is, on the one hand, an increasing loss of substance and function of the cartilage (e.g., so-called bone baldness) and, on the other hand, damage to the structures involved in the joint (e.g., subchondral sclerosis). Diagnostically, one can make use of the so-called "demasking" of collagen fibrils. This means that the previously invisible ("masked") collagen fibrils under a light microscope become visible ("demasked"; so-called asbestos fibers) through pathological processes. Reactively, these processes can lead, on the one hand, to mostly insufficient repair attempts (e.g., abnormal cartilage proliferation, formation of osteophytes) and, on the other hand, to inflammatory processes (so-called activated osteoarthritis).

### Articular Cartilage

- Special properties: compression elastic and tensile strong
- Differences to hyaline cartilage
    - Extracellular matrix mainly consists of collagen fibers (especially collagen type I)
    - Contains few chondrocytes with narrow acidophilic territory ("cartilage zone")
    - Perichondrium: Not present
- Examples
    - Knee joint menisci
    - Intervertebral discs
    - Pubic symphysis

### Elastic Cartilage

- Special properties: Very pressure and bend elastic
- Differences to hyaline cartilage
    - Contains many elastic fibers that penetrate into the perichondrium â†’ High compressive and bending elasticity
    - Cell-rich cartilage with barely visible territories
- Examples
    - Auricle
    - External auditory canal
    - Epiglottis

## Development, Growth, and Regeneration

Cartilage tissue develops from mesenchymal cells that differentiate into chondroblasts. Through the proliferation of chondroblasts and their production of the extracellular matrix, the cartilage tissue grows. With the exception of articular cartilage and fibrocartilage, a distinct cartilage sheath (perichondrium) forms around the developing cartilage tissue from mesenchymal cells. Within this, there are undifferentiated cartilage precursor cells that can either allow the cartilage tissue to grow further through the addition of new cartilage cells (appositional growth) or can regenerate dead cartilage cells. These processes occur, among other things, during the formation of later cartilage tissue, during skeletal development (chondral ossification), and during length growth at the cartilaginous epiphyseal plate.

1. At the beginning of cartilage development, mesenchymal cells aggregate and differentiate into chondroblasts.
2. The chondroblasts proliferate and produce the specific extracellular matrix of cartilage, while they are pushed apart by the increasing (intervening) extracellular matrix.
3. The cartilage structure grows overall through the proliferation of chondroblasts and their extracellular matrix production (so-called interstitial growth).
4. The chondrocytes remain grouped in so-called isogenous groups after the completion of proliferation or cartilage growth.
5. The mesenchymal cells at the edge of the cartilage structure differentiate into fibroblasts, which form a connective tissue capsule (perichondrium or periosteum).
6. Undifferentiated cells remain in the innermost layer of the perichondrium and can differentiate into chondroblasts.
7. Either the cartilage can grow through the addition of "new" chondroblasts (so-called appositional growth) or destroyed chondrocytes are regenerated (regeneration).

> [!NOTE]
> The regeneration of cartilage tissue originates from undifferentiated cartilage precursor cells of the perichondrium. Therefore, the articular cartilage, which does not have a perichondrium, cannot be regenerated!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Cartilage Tissue
### Overview and Structure of Cartilage Types

What are the three types of cartilage tissue? Name the characteristic fiber type that can be found in the extracellular matrix for each cartilage type!
- There are three types distinguished: hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage. In hyaline cartilage, the typical arcade structure of type II collagen fibers provides compressive strength. In contrast, fibrocartilage contains a pronounced matrix of type I collagen, which forms fiber networks there and thus ensures particular tensile strength. In elastic cartilage, elastic fibers are mainly found, whose highly branched fiber networks assure the elasticity, i.e., the resilience, of this cartilage type.

What is the most common type of cartilage and where in the body does it occur?
- Out of the three cartilage types, hyaline cartilage tissue is the most common in the body. It is found especially on joint surfaces in the form of articular cartilage, but also in the nasal septum and in the cartilaginous rings of the airways. Additionally, it forms the growth plates of bones during skeletal development.
