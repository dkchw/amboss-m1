# Eye and Orbit
## Summary

The eye consists of the bulbus oculi, N. opticus, eyelids, and the tear apparatus. Additionally, several muscles facilitate targeted movement of the bulbus oculi and the other components of the eye. Histologically, the various areas of the eye are constructed very differently, adapted to their respective functions. The arterial supply of the eye is provided by branches of the A. ophthalmica. Both the sensory innervation and the movement of the eye by the external eye muscles are mediated by cranial nerves. Accommodation using the internal eye muscles is controlled by fibers of the autonomic nervous system. For protection, the eye is located within the bony orbital cavity.
## Eyeball

The almost spherical bulbus oculi (eyeball) is well protected in the orbital cavity. Its covering consists of three layers: the outer tunica fibrosa bulbi, the middle tunica vasculosa bulbi, and the inner tunica interna bulbi. The interior of the bulbus is divided into an anterior and a posterior chamber of the eye. It also contains the vitreous body and the lens. Furthermore, the bulbus can be functionally divided into a light-refracting and a light-perceiving apparatus.

### Profile

- Function: Part of the visual organ
- Location: Orbital Cavity
- Shape: Spherical
- Diameter: approx. 24 mm
- Weight: 6–8 g

### Guidelines

For the topographical description, there are various orientation lines.

- Äquator : Trennt die etwa gleich großen vorderen und hinteren Anteile des Bulbus oculi
- External axis of the eyeball (external eye axis): Runs from the anterior pole of the eye to the posterior pole
- Internal axis of the eyeball (inner eye axis): Runs from the posterior surface of the cornea to the anterior surface of the retina.
- Optic axis (visual axis): Runs from the center of curvature of the cornea to the fovea centralis

### Functional Structure

Based on their function, the components of the eyeball can be divided into a dioptric and a light-sensitive apparatus.

- Refracting/dioptric apparatus
    - Components: Cornea, Lens, Vitreous body, Aqueous humor
    - Function: Bundling of incoming light for point-like imaging on the retina
- Light-sensing apparatus
    - Component: Retina
    - Function
        - Conversion of a light stimulus into electrical impulses
        - Transmission of electrical impulses via the optic nerve to the brain

## Wall Layers

The shell of the bulbus oculi consists of three concentrically arranged layers. The outer tunica fibrosa bulbi, the middle tunica vasculosa bulbi (uvea), and the inner tunica interna bulbi (retina). The histological structure of the individual eye components varies significantly due to their different functions. The retina, for example, is made up of many different layers, which include the first three neurons of the visual pathway.

### Fibrous coat of the eyeball

The tunica fibrosa bulbi is the stable outer layer of the eye that ensures its round shape. It consists of the cornea in the front part and the sclera in the back section.

#### Cornea (Cornea)

- Function: Refraction of Light (see also: Visual Perception)
- Structure: From ventral to dorsal
    1. Anterior corneal epithelium: Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
    2. Bowman membrane (anterior limiting layer): Cell-free, crossing collagen fibers
    3. Ground substance: Layers of parallel collagen fibers, as well as fibroblasts, proteoglycans, and water
        - A specific arrangement of the collagen fibers is essential for the transparency of the cornea.
    4. Descemet membrane (posterior limiting membrane): Thickness basement membrane
    5. Posterior corneal endothelium: Simple squamous epithelium

> [!NOTE]
> The cornea is avascular; its nourishment comes from the diffusion of tear fluid and aqueous humor!

#### Sclera (Corneal layer)

The sclera is opaque and makes up the "white" of the eye. The transition from the cornea to the sclera is referred to as the limbus corneae.

- Function: Protective function and shaping for the eyeball
- Structure: Mainly consists of connective tissue
    - Episcleral layer: Loose collagenous connective tissue
    - Lamina propria: Dense collagenous connective tissue
    - Lamina fusca: Loose collagenous connective tissue with embedded melanocytes
- Lamina cribrosa sclerae: Sieve-like recesses at the back part for the fibers of the N. opticus

### Vascular Tunic of the Eyeball (Uvea)

The vascular tunic of the bulb consists of the iris and ciliary body in the front part and the choroid in the back part.

#### Iris

The iris (cornea) has an opening (pupil) in its center, whose width can be changed using the iris muscles.

- Function
    - Regulation of light incidence
    - Eye color
- Construction
    - Outside: Incompletely covered with fibroblasts and melanocytes
    - Stroma: M. sphincter pupillae
    - Inside: Two layers
        - Ventral layer: M. dilatator pupillae (in the form of radially oriented myoepithelial cells)
        - Dorsal layer: Pigmented epithelium

#### Choroid (Choroid)

The choroid is located between the sclera and the retina. A large portion of the blood that reaches the eye flows through it (up to 80%).

- Function: Supply of the retina
- Aufbau: Von außen nach innen
    - Lamina suprachorioidea: Larger vessels, connective tissue, melanocytes
    - Vascular lamina: Arterioles
    - Choriocapillary layer: Capillaries
- Bruch membrane: layer of elastic fibers between the lamina chorioidocapillaris and the retina

#### Ciliary body (Iris body)

- Structure and Function
    - Zonular fibers: Suspension of the lens
    - Two-layered ciliary epithelium that represents the ciliary part of the pars caeca retinae
        - Non-pigmented epithelium (inner layer of the ciliary body): production and secretion of aqueous humor
        - Pigmented epithelium (outer layer of the ciliary body): Participates in aqueous humor production (see below) with
    - Smooth Muscle (Ciliary muscle): Accommodation (Eye)

> [!NOTE]
> Iris, Choroid and Ciliary body are collectively referred to as Uvea!

> [!NOTE] Marfan Syndrome  
> The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by a mutation in the Fibrillin-1-gene. The Fibrillin-1-gene encodes the protein Fibrillin-1, which plays a crucial role in the formation of connective tissue. The faulty synthesis of connective tissue leads to pathological changes in various organ systems—mainly affecting the skeletal system, the cardiovascular system, and the eyes. Characteristic features include tall stature, hyperelasticity of the joints, and malformations of the heart and aorta (particularly aneurysms, dissections). Since the zonular fibers of the eye are largely composed of Fibrillin-1, patients often experience lens dislocation, which typically manifests as monocular double vision (double vision when viewing with only one eye).

### Tunica interna bulbi (Retina)

The retina forms the innermost layer of the eyeball and is responsible for visual perception. It consists of a pars optica (light-sensitive part) and a pars caeca (light-insensitive part). The pars optica lines the posterior part, while the pars caeca lines the anterior part of the eye. The boundaries between the two sections are formed by the so-called ora serrata. The pars caeca can also be further divided into a pars ciliaris (covers the posterior surface of the ciliary body) and a pars iridica (covers the posterior surface of the iris).

#### Blind spot of the retina

The pars caeca retinae is the anterior part of the retina, which is insensitive to light and consists solely of pigment epithelium.

- Pars ciliaris: Covers the posterior surface of the ciliary body
- Pars iridica: Covers the posterior surface of the iris

#### Optical parts of the retina

Die Pars optica retinae ist der hintere Teil der Retina, der lichtempfindlich ist und sowohl aus Pigmentepithel als auch aus den ersten 3 Neuronen der Sehbahn besteht.

- Stratum pigmentosum (outer on the Bruch membrane): Consists of a single layer of isoprismatic pigment epithelium.
- Nervous stratum (inner): Contains (from outside to inside) the first three neurons of the visual pathway (1. Photoreceptor cells, 2. Bipolar cells, 3. Ganglion cells)
    - Stratum neuroepitheliale: Enthält die Außen- und Innensegmente der Photorezeptorzellen
        - Rods (Photoreceptors): Light-sensitive cells responsible for twilight and black-and-white vision.
        - Cones (Photoreceptors): Low light sensitivity; responsible for seeing in daylight and color vision
    - Stratum limitans externum (outer limiting membrane): Contains Müller cells that support the receptor cells and extend throughout the entire nerve layer.
    - Stratum nucleare externum (outer nuclear layer): Contains the perikarya of the photoreceptor cells (1st neuron)
    - Stratum plexiforme externum (outer plexiform layer): Contains the synapses between the processes of the 1st and 2nd neurons as well as synapses with the horizontal cells.
    - Stratum nucleare internum (inner nuclear layer): Contains the perikarya of the bipolar cells (2nd neuron), amacrine cells, Müller cells, and horizontal cells.
    - Stratum plexiforme internum (inner plexiform layer): Contains the synapses between the processes of the 2nd and 3rd neurons
    - Ganglionic stratum (Ganglion cell layer): Contains the perikarya of the ganglion cells (3. neuron)
    - Stratum neurofibrarum (nerve fiber layer): Contains the fibers of the ganglion cells
    - Stratum limitans internum (inner glial limiting membrane): Contains the end feet of the Müller cells

> [!NOTE]
> The photoreceptors form the outermost layer. The incoming light must first penetrate all other layers before it reaches the photoreceptors and can be perceived by them!

##### Special Areas of the Retina

- Discus n. optici („Ort des blinden Flecks“): Der blinde – d.h. kein Licht wahrnehmende – Austrittspunkt des N. opticus, der einen bds. physiologischen Gesichtsfeldausfall von ca. 15° temporal verursacht
- Macula lutea ("yellow spot") with the Fovea centralis
    - Definition: Oval field (approximately 1×2 mm) lateral to the bulb axis, which contains the fovea centralis in the center (the point of sharpest vision)
    - Structure of the Fovea centralis
        - Vessel-free area where only cones occur in high density
        - Contains in the center the foveola centralis, where all other structures of the retina are shifted laterally, so that the cones are directly illuminated.
- Ora serrata: Forms the boundary between the Pars caeca retinae and the Pars optica retinae

> [!NOTE]
> In the fovea centralis, only cone cells are present, while in the periphery of the retina, predominantly rod cells are found!

> [!NOTE] Vision assessment
> The visual acuity describes the sharpness of vision at the point of best sight, namely at the fovea centralis. The visual acuity can be determined by testing with so-called Landolt rings. These are rings that vary in size and have openings at different locations, whose orientation must be recognized by the test subject. Visual acuity is defined as V = 1/α, where α corresponds to the gap that can just barely be recognized by a person (given in angle minutes). The stroke thicknesses and openings of the Landolt rings are constructed so that they appear under a visual angle of one angle minute. This means that a person with normal vision can resolve the visual angle of one angle minute and thus has a visual acuity of 1 (Visual acuity = 1/angle minute (α)). If the gap needs to be twice as wide to be recognized, the visual acuity is 0.5.

## Interior

Aside from the various layers of the wall, the lens and the anterior and posterior chambers are also components of the eyeball. While the lens is responsible for light refraction and accommodation, the anterior and posterior chambers primarily facilitate the collection and transmission of aqueous humor. The vitreous cavity, which is also part of the chambers, lies behind the anterior and posterior chambers and is composed of almost 99% water. Its function is to maintain the round shape of the eyeball.

### Eye Lens (Lens)

The lens of the eye is partially covered by the iris; it is located with its central part directly behind the pupil (the opening of the iris).

- Function
    - Refraction (Collective Lens)
    - Accommodation (Eye)
- Form
    - Biconvex
    - Stronger curvature on the rear surface than on the front surface
- Structure of the lens components
    - Capsule: Firm collagen fibers
    - Epithel: Einschichtiges Epithel an der Innenseite der vorderen Linsenkapsel
    - Yield: Young lentil fibers
    - Nucleus: Older lens fibers (the younger fibers accumulate from the outside)
- Suspensory apparatus: Zonular fibers, which originate from the ciliary body, pass through the posterior chamber of the eye and attach to the front and back of the lens capsule.

> [!NOTE]
> The lens is – like the cornea – avascular; its nourishment occurs through diffusion from the aqueous humor!


> [!NOTE] Presbyopia
> The lens is elastic and returns to its spherical resting shape on its own when the zonular fibers are relaxed. This deformation serves to increase the refractive power for near accommodation. Over the course of life, there is a release of water primarily from the older lens fibers in the nucleus, causing it to harden and often also become yellowish. The lens loses a significant amount of elasticity and no longer returns to its spherical resting shape. As a result, the accommodation range decreases and the near point shifts further away. This leads to age-related farsightedness (presbyopia), which is noticeable, for example, when reading.

> [!NOTE] Cataract
> The lens is transparent due to its high content of specially soluble proteins (crystallin proteins) and a specifically defined water content. As metabolism within the lens slows down with age, the balance of proteins and water can become disturbed, causing the lens to lose its transparency and resulting in clouding (cataract). Patients suffer from a deterioration of vision ("foggy vision") and sensitivity to glare. A cataract can very rarely be congenital, for example, in cases of a rubella infection in the mother during pregnancy.

### Chambers of the Eye

- Posterior chamber of the eye (Camera posterior bulbi): Takes in the produced aqueous humor from the ciliary body and directs it through the pupil into the anterior chamber of the eye
- Anterior chamber of the eye (Camera anterior bulbi): Directs the aqueous humor into the Schlemm's canal
- Vitreous body (Corpus vitreum)
    - Consists of a gelatinous substance with almost 99% water content
    - Takes on the shape of the bulbus oculi
    - Is traversed by the Cloquet Canal

### Chamber Water

The aqueous humor supplies the avascular lens and cornea and maintains the intraocular pressure. It is produced by the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary processes of the ciliary body and flows through the Schlemm canal of the anterior chamber angle into the episcleral veins.

#### Kammerwasserproduktion

- Source: Blood plasma from the capillaries of the ciliary processes of the ciliary body
- Way
    - Die Plasmabestandteile gelangen von den Kapillaren in das Stroma des Ciliarkörpers
    - Weiter gelangen die Bestandteile in die pigmentierten Epithelzellen des Ciliarkörpers und schließlich über Gap Junctions in das nicht-pigmentierte Epithel
    - From there, they reach the posterior chamber of the eye directly through various mechanisms.
        - Secretion
        - Ultrafiltration
        - Diffusion

#### Chamber angle

- Synonym: Iridescorial Angle
- Limitations: Iris, Cornea and Sclera
- Schlemm Canal
    - Definition: Circular canal running around the eye in the scleral portion of the anterior chamber angle
    - Function: Absorption of the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye and drainage into the episcleral veins
    - Transport of the chamber water
        - Through the chamber angle, fenestrated connective tissue strands (trabeculae) draw.
        - Between the trabeculae, there are gaps (Fontana spaces) through which the aqueous humor can seep from the anterior chamber of the eye into the Schlemm's canal.
        - Von dort gelangt es erst in die skleralen, dann in die episkleralen Venen

> [!NOTE]
> The aqueous humor is primarily needed for the supply of the cornea and lens, as these tissues do not possess any blood vessels and rely on supply through diffusion!

> [!NOTE] Glaucoma
> A well-functioning interplay of aqueous humor production and resorption is important to ensure a constant pressure of 14–20 mmHg. In the case of a drainage disorder of the aqueous humor, an increase in intraocular pressure may occur, which can result in a glaucoma (green star). Depending on the various drainage obstructions, three types are distinguished: open-angle glaucoma (92% of all glaucomas), angle-closure glaucoma (7% of all glaucomas), and congenital glaucoma (1% of all glaucomas). Both angle-closure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma (persistent embryonic tissue in the anterior chamber angle) involve a blockage of the anterior chamber angle. In contrast, in open-angle glaucoma, the drainage disorder is not in the anterior chamber angle, but elsewhere (e.g., in the trabecular meshwork). Due to the increased intraocular pressure, damage to the optic nerve may occur, particularly at the margin of the optic disc, which can result in bilateral paracentral visual field loss. Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness (after macular degeneration). In the case of a glaucoma attack, the eye becomes red and painful, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting; even sudden vision loss is possible.

> [!NOTE] Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor  
> The carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that, among other things, occurs in the pigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary body and catalyzes the formation of HCO3− and H+ from H2O and CO2. In exchange for the produced H+-ions, Na+-ions and, in exchange for HCO3−, Cl−-ions initially enter the pigmented epithelial cells and then pass directly into the non-pigmented epithelial cells through gap junctions. From there, the ions reach the aqueous humor as part of it and enter the posterior chamber of the eye. If the intraocular pressure is too high due to an outflow obstruction in the angle of the chamber (so-called angle-closure glaucoma), the production of aqueous humor can be reduced with the help of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thus lowering the intraocular pressure.

## Conjunctiva

The conjunctiva connects the eyelids with the eyeball.

|Sections of the Conjunctiva|Structure|Location|Function|
|---|---|---|---|
|Conjunctiva tarsi|- Stratified squamous epithelium or stratified cuboidal epithelium with embedded goblet cells|- Covers the inner surface of the eyelids|- Formation of a sliding layer<br>- Wetting of the bulbus oculi<br>- Immune defense|
|Conjunctiva bulbi|- Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium and stroma made of connective tissue with embedded goblet cells, immune cells, and blood vessels|- Covers the anterior part of the sclera|
|Superior and inferior conjunctival fornix|- Stratified cylindrical epithelium with embedded goblet cells|- Transition between tarsal conjunctiva and the bulbar conjunctiva with reserve folds|
## Tear Apparatus

The tear apparatus consists of the lacrimal gland (Glandula lacrimalis) at the upper outer corner of the eyelid, the Meibomian glands of the inner eyelid membrane, and the goblet cells of the conjunctiva. The tear fluid itself is structured in three layers and primarily serves to wash and disinfect the eye.

### Components

- Lacrimal gland
    - Location: In the fossa of the lacrimal gland of the frontal bone (above the lateral canthus)
    - Structure
        - 8–12 execution cycles, however without shift and strip pieces
        - Tubuloalveolar end pieces with a wide lumen
    - Division: By the tendon of the M. levator palpebrae into a Pars palpebralis and a Pars orbitalis
    - Secret: Serous
    - Innervation: Parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve (pterygopalatine ganglion)
- Meibom-Drüsen
- Goblet cells of the conjunctiva

### Tear Fluid

- Composition: Isotonic saline solution (Na+, K+, Cl−, bicarbonate), proteins (e.g. lysozyme, lactoferrin, α- and β-defensins), epidermal growth factor (EGF), IgA
- Layers: Three-layered
    1. Outer lipophilic phase from the Meibomian glands
    2. Medium aqueous phase from the lacrimal gland
    3. Inner mucin phase from the goblet cells of the conjunctiva
- Distribution
    - Blinking distributes tear fluid across the eye
    - Tears collect nasally in the Lacus lacrimalis ("tear lake")
    - Drainage through the puncta lacrimalia in the upper and lower lid via the canaliculi lacrimales into the lacrimal sac
    - Reaches the inferior nasal meatus (lower nasal passage) via the nasolacrimal duct.
- Functions
    - Flushing and disinfection of the eye
    - Healing of minor wounds
    - Formation of an even surface
    - Supply of the cornea through diffusion
## Eyelids

The eyelids form the anterior boundary of the orbit and mainly serve to mechanically protect the globe of the eye. Additionally, some glands are embedded within them, whose function is to moisten and lubricate the eye.

### Structure

In the eyelids, one distinguishes between an upper and a lower lid (palpebra superior and palpebra inferior); furthermore, an outer lid layer is differentiated from an inner lid layer.

#### Outer eyelid sheet

- Components: Skin and M. orbicularis oculi (see below)

#### Inner eyelid sheet

- Components
    - Tarsus superior and inferior: Reinforcing plates made of collagenous connective tissue
    - Muscles
        - M. levator palpebrae superioris (sup.)
        - M. tarsalis superior and inferior (see below)
    - Glands
        - Meibomian glands: Sebaceous glands with lipid and protein-rich secretion within the tarsus
        - Moll glands: Sweat glands in the area of the eyelash roots
        - Zeis glands: Sebaceous glands in the area of the eyelash roots
        - Krause glands: Components of the lacrimal gland in the area of the conjunctiva tarsi
        - Wolfring glands: Parts of the lacrimal gland in the area of the tarsal conjunctiva
    - Tarsal conjunctiva (s.o.)
    - Eyelashes (Cilia): Short resilient hairs without erecting muscles

### Functions

- Mechanical protection
- Lichtschutz
- Protection against drying out of the eye

> [!NOTE] Blink reflex
> The cornea is sensitively supplied by the N. ophthalmicus. In case of irritation of the cornea, the M. orbicularis oculi (eye closure) is activated and the M. levator palpebrae superioris (eyelid lifter) is inhibited. At the same time, there is a rotation of the eye upwards and outwards ("Bell phenomenon"). This reflex is called the eyelid closure reflex and can be triggered by touching the cornea from the temporal side, for example with a cotton swab. The eyelid closure reflex protects the bulbus oculi.

## Muscles of the Eye

The movement of the eyeball is mediated by four straight and two oblique eye muscles, which attach at different points on the eyeball and thus allow for different rotations. They are exclusively controlled by cranial nerves. The eyelid has both voluntarily controlled muscles for coarse and autonomically controlled muscles for fine movements. The internal eye muscles, on the other hand, are exclusively innervated by the autonomic nervous system and are responsible for adjusting the lens.

### External Eye Muscles

The extrinsic eye muscles consist of striated muscle that is controlled by the cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. They are responsible for eye movements and are classified into rectus and oblique eye muscles.

- Basics
    - Internal and external rotation: Rotation around the sagittal axis
    - Abduction and Adduction: Movement on the vertical axis
    - Elevation and Depression (Movement): Movement in the transverse axis

|Type|Name|Origin|Approach|Function at the Bulb [1]|Innervation|Fundamentals|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Just now Eye muscles|M. rectus superior|Tendinous ring|Above (middle) on the eyeball (in front of the equator)|- Elevation<br>- Adduction<br>- Slight internal rotation|N. oculomotorius (III): R. superior|The two muscles are most effective when the eye is abducted|
|M. rectus inferior|Tendinous ring|Below (middle) at the bulbus oculi (in front of the equator)|- Depression (movement)<br>- Adduction<br>- Slight external rotation|N. oculomotorius (III): R. inferior|
|M. rectus medialis|Tendinous ring|Nasal to the bulbus oculi (in front of the equator)|- Adduction|N. oculomotorius (III): R. inferior|The two muscles function synergistically (act as a pair when looking to the side)|
|M. rectus lateralis|Tendinous ring|Temporal at the eyeball (in front of the equator)|- Abduction (rotation of the eyeball outward)|Abducens nerve (VI)|
|Oblique eye muscles|M. obliquus superior|Tendinous ring and sphenoid bone|Above in the posterior lateral quadrant at the bulbus oculi (behind the equator)|- Depression (movement)<br>- Abduction<br>- Internal rotation|N. trochlearis (IV)|The two muscles are most effective when the eye is adducted|
|M. obliquus inferior|Medial orbital wall near the lacrimal fossa|Lower in the posterior lateral quadrant at the bulbus oculi (behind the equator)|- Elevation<br>- Abduction<br>- External rotation|N. oculomotorius (III): R. inferior|

> [!NOTE]
> The superior oblique muscle does not pull directly to the eyeball but uses the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle at the medial orbital rim as a hypomochlion and is deflected there; the innervating cranial nerve is called N. trochlearis!

### Inner Eye Muscles

The internal eye muscles consist of smooth muscle and are responsible for the pupil diameter as well as for accommodation (eye). They are controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

|Name|Course|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|
|M. sphincter pupillae|Surrounds the pupil in the connective tissue of the iris|Miosis|Parasympathetic nervous system (via the oculomotor nerve)|
|M. dilatator pupillae|Runs as part of the iris epithelium around the pupil|Mydriasis|Sympathetic nervous system|
|Ciliary muscle|Connects zonules with sclera and choroid|- Accommodation for near vision: When the ciliary muscle contracts, the zonules relax → the lens curvature (and thus the refractive power) increases → Accommodation for near vision<br>- Aqueous humor drainage: When the meridional fibers of the ciliary muscle contract, they help keep the Schlemm's canal and the anterior trabecular meshwork in the anterior chamber angle open|Parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve (III)|

> [!NOTE] Pharmacological influence on pupil diameter
> The pupil diameter can be altered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes using medications. If the pupil needs to be constricted (miosis), for example, to facilitate the outflow of aqueous humor in the context of a glaucoma, direct parasympathomimetics (e.g., carbachol) can be used. By binding to M-cholinergic receptors, a cholinergic effect occurs at the M. sphincter pupillae, leading to miosis. Dilation of the pupil (mydriasis), for example, for ophthalmological examinations, can be achieved through the administration of atropine(derivatives). These act as antagonists at the parasympathetic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors of the M. sphincter pupillae. Due to the predominance of the sympathetic nervous system at the M. dilatator pupillae, mydriasis occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> When you say the word "miosis," your mouth hardly opens (pupil constricted). In contrast, when you say "mydriasis," your mouth opens wide (pupil dilated).

### Muscles of the Eyelid

#### Striated Muscle

|Name|   |Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. orbicularis oculi (belongs to the facial musculature)|Pars orbitalis|Medial canthus|Surrounds the eye|- Eye closure<br>- Squinting|N. facialis (VII)|
|Palpebral part|Skin of the eyelid|- Blinking<br>- Expression of the Meibomian glands by the Riolan muscle|
|Lacrimal ducts|Eyelid margins|- Expression of the tear sac|
|M. levator palpebrae superioris|   |Lesser wing of the sphenoid bone|- Superficial lamina: Upper eyelid<br>- Deep lamina: Superior tarsus|- Eyelid lift|Oculomotor nerve (III): R. superior|

#### Smooth Muscle

|Name|   |Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. tarsalis superior|   |Fascia of the M. levator palpebrae superioris|Upper lid plate|- Elevation of the upper lid<br>- Adjustment of the palpebral fissure width|- Sympathetic nervous system: Fibers are relayed in the superior cervical ganglion and then travel via the internal carotid plexus and the ciliary ganglion to the muscle without further relay|
|M. tarsalis inferior|   |Fornix conjunctivae inferior|Lower lid plate|- Slight elevation of the lower lid<br>- Adjustment of the palpebral fissure width|- Sympathetic system: Fibers of the superior cervical ganglion|

> [!NOTE] Sakkaden and Nystagmus
> The bulb is movable via the six extraocular muscles. When both eyes move together at the same speed in one direction, it is called conjugate eye movement. When objects move slowly, they are continuously represented on the fovea through gliding conjugate eye pursuit movements. Fast objects are tracked and fixated on by jerky eye movements known as saccades. An image is formed on the retina only at the fixation points, while vision is suppressed during a saccade. Saccades cannot be voluntarily interrupted. They usually do not hit their target exactly and are then reflexively corrected. The alternation between slow and fast eye movements is called “nystagmus,” with the direction of the nystagmus always being named after the quick saccades.

> [!NOTE] Paralytic strabismus (Strabismus paralyticus) 
> Through various disturbances (e.g. cranial nerve syndromes) or injuries, individual eye muscles may fail, which is initially referred to as "ocular muscle paresis" (ocular muscle paralysis). The main symptom of ocular muscle paresis is the perception of double vision (diplopia), triggered by strabismus. The double vision is most pronounced when the patient looks in the direction of the paralyzed muscle. If the affected or even the healthy eye is covered, the double vision (binocular double vision) disappears. The most common causes of ocular muscle paresis include diabetes mellitus, aneurysms or brain tumors. If the cause of the symptom is still unknown, the examiner should therefore initiate further diagnostic investigations.

## Vascular Supply

All arteries supplying the eye originate from the A. ophthalmica, which branches off from the A. carotis interna just above the sinus cavernosus and then enters the orbita alongside the N. opticus through the canalis opticus. Venous drainage occurs through various tributaries into the V. ophthalmica superior and the V. ophthalmica inferior, which then empty into the sinus durae matris of the brain. The eye is innervated by sensory, parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers.

> [!NOTE]
> Retina, lens, vitreous body and choroid are not sensitively innervated!

> [!NOTE]
> The Vv. ophthalmicae have a connection to the V. facialis through the V. angularis. This creates an anastomosis between extra- and intracranial veins!

> [!NOTE] Sinus-cavernosus-thrombosis  
> Due to the anastomosis between the V. facialis and the V. ophthalmica, which drains into the cavernous sinus, bacterial inflammations focused on the facial skin or middle ear can be embolically transported intracranially, potentially triggering a cavernous sinus thrombosis. Special caution is advised in the area of the so-called "Danger Triangle" of the face; this refers to the triangular area between the corners of the mouth and the root of the nose. The cavernous sinus thrombosis is a cause of the cavernous sinus syndrome, which is characterized by the partial or complete loss of the cranial nerves that run in the wall of the cavernous sinus.

## Orbit

The eye is embedded in the bony orbit for protection. This is filled with fat and connective tissue, which forms a firm capsule (vagina bulbi or “Tenon’s capsule”) around the bulbus oculi. The orbit has a pyramidal structure and consists of seven different bones. Accordingly, it directly borders various neighboring structures. In the orbit – besides the bulbus oculi and the vagina bulbi – are the optic nerve, the six extraocular muscles, the lacrimal gland, vessels, and ducts. There are several bony openings for the entry and exit of these structures into the cavity.

### Important Terms

- Orbital entrance (Aditus orbitalis): Frontal opening of the orbit, which is surrounded by bony edges (Margo orbitalis)
    - Lower orbital rim (Margo infraorbitalis): Maxilla and Zygomatic bone
    - Upper orbital rim (margo supraorbitalis): Frontal bone
- Periorbita: Special periosteum (bone membrane) over the orbital bone with a special composition of collagen and elastic connective tissue fibers
- Vagina bulbi (Tenon capsule): The fat and connective tissue that fills the orbital cavity is formed into a tight capsule around the bulbus oculi. All nerves, muscles, and blood vessels that are meant to reach the eye pass through it.

### Bony Limitations

> [!NOTE]
> Bones of the Orbit: "Goats eat dandelions, rather rarely pure marmalade." (Zygomatic bone, Frontal bone, Lacrimal bone, Ethmoid bone, Sphenoid bone, Palatine bone, Maxilla)

> [!NOTE] Orbital floor fracture 
> The bony walls of the orbit are extremely thin in many places. Especially the orbital floor consists only of thin bony lamellae, which is why fractures can easily occur there due to trauma. The break forces orbital contents from the fracture gap into the maxillary sinus, which is why the term "blow-out fracture" is commonly used. Patients often complain of paresthesias, which are nonspecific sensations, in the area of the N. maxillaris, double vision, and a restriction of eye movement when looking upwards. Additionally, a monocle hematoma (periorbital hematoma on the upper and lower eyelid) may be present.

## Development

The eye is evolutionarily considered a part of the brain. This fact is noticeable, among other things, in that the nerve cells of the eye (particularly of the optic nerve and the retina) are surrounded by so-called oligodendrocytes. The oligodendrocytes only occur in the central nervous system; in all parts of the peripheral nervous system, however, the myelination of the nerves is carried out by the so-called Schwann cells. The eye develops from the ectoderm and the mesoderm. The development proceeds in various stages, starting from a simple groove, through a vesicle and a cup-shaped structure, to the differentiated eye.

### General

- Origin of the eye material
    - Ectoderm
        - Neuroectoderm: Retina, Ciliary epithelium, Iris epithelium, Iris muscles
        - Surface ectoderm: Anterior corneal epithelium
            - Ectodermal Placode : Eye Lens
    - Mesoderm: Inner layer of the Cornea, iris stroma, and Uvea
- Period: 3rd development week to 9th development month

### Development Steps

- 3.–5. Development Week
    - From the portion of the neural tube, from which the diencephalon later develops, two optic grooves (sulci optici) protrude.
    - With the conclusion of the neuroporus anterior, the eye grooves develop into eye vesicles.
    - The eye vesicles approach the surface ectoderm and thereby trigger the development of a lens placode.
    - Through cell proliferation, a lens pit develops from the lens placode
    - Induction of the eye blisters and formation into a double-walled eye cup with eye cup stem
    - In the course of development, the inner layer of the eye cup forms the nervous layer of the retina and the outer layer forms the pigment epithelium.
    - The edges of the lens pits grow toward each other and form the lens vesicles.
- 5th–8th week of development
    - A groove forms on the underside of the eye cup stem - the so-called eye cup slit.
    - Differentiation of the optic cup stalk to N. opticus
    - Development of the A. and V. hyaloidea in the eye cup fissure with progression to the eye cup
    - The lens vesicle detaches from the surface ectoderm and shifts to the eye cup
    - End of the eye cup fissure → A. and V. hyaloidea now run in the optic nerve
- 2nd–3rd month of development
    - From the mesenchyme that surrounds the eye cup, the choroid, the sclera, and the cornea are formed.
    - Formation of the eyelids
    - Formation of the vitreous body
- 7th–9th month of development
    - Obliteration of the A. and V. hyaloidea in the eye cup and differentiation in the proximal section to the A. centralis retinae
    - Formation of the pupil

> [!NOTE]
> The eyelids are still fused together after their formation and only separate from each other in the 6th to 7th month!

> [!NOTE] Kolobom
> Normally, the ocular cup cleft closes in the 7th week of development. If this does not occur or occurs incorrectly, a complete or partial cleft can extend through the iris, lens, choroid, and optic nerve. This cleft is referred to as "coloboma." A coloboma is based on a genetic disorder and can occur sporadically or be inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner.

> [!NOTE] Anophthalmia
> A complete absence of one or both bulbs along with the corresponding N. opticus is called anophthalmia. This rare developmental disorder can be the result of a lack of development of the eye vesicle (primary anophthalmia) or an intrauterine injury (secondary anophthalmia).

> [!NOTE] Retinal Detachment
> Since the inner, neurosensory layer and the pigment epithelium of the retina originate from different layers of the eye cup from the neuroectoderm, the retina is not so firmly attached here and can detach, for example, through holes or tears in the retina after a vitreous detachment. A retinal detachment is an ophthalmic emergency and requires prompt surgical intervention.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Eye and Orbit
### Eyeball

What is the so-called blind spot and at what height in the field of vision is it located?
- The blind spot is a bilateral, physiological visual field defect caused by the exit of the optic nerve (N. opticus). It is located temporally at about 15°.
What is meant by visual acuity and what visual acuity does a normally sighted person have?
- Visual acuity (Visus) describes the resolving power of the eye and is defined as Visus = 1/arcminute (α). A normally sighted person has a visual acuity of 1. This means they can resolve a visual angle of one arcminute.
What is the main composition of the substantia propria of the cornea?
- The substantia propria of the cornea consists mainly of water and collagen.
The zonule fibers of the lens are composed of which structure, and in which condition does this become noticeable?
- The zonule fibers of the lens are mostly composed of fibrillin-1. For this reason, lens dislocation often occurs in Marfan syndrome (an autosomal dominant inherited mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene).
What are the components of the middle layer of the eye (Tunica vasculosa bulbi)?
- The components of the middle layer of the eye (Tunica vasculosa bulbi) are the iris with the sphincter and dilator pupillae muscles, the choroid, and the ciliary body with the ciliary muscle.
The pars optica of the retina consists of two layers, and how are they structured?
- The pars optica of the retina consists of the stratum pigmentosum, a single-layered isoprismatic pigment epithelium, and the stratum nervosum, which in turn consists of nine layers and contains the first three neurons of the visual pathway (1. photoreceptor cells, 2. bipolar cells, 3. ganglion cells).
Through which structure of the eye is the aqueous humor produced?
- The aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary body.
Through which cells is the aqueous humor secreted?
- The aqueous humor is secreted by the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body.
What function does the Schlemm canal have?
- The Schlemm canal collects aqueous humor from the anterior chamber and drains it into the scleral and episcleral veins.
The inhibition of which enzyme leads to a decrease in aqueous humor production?
- Aqueous humor production can be reduced by inhibition of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.
What structures does the vitreous body border?
- The vitreous body fills the space between the lens, ciliary body, and retina.
### Tear Apparatus

Through which stations does the tear fluid travel from the lacrimal lake to the inferior nasal meatus?
- After the tear fluid has collected in the lacrimal lake (Lacus lacrimalis), it is funneled through the lacrimal puncta in the upper and lower eyelids via the lacrimal canaliculi into the lacrimal sac (Saccus lacrimalis) and finally through the nasolacrimal duct (Ductus nasolacrimalis) into the inferior nasal meatus (Meatus nasi inferior).
How can the location of the lacrimal gland (Glandula lacrimalis) be described?
- The lacrimal gland is located in the fossa for the lacrimal gland (Fossa glandulae lacrimalis) of the frontal bone (Os frontale) above the lateral canthus.
### Eyelids

What components make up the eyelid?
- The eyelid mostly consists of the orbicularis oculi muscle (M. orbicularis oculi), the tarsus, and the Meibomian glands, which are surrounded by the Riolan muscle.
What type of gland is the Meibomian gland of the eyelid and what is its function?
- The Meibomian gland is a sebaceous gland. It produces a lipid- and protein-rich secretion that serves to maintain the tear film.
What is the tarsus of the eyelid made of?
- The tarsus of the eyelid is a reinforcing plate made of collagenous connective tissue. It also contains sebaceous glands—the so-called Meibomian glands.
### Muscles of the Eye

What functions do the contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscle have, and how is it innervated?
- When the ciliary muscle contracts, the zonule fibers relax, causing the lens curvature (and thus the refractive power) to increase—this is near accommodation. When the ciliary muscle relaxes, the zonule fibers tighten, causing the lens curvature (and thus the refractive power) to decrease—this is distance accommodation. The ciliary muscle is innervated by parasympathetic fibers.
Which eye muscle originates as the only one not from the tendinous ring? Where does it originate instead?
- The inferior oblique muscle (M. obliquus inferior) is the only eye muscle that does not originate from the tendinous ring (Anulus tendineus) but instead from the medial orbital wall.
Which muscles regulate the size of the pupils and how are they innervated?
- The dilator pupillae muscle (M. dilatator pupillae) is responsible for dilating the pupil (mydriasis) and is activated by the sympathetic nervous system. The sphincter pupillae muscle (M. sphincter pupillae) causes constriction of the pupil (miosis) and is innervated by parasympathetic fibers.
Which active substance causes constriction of the pupils (miosis)?
- Pupil constriction (miosis) can be induced by cholinesterase inhibitors.
What is a ptosis and how does it occur?
- Ptosis describes the drooping of the upper eyelid. It is usually caused by paralysis of the superior tarsal muscle (M. tarsalis superior).
What is special about the course of the M. obliquus superior?
- The superior oblique muscle (M. obliquus superior) does not run directly to the eyeball (Bulbus oculi). It uses the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle (Trochlea musculi obliqui superioris) at the medial orbital margin as a pulley (hypomochlion) and is redirected there.
Which extraocular muscles are innervated by the R. inferior of the oculomotor nerve?
- The inferior branch (R. inferior) of the oculomotor nerve (N. oculomotorius) innervates three eye muscles: inferior rectus (M. rectus inferior), medial rectus (M. rectus medialis), and inferior oblique (M. obliquus inferior).
Through which nerve is the M. obliquus superior innervated? What does paralysis of the muscle lead to?
- The superior oblique muscle (M. obliquus superior) is innervated by the trochlear nerve (N. trochlearis). Since this muscle is responsible for downward movement of the eye, paralysis leads to double vision (diplopia) when attempting to look downward.
Which muscles belong to the straight eye muscles and what are their main functions?
- The straight eye muscles include the superior rectus (M. rectus superior) — elevation of gaze, inferior rectus (M. rectus inferior) — depression of gaze, medial rectus (M. rectus medialis) — rotation of the eye medially, and lateral rectus (M. rectus lateralis) — rotation of the eye laterally.
What is the main symptom of paralysis of an external eye muscle and how does it occur?
- Paralysis of an external eye muscle (e.g., as part of a cranial nerve syndrome) manifests as double vision (diplopia). This is caused by "paralytic strabismus": if the patient tries to move the paralyzed eye muscle, movement is only possible on the unaffected side, and the gaze axes of both eyes no longer align.
### Vascular Supply

Which structures pass through the optic canal?
- The optic nerve (N. opticus) and the ophthalmic artery (A. ophthalmica) pass through the optic canal (Canalis opticus).
### Orbita

Which structures pass through the superior orbital fissure?
- Through the superior orbital fissure (Fissura orbitalis superior), within the tendinous ring (Anulus tendineus), run the nasociliary nerve (N. nasociliaris), the oculomotor nerve (N. oculomotorius), and the abducens nerve (N. abducens). Outside the tendinous ring, the frontal nerve (N. frontalis), lacrimal nerve (N. lacrimalis), trochlear nerve (N. trochlearis), and superior ophthalmic vein (V. ophthalmica superior) pass.
Which structures pass through the inferior orbital fissure?
- The infraorbital nerve (N. infraorbitalis), the zygomatic nerve (N. zygomaticus), as well as the infraorbital artery and vein (A. und V. infraorbitalis), and the inferior ophthalmic vein (V. ophthalmica inferior) pass through the inferior orbital fissure (Fissura orbitalis inferior).
### Development

From which germ layers do the various structures of the eye develop?
- The inner layer of the cornea, iris stroma, and uvea develop from mesoderm. The remaining eye structures develop from ectoderm, which can be subdivided into neuroectoderm (→ retina, ciliary epithelium, iris epithelium, iris muscles) and surface ectoderm (→ anterior corneal epithelium and lens).
