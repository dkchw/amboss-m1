# Overview Nutrition (Preclinical)
## Summary

A healthy and balanced diet is important to meet the body's daily energy needs and to provide it with vital substances. The body's sources of energy are carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Other important dietary components include, for example, water, vitamins, and minerals. The energy requirement depends on many different factors, which is why the recommended dietary composition varies depending on gender, physical activity, health status, etc. Nutrition is regulated by various transmitters and regulatory centers in the brain; however, due to various causes, it can still lead to malnutrition or overnutrition.

## Nutrients

The food consists of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and water.

### Non-essential Nutrients

Non-essential nutrients can be synthesized by the body to a small extent.

- Carbohydrates
- Protein
- Lipid
- Dietary fibers
- Water

### Essential Nutrients

Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized by the body itself.

- Vitamin
- Mineral substances
    - Trace elements (e.g. cobalt, iron, iodine, copper, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, silicon, and zinc)
    - Macroelements (e.g. Calcium, Chlorine, Potassium, Magnesium, Sodium, Phosphorus, and Sulfur)
- Some fatty acids (linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid)
- Some amino acids (Valine, Leucine, Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Tryptophan, Methionine, Threonine, and Lysine)

### Function and Need of Nutritional Components

#### Energy Suppliers

Through the breakdown of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, energy is generated that can be used in the respiratory chain for the synthesis of ATP.

|Function|Daily Requirement|Sources|Relevant Chapters|
|---|---|---|---|
|Carbohydrates|   |   ||
|- Main energy suppliers of the cell<br>    <br>    - Obligate glucose users: Nervous tissue, kidney medulla, and erythrocytes rely on the supply of carbohydrates|- About 55–60% of energy needs should be covered by carbohydrates|- For example, sugar or grains|- Carbohydrates<br>- Breakdown and synthesis of glucose<br>- Glycogen metabolism|
|Protein|   |   ||
|- Energy suppliers<br>- Supply of essential substances<br>    - Essential amino acids<br>    - Inorganic nitrogen compounds (e.g., ammonia)|- About 10–15% of energy needs<br>- Balance minimum: 30–40 g<br>- Optimum: 1 g/kg body weight|- For example, meat, dairy products, or legumes|- Amino acids and proteins<br>- Amino acid metabolism|
|Lipids|   |   ||
|- Energy suppliers<br>- Absorption of fat-soluble vitamins|- No more than 25-30% of energy needs should be covered by lipids<br>- Some fatty acids are essential and must be supplied to the body daily|- Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid: Plant oils and fish|- Lipids|

> [!NOTE]
> Carbohydrates are the most important energy suppliers of the cell!

#### Dietary Fiber

Dietary fiber is a plant-based food component that cannot be digested in the small intestine. It usually consists of indigestible carbohydrates such as cellulose, pectins, or chitin.

|Function|Daily Requirement|Sources|
|---|---|---|
|- Promotion of satiety<br>- Reduction of blood sugar levels<br>- Decrease in cholesterol absorption<br>- Reduction of stool transit time through the colon|- At least 30 g|- Whole grains<br>- Fruits<br>- Vegetables<br>- Legumes|

### Isodynamics of Nutrients

When considering food intake purely as energy extraction, that is, the extraction of electrons for the respiratory chain, only carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins play a role as food components. Through their combustion, electrons are obtained, which are converted into ATP within the context of the respiratory chain. In this case, it does not matter from which of the three food components the electron was obtained; they are thus interchangeable in terms of energy production (= Isodynamy of food substances).

### Biological Value of Proteins

Proteins are made up of various amino acid patterns. The more the amino acid composition resembles the amino acid requirements of the body, the higher the so-called biological value of the protein. It describes how well ingested proteins can be converted into body proteins. Since proteins are the primary source of nitrogen for the body, the biological value can be calculated based on nitrogen intake and excretion.

- Biological value = Nitrogen that remains in the body / Nitrogen that was absorbed through food × 100
    - Unit: Mostly Percent

## Regulation of Food and Fluid Intake

### Regulation of Food Intake

For the regulation of food intake, the feelings of "hunger" and "satiety" are of significant importance, as they help maintain body weight within a healthy range. There are regulatory centers in the hypothalamus and the medulla oblongata that control food intake through feedback loops. A distinction is made between short-term and long-term regulation.

- Regulatory centers
    - Hypothalamus
        - Hunger Center: Lateral Hypothalamic Fields and Perifornical Region
            - Hormone: Orexin and MCH (Melanin-Concentrating Hormone)
        - Satiety Center: Ncl. ventromedialis and Ncl. paraventricularis
            - Hormone: Oxytocin, CRH (Corticotropin-releasing hormone) and TRH (Thyrotropin-releasing hormone)
        - Ncl. arcuatus: Receives information from the body periphery and stimulates the hunger or satiety center.
            - Hormone
                - α-MSH (α-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone): Stimulates the satiety center
                - NPY (Neuropeptide Y), AgRP (Agouti-related Peptide): Stimulate the hunger center
    - Medulla oblongata: Nucleus of the solitary tract
        - Integration and further processing of efferences from the hunger and satiety center as well as the body periphery (mechanical and chemical stimuli)

#### Short-term regulation

The short-term regulation of food intake occurs through mechanical and chemical stimuli from the gastrointestinal tract.

- Mechanical stimuli: Food-induced stretching of the stomach and small intestine
    - Registration: Mechanosensors of the stomach and small intestine wall
    - Forwarding
        - About vagal afferents to the Ncl. tractus solitarius
        - About sympathetic afferents to the hypothalamus with inhibition of the neurons of the hunger center via β-adrenergic receptors when the stomach is full.
    - Mediation: Feeling of fullness
- Chemical stimuli: Nutritional components or mediators released by them as chemical signals
    - Increase in blood sugar levels
        - Stimulation of the neurons in the satiety center
        - Inhibition of the orexin neurons in the hunger center
    - CCK (Cholecystokinin)
        - CCK is secreted by the enteroendocrine I-cells of the small intestine after they come into contact with food components. The main stimulus for CCK release is the contact of the I-cells with free fatty acids.
        - Inhibits hunger via the Ncll. tractus solitarii
    - PYY (Neuropeptide YY)
        - Inhibits the NPY (Neuropeptide Y) and AgRP (Agouti-related Peptide) neurons in the arcuate nucleus and thus inhibits hunger.
        - Inhibits hunger directly via the Ncll. solitary tract.
    - GLP1 (Glucagon-like peptide 1)
        - Inhibits hunger directly via the Ncll. solitary tract.
    - Ghrelin: Ghrelin is the first discovered hunger hormone and is released from endocrine cells in the stomach. Its release decreases with food intake.
        - Excites the NPY (Neuropeptide Y) and AgRP (Agouti-related Peptide) neurons in the arcuate nucleus, which in turn activate neurons of the hunger center.

> [!NOTE]
> Ghrelin is the first discovered hunger hormone!

#### Long-term regulation

The adipose tissue is the body's largest energy reserve. Therefore, the long-term regulation of body weight occurs through the regulation of the body's fat mass with the help of the hormones leptin and insulin.

- Hormones of long-term regulation
    - Leptin
        - Synthesis site: White adipose tissue
        - Site of action: Leptin receptors in the arcuate nucleus
    - Insulin
        - Synthesis site: Beta cells of the Langerhans islets of the pancreas
        - Site of action: Insulin receptors in the arcuate nucleus.
- Central effect of hormones: Transition from an anabolic to a catabolic metabolic state.
    - Stimulation of the leptin and insulin receptors in the arcuate nucleus
        - Release of α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) → Stimulation of neurons in the satiety center → The transmitters of the satiety center, oxytocin, TRH, and CRH, inhibit food intake via the Ncl. tractus solitarii.
        - Direct inhibition of the hunger center by binding of α-MSH to the melanocortin receptor-4
    - Inhibition of NPY and AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus → Inhibition of orexin and MCH neurons in the hunger center → Inhibition of the feeling of hunger

> [!NOTE] Overweight
> There are various genetic defects that can lead to or promote overweight. Examples of this are defects in the genes for the leptin or melanocortin receptor. However, defects in these genes are very rare and are responsible for overweight in very few cases. The development of overweight is generally multifactorial. In addition to genetic causes, poor eating habits, insufficient exercise, and misregulated metabolic processes can also contribute to this.

## Inadequate Nutrition

An inadequate diet can be both undernutrition and overnutrition. While undernutrition in the Western world is mainly caused by mental illnesses (e.g., bulimia, anorexia nervosa) or diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., Crohn's disease), the cause of overnutrition is usually a long-term increased energy intake combined with a lack of physical activity. Possible over- or undernutrition can be assessed using the Body Mass Index (BMI). Other methods to estimate nutritional status include the Waist-to-Hip Ratio (the ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference) as well as waist circumference, which is also a diagnostic criterion for metabolic syndrome. Particularly at lower BMI, the predictive power of the Waist-to-Hip Ratio regarding mortality risk is higher than that of the BMI. The underlying idea is that the distribution of body fat has an impact on metabolism; especially visceral fat is hormonally active and negatively influences mortality.

### Body Mass Index

## Parenteral Nutrition

Parenteral nutrition is an artificial form of nutrition that bypasses the gastrointestinal tract. It is used for patients who can no longer be adequately nourished orally or through a feeding tube (e.g., in cases of esophageal cancer). It is usually administered via access to a large body vein (e.g., superior vena cava). Since it involves a special solution that contains all essential nutrients, parenteral nutrition can be maintained over a long period if necessary.

- Supplied nutrients
    - Water
    - Glucose
    - Amino acids
    - Lipid
    - Vitamin
    - Minerals

## Review Questions for the Chapter Overview of Nutrition
### Nutrients

What does the biological value of a protein indicate?
- The biological value of a protein describes how well ingested proteins can be converted into the body's own proteins. It is higher the more the amino acid composition of the protein resembles the amino acid requirements of the body.

What are dietary fibers and what functions do they have?
- Dietary fibers are plant-based food components that cannot be digested in the small intestine. Among other things, they promote a feeling of fullness, reduce blood sugar levels, decrease cholesterol absorption, and shorten the transit time of stool in the colon (by increasing volume and softening the stool).

### Regulation of Food and Fluid Intake

How does short-term regulation of food intake occur?
- Short-term regulation of food intake occurs through mechanical stimuli (stretching of the stomach and small intestine) and chemical stimuli (hormones released in the gastrointestinal tract, rise in blood sugar).

How do ghrelin and GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1) affect feelings of hunger and satiety?
- Ghrelin belongs to the "hunger hormones" and stimulates appetite by activating neurons in the hunger center. GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 1) is a peptide hormone with several effects, among them involvement in the generation of the feeling of satiety.

What is leptin? Describe its mechanism of action!
- Leptin is an appetite-suppressing hormone produced in white adipose tissue, which is also involved in the long-term regulation of body weight. It binds to specific leptin receptors in the arcuate nucleus (hypothalamus). This causes the release of α-MSH (α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), which in turn mediates appetite suppression. Additionally, the release of NPY (Neuropeptide Y) and AgRP (Agouti-Related Peptide) is inhibited, which also reduces the feeling of hunger.
