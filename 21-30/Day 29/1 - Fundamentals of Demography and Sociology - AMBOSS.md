# Fundamentals of Demography and Sociology
## Summary

Demography as the study of populations describes the current state as well as the development of a population. The following factors will be presented that describe the state of a population and shape and influence its development. For example, the birth and death rates as well as the immigration and emigration of people influence a population. In Germany, the declining birth rate and the steadily improving medical care lead to an increasingly aging population. In addition to the development of the population, the structure within a society is also important. Sociology, as the study of the structure of a society, describes, for example, the various sectors of employment as well as differences regarding class affiliation within a society.
## Demographics and Demographic Transformation

Demography, as the study of population, will be examined in the following sections. The development of the population is dependent on the birth and death rate as well as immigration and emigration.

### Basic Concepts of Demography

- General fertility rate (general fertility rate): Number of live births within a year in relation to women of childbearing age
- Net reproduction rate: Number of live-born girls in relation to women of childbearing age
- Nuptiality (Marriage Rate): Number of married couples in a population group
- Natality (general birth rate): Number of live births within a year per 1,000 inhabitants.
- Mortality (death rate): Number of deaths in a specific period related to a population group
- Letalität: Verhältnis von Anzahl der Todesfälle zur Anzahl aller Erkrankten bezogen auf eine Krankheit
- Old-age dependency ratio: ratio of (old-age) pension recipients (e.g., individuals aged approximately 65 and older) to employed individuals (e.g., individuals aged approximately between 20 and 65).
- Age dependency ratio (Burden ratio): The ratio of presumably non-working age groups (such as individuals under 20 years or over 65 years) to a presumably largely employable age group (such as individuals between approximately 20 and 65 years).

### Demographic Transformation (Phase Model of the Demographic Transition)

The schema of demographic transformation illustrates the development of a society in terms of birth and death rates throughout its industrialization. The model was developed from the data of Western nations during the course of industrialization and is applicable to other societies in certain aspects.

- 1. Pre-transformative (pre-industrial) phase
    - Slow population growth due to high infant mortality combined with a high birth rate
- 2. Early Transformational (Early Industrial) Phase
    - Increase in population growth due to a decline in infant mortality with a consistently high birth rate
- 3. Transformation phase (turnaround phase)
    - Population growth reaches its peak
    - In the further course of time, a gradual decline in the birth rate and a beginning decrease in population growth.
- 4. Late Transformational Phase
    - Schnelle Abnahme des Bevölkerungswachstums bedingt durch weitere Abnahme der Geburtenrate
- 5. Post-transformation phase
    - Slowly declining, steadily stable population growth with consistently low birth and death rates
- Zweiter demografischer Übergang
    - Further decline in the birth rate, so that society would become smaller without immigration.

### Demographic Change in Germany

- Demographic aging: Caused by an increasingly aging population with a declining birth rate.
- Compression of morbidity: In addition to the increasing average life expectancy, the time of life in which a person is healthy is also increasing.
- Medicalization thesis: As people age, the likelihood of many diseases increases: Since the population is getting older, they spend more time in illness, and the increase in life expectancy is essentially "purchased" through rising healthcare costs.

### Main Causes of Death in Germany

- Women: Diseases of the heart cardiovascular system
- Men: Diseases of the heart circulatory system and lung and bronchial cancer

> [!NOTE]
> The main causes of death in Western cultures are no longer infectious, acute diseases, but increasingly chronic and mental illnesses (non-communicable diseases)! This transition is referred to as epidemiological transition. According to WHO, four behavioral risk factors are largely responsible for this: tobacco smoking, harmful alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet.

### Migration und Akkulturation

- Migration: Permanent change of residence by people.
    - Healthy Migrant Effect: Phänomen, dass die migrierte Bevölkerung im Vergleich zur nicht-migrierten Bevölkerung überdurchschnittlich gesund ist
- Acculturation: The process of integrating into a society and its culture.
    - Integration (Sociology): Occurs when an individual assimilates into the new culture but still retains their original culture.
    - Assimilation (Soziologie): Erfolgt, wenn sich ein Individuum vollständig an die neue Kultur anpasst und seine alte Kultur aufgibt
    - Separation (Soziologie): Beschreibt einen Zustand, in welchem aufgrund der Bestrebungen einer bestimmten Einwanderungsgruppe kein oder nur geringfügiger Kontakt zur Mehrheitsgesellschaft besteht (z.B. Festhalten an kulturellen Lebensweisen und Traditionen)
    - Marginalisierung: Erfolgt, wenn ein Individuum weder an seiner eigenen, ursprünglichen Kultur festhält, noch Kontakt zu der neuen Kultur besteht
## Structure of Society

In the following section, the various economic sectors and social class affiliations within a society are addressed. Social class affiliation depends on various status characteristics and is not necessarily constant within a generation or an individual. Additionally, social class affiliation influences health and illness behavior.

### Änderungen der Erwerbsstruktur

One distinguishes between three sectors of employment. According to Fourastié's tertiarization hypothesis, over time, employment in the first two sectors will decrease significantly compared to employment in the tertiary sector. This is because the activities of the first two sectors can be replaced by machines within the framework of increased mechanization, whereas the activities of the tertiary sector are less likely to be replaced.

- Primärer Sektor: Urproduktion
- Sekundärer Sektor: Güterverarbeitung
- Tertiary Sector: Services and Trade

### Soziale Schicht

Die sog. meritokratische Triade hilft dabei zu ermitteln, in welcher Schicht sich ein Individuum befindet. Sie setzt sich aus folgenden drei Statusmerkmalen zusammen. Je besser ein Individuum ausgebildet, je angesehener sein Beruf und je höher sein Einkommen ist, desto höher ist die soziale Schicht, in der er sich befindet.

- Training
- Profession
- Income

#### Layer indices

- Serve to compare different groups or members of society in terms of their social status.
- Are calculated for the members of a society based on individually selected status characteristics (e.g., education, profession, income) or based on their manifestation.
- If multiple status characteristics are used to calculate the layer index, it is referred to as a multiple layer index.

#### Mittelschichtspezifische Werte

With the social class, typical values and normative attitudes are associated. The so-called "middle class" is attributed the following attributes:

- Zukunftsorientierung
- Need postponement
- Self-determination
- Erfolgs- und Aufstiegsorientierung
- Confidence regarding the influence on one's own social status

#### Status consistency and Status inconsistency

- Statuskonsistenz (Statuskongruenz, Statuskristallisation): Besteht, wenn sich eine Person bezüglich der einzelnen Statusmerkmale jeweils auf der gleichen Ebene befindet
- Statusinkonsistenz (Statusinkongruenz): Besteht, wenn sich eine Person bezüglich der einzelnen Statusmerkmale nicht jeweils auf der gleichen Ebene befindet

#### Social Mobility

Unter sozialer Mobilität versteht man die Änderung der sozialen Position, dabei werden verschiedene Dimensionen unterschieden. Die Wichtigsten sind die horizontale oder vertikale Mobilität sowie die Intra- oder Intergenerationenmobilität.

- Vertikale Mobilität: Veränderung des sozialen Status mit Übergang von einer sozialen Schicht in eine andere. Dies kann selbstverständlich sowohl einen sozialen Aufstieg als auch einen sozialen Abstieg bedeuten.
- Horizontal mobility: Change of a status characteristic without altering the class affiliation.
- Intragenerational mobility: Change in social status within a generation over the course of a person's life
- Intergenerationenmobilität: Veränderung des sozialen Status zwischen zwei oder mehr Generationen

#### Social Opportunity Structure

- Definition: Describes the access opportunities to various resources (e.g., education, work) in a society.
- Bedeutung: Nicht jedes Mitglied der Gesellschaft hat den gleichen Zugriff auf materielle (z.B. Geld, Wohnraum, Kleidung) und immaterielle (z.B. ärztliche Versorgung, Pflegeleistungen) Ressourcen

#### Deprivation

Deprivation bedeutet zunächst einmal Mangel oder Verlust. Je nachdem, worauf sich dieser Mangel bezieht, unterscheidet man verschiedene Formen der Deprivation.

##### Relative Deprivation

- Definition: Exists when an individual or a social group feels disadvantaged in comparison to other individuals or social groups.
- Example: Someone who has been promoted might feel dissatisfied with the extent of their promotion in comparison ("relatively") to other promoted individuals, instead of comparing themselves to significantly disadvantaged employees and evaluating their promotion positively.

##### Structural Deprivation

- Definition: Exists when an individual or a group of people have fewer opportunities to participate in society than others.
- Example: In socially disadvantaged neighborhoods, there is often a poorer infrastructure and a lower cultural offer.

> [!NOTE]
> Ein Indikator für Deprivation ist die Einkommensungleichheit: Wer wenig verdient, hat im Vergleich zu Besserverdienenden weniger Möglichkeiten auf gesellschaftliche Teilhabe!

#### Pear

- Absolute poverty: Satisfaction of basic needs (e.g., food, housing) is not possible for material or financial reasons.
- Relative Armut: Bezieht sich auf das soziale Umfeld eines Menschen und somit auf soziale Ungleichheit

#### Gini-Koeffizient

- Value between 0 and 1 that can be used as a measure of inequality in a society.
- For example, it is used to assess the income distribution in societies.
- 0 = gleichmäßige Verteilung (Einkommensgleichheit)
- 1 = maximal uneven distribution (income inequality)
- Je höher der Gini-Koeffizient, desto ungleicher die Verteilung

#### The Concept of Class According to Karl Marx

- Karl Marx describes two classes of capitalist society.
    - The bourgeoisie/capitalists (the wealthy class)
    - The proletariat (the propertyless working class)
- Die Klassenzugehörigkeit hängt dabei vom Besitz bzw. der Verfügung über Produktionsmittel ab
## Health and Illness in Different Social Classes

Das Gesundheits- und Krankheitsverhalten ist in den verschiedenen sozialen Schichten unterschiedlich ausgeprägt (= sozialer Gradient). So zeigen Personen aus unteren Schichten tendenziell ein „stärkeres“ gesundheitsgefährdendes Verhalten als Personen aus höheren Schichten, was wiederum ein höheres Mortalitätsrisiko in den niedrigeren Schichten bedingt (= sozialer Gradient der Mortalität). Es besteht häufig ein inverser Zusammenhang zwischen dem Sozialstatus und dem Erkrankungsrisiko. Ein weiterer Unterschied bezieht sich auf die Inanspruchnahme von Naturheilmitteln. Diese werden häufiger von Personen aus höheren Schichten angewendet.

### Causation Hypothesis vs. Drift Hypothesis

- Causation hypothesis: According to this hypothesis, the unequal distribution of health and illness between the various social classes is caused by higher burdens and more health-endangering behaviors of the lower classes.
    - Beispiele
        - Schlechtere Wohnverhältnisse
        - Higher workload
        - Unfavorable health behavior
        - Ungünstiges Krankheitsverhalten
- Social Drift Hypothesis: According to this hypothesis, illnesses can lead to social inequality. If an individual becomes ill, for example, with a psychiatric disorder, this could result in a social decline into a lower social class.

> [!NOTE] Ecological Studies  
> Die Untersuchung des Zusammenhangs zwischen Risikofaktoren (z.B. der Einkommensungleichheit) und Erkrankungen ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil epidemiologischer Forschung. In sogenannten „ökologischen Studien“ werden Daten aus der zu untersuchenden Bevölkerungsgruppe gesammelt (sog. „Aggregatdaten“), welche dann ins Verhältnis zu bspw. der Erkrankungshäufigkeit gesetzt werden.

> [!NOTE] Excursus: Quantitative and Qualitative Social Research
> In the social sciences, a distinction is made between the more object-related quantitative social research and the more subject-related qualitative social research. Quantitative methods are preferably used to test hypotheses or causal relationships, and the numerical data is collected using standardized survey methods (e.g., questionnaires with predefined answer options) from as large sample sizes as possible. In contrast, the goal of qualitative social research is to understand and interpret the subjective perspective of the study participants. The data collection is predominantly non-standardized and flexible (e.g., in the context of group discussions or guideline-based expert interviews with open questions). The interpretive evaluation of qualitative data (e.g., through content or discourse analyses) is usually much more time-consuming than for numerical quantitative data. Depending on the research question, quantitative or qualitative methods or a combination of both are best suited.

### Different Occurrences of Diseases in Social Classes

Die meisten Krankheiten sind in unteren Schichten höher ausgeprägt als in oberen Schichten. Es gibt jedoch auch Beispiele für Krankheiten, die in höheren Schichten vermehrt vorkommen.

| |Beispiele für Krankheiten|
|---|---|
|Vorkommen vermehrt in unteren Schichten|Koronare Herzkrankheit, Herzinfarkt, Karies, Bronchialkarzinom, Diabetes mellitus, Schlaganfall, Herzinsuffizienz, Asthma bronchiale, Aids, Depressionen, Schizophrenie, Substanzmissbrauch|
|Occurrences are more frequent in upper layers|Allergies, Atopic Dermatitis, Anorexia Nervosa (Anorexia), Breast Cancer|
## Review Questions on the Chapter Fundamentals of Demography and Sociology
Demografie und demografische Transformation
*   The net reproduction rate refers to the number of healthy girls born in relation to the number of women of childbearing age. Only the mother and daughter generations are considered to estimate the reproductive capacity of a population based on the numerical ratio.

What does the net reproduction rate refer to?
*   The net reproduction rate refers to the number of healthy girls born in relation to the number of women of childbearing age. Only the mother and daughter generations are considered to estimate the reproductive capacity of a population based on the numerical ratio.

Define the term "Natality"!
*   Natality (= birth rate) indicates the number of births per 1,000 inhabitants in one year.

Definiere die Begriffe „Mortalität“ und „Letalität“!
*   Mortality (death rate) indicates the number of deaths within a certain period related to a population group. Different causes of death (e.g., all deaths or only deaths due to a specific disease) as well as different population groups (e.g., the total population or exclusively the female population of Germany) can be considered. Fatality applies this to a population of the diseased: it indicates the number of deaths due to a specific illness in relation to the number of those affected by that disease.

What does the old-age dependency ratio describe?
*   The old-age dependency ratio (also called age dependency ratio or burden ratio) describes the ratio of people of retirement age (e.g., ≥65 years) to people of working age (e.g., 20–64 years).

Was versteht man unter demografischem Altern?
*   The term "demographic aging" describes the increase in the average age of a population. In Germany, this is primarily caused by two factors: a higher life expectancy among older people combined with simultaneously declining birth rates. Furthermore, the ratio of immigration to emigration (migration) in a country or region can also influence the demographic aging of a society if this varies by age group.

What is meant by the so-called "compression of morbidity"?
*   The compression of morbidity describes the phenomenon that people nowadays not only live longer but also stay healthy longer. This results in an increase in healthy years and a compression (reduction) of years lived with illness. Among other reasons, this is due to an increase in health-promoting lifestyles.

Describe the 5-phase model of demographic transition!
*   The 5-phase model of demographic transition describes how population growth and composition in a society change over the course of its industrialization. The 1st phase (= pre-transformational or pre-industrial phase) is characterized by a high birth rate combined with a high death rate and thus low population growth. In the 2nd phase (= early transformational or early industrial phase), a rapid increase in population growth occurs due to a decline in the death rate while birth rates remain high. The lower mortality is due to an overall higher standard of living, better hygienic conditions, and medical progress and initially affects infant and child mortality in particular. In the 3rd phase (= transformational or turning phase), population growth reaches its peak. The higher survival probability of children and an ideal number of children changing under the influence of societal modernization processes finally lead to a sharp decline in birth rates and consequently a rapid decrease in population growth in the 4th phase (= late transformational phase). The 5th phase (= post-transformational phase) is ultimately characterized by consistently low birth and death rates, so that stable population growth is established during this phase.

Welche Erkrankungsgruppe verursacht die meisten Todesfälle in Deutschland? Gibt es Unterschiede bzgl. der Geschlechter?
*   In both genders, most deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart attack). Malignant tumors follow in second place, with lung and bronchial cancer still occurring more frequently in men than in women.

Was beschreibt der Begriff „epidemiologische Transition“?
*   This refers to a change in the morbidity structure during the societal development of modern states. As a result of changes in society and its health conditions (e.g., improved hygienic standards), the frequency of diseases and causes of death changes. In wealthy countries, chronic degenerative diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, cancer) have replaced infectious diseases as the primary cause of death.

What is meant by the term "migration"?
*   Migration describes the permanent change of residence by people and thus the immigration and emigration of persons in a society.

What is understood in migration research by the terms "assimilation," "integration," "separation," and "marginalization"?
*   Assimilation refers to the complete adaptation to the new culture after migration, including the loss of one's own cultural identity. In contrast, someone is considered integrated if they are embedded in the new culture but at the same time continue to maintain their original culture. Separation describes a state after migration involving consciously minimal adaptation to the new society while maintaining strong ties to the original culture. Marginalization refers to the loss of connection to the culture of origin while lacking integration into the new culture. This is associated with considerable psychosocial stress.

### Struktur der Gesellschaft
What three sectors of employment are there, and what is meant by the tertiarization of a society in this context?
*   According to the theory of Clark and Fourastié, there are a primary (agriculture), secondary (industry), and tertiary sector (services, e.g., medical activities). Welfare, measured by national income, increases continuously with the transition from the primary to the tertiary sector. Tertiarization thus refers to the shift from the secondary sector to the tertiary sector, i.e., from an industrial to a service society.

How can affiliation with a social class be determined, and what is meant by the meritocratic triad in this context?
*   Affiliation to a social class can be determined by so-called status indices. Selected, mostly multiple status characteristics are used for this. Of particular importance are the three status characteristics described by the meritocratic triad: education, occupation, and income. The better a person is educated, the more prestigious their occupation, and the higher their income, the higher their socioeconomic status.

What is meant by the terms “status consistency” and “status inconsistency”?
*   These two terms refer to the status characteristics of education, occupation, and income (meritocratic triad). If a person is on the same level regarding these three characteristics, it is called status consistency (also status congruence or status crystallization). If a person is not on the same level regarding these three characteristics, it is called status inconsistency or status incongruence (example: a sociologist who finds no employment in their learned profession and instead works as a taxi driver).

Was versteht man unter den Begriffen „vertikale Mobilität“, „Intragenerationenmobilität“ und „Intergenerationenmobilität“?
*   All three terms denote dimensions of social mobility. Vertical mobility refers to the change of social status with the transition from one social stratum to another. This change in social stratum can occur within a generation over the course of a person's life (= vertical intragenerational mobility) or between two or more generations (= vertical intergenerational mobility).

Was beschreibt der Begriff „soziale Opportunitätsstruktur“?
*   The social (societal) opportunity structure describes the different chances of access to resources available to a society (e.g., work, housing, education, medical care). These resources are not equally available to every member of a society but depend especially on socioeconomic status.

What is meant by relative and structural deprivation?
*   Generally, deprivation means a state of lack or loss as well as a feeling of disadvantage. Structural deprivation exists when an individual or group of people has fewer opportunities for participation in society than others and is thereby disadvantaged. For example, socially weaker residential areas often have poorer infrastructure as well as fewer cultural offerings. Relative deprivation exists when an individual or social group feels disadvantaged compared to other individuals or social groups. For instance, a nurse could feel disadvantaged relative to a senior physician due to their significantly lower salary despite a high workload.

Was beschreibt der Gini-Koeffizient?
*   The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure for representing social inequality, applied, for example, to income and wealth distributions. It can take values between 0 and 1. The higher the Gini coefficient, the higher the social inequality. The extremes of 0 and 1 are not normally reached in reality: a Gini coefficient of 0 means, for example, that all inhabitants of a country earn exactly the same amount. If a single person earns the entire income of the country, the coefficient is 1. In reality, the countries with the lowest income inequality currently have a value of about 0.25 and those with the highest income inequality about 0.7. Germany's Gini coefficient is currently about 0.29 (as of 2017).

Worin besteht bei Karl Marx Klassenbegriff der wesentliche Unterschied zwischen den beiden Klassen einer Gesellschaft?
*   According to Karl Marx, to which class a member of society belongs depends on their possession (or control over means of production). Thus, wealthy citizens or capitalists belong to the bourgeoisie, and the propertyless working class belongs to the proletariat.

### Health and Illness in the different social classes
What is the relationship between social status and general health risk?
*   There is usually an inverse relationship between social status and risk of illness, i.e., persons from lower social classes generally have a higher risk of illness than persons from higher social classes. This is also known as the social gradient of morbidity. However, there are diseases more frequent in higher classes, including allergies, neurodermatitis, and anorexia nervosa.

Beschreibe die Verursachungshypothese!
*   According to the causation hypothesis, the unequal distribution of health and disease between social classes is caused by higher burdens and more health-damaging behavior in lower classes. Examples include poorer living conditions, higher work strain, and less favorable health and illness behavior.

Beschreibe die Drifthypothese!
*   The drift hypothesis states that an illness itself can be the reason for social decline. An example is disability caused by illness leading to reduced income and status of the affected person and eventually their assignment to a lower social class.

What is meant by ecological studies?
*   Ecological studies are special epidemiological studies that use aggregated data from population groups to examine, for example, the association of certain risk factors (e.g., income inequality, noise exposure) with the disease frequency in these populations.
