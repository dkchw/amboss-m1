# Energy and Heat Management
## Summary

The nutrients supplied to the organism are gradually converted into lower-energy forms during metabolism. The energy released in the process is used by the body to form ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which plays a central role in all specific cellular activities. ATP is the universal energy carrier usable by every cell in the human body and is synthesized as part of cellular energy production. When considering the totality of cellular energy production processes, one speaks of the energy expenditure of the entire body. The amount of energy required depends on various factors: The basal metabolic rate, for example, is defined as the minimum energy needed by the body to maintain basic life processes such as circulation and breathing. This basal metabolic rate can be increased many times over during physical exertion.

The energy balance is closely related to the heat balance: With every energy generation process, energy is also released in the form of heat. This waste heat is the most significant mechanism for heat generation in the human body. The body temperature must be kept constant within narrow limits. If it deviates even slightly, many metabolic processes can no longer run optimally, and with greater deviations, they come to a complete standstill. The center for temperature regulation is located in the hypothalamus; it receives its information from temperature-sensitive neurons and can initiate a series of regulatory mechanisms when the temperature deviates from the set point. Skin circulation plays a special role in temperature regulation.
## Energy Balance

The energy metabolism of humans initially occurs at the cellular level. In physiology, however, the energy expenditure of the entire body is often considered, which corresponds to the total expenditure of all body cells.

### Efficiency

- Definition: Work always releases energy in the form of heat (the so-called waste heat). In humans, the efficiency describes what portion of the supplied energy can actually be used for physical performance. It ranges from 0 to 100%.
- Unit: None
- Normal value: During physical work, the efficiency is about 25%

### Energy-providing Nutritional Components and Caloric Value

The main energy carriers of our food are carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. They are absorbed by the body and either stored in the cells (anabolic situation) or gradually converted into forms with lower energy (catabolic situation). During breakdown, energy is released, which is primarily used for the formation of the organic, universal energy storage form ATP in the respiratory chain. The calorific values of the individual energy carriers indicate how much energy is released during the breakdown of a substance.

- Energy-providing nutritional components: carbohydrates, lipids and proteins
- Calorific value: A measure of the thermal energy stored in a substance (e.g., a glucose molecule) that can be released during the "combustion" of the substance.
    - Unit: kJ/g
    - Physiological calorific value: The energy that can actually be utilized by the human metabolism. This value is always slightly lower than the physical calorific value for the following reasons:
        - Incomplete digestion/absorption
        - Production of energy-rich metabolic end products
        - Transport, conversion, and storage of the nutritional components
    - Physical calorific value: The energy released during the complete breakdown of a substance.

> [!NOTE]
> Other nutrients such as alcohol are metabolized by the cells: The physiological caloric value of alcohol is 30 kJ/g!

### Energy Storage

If the body is supplied with more energy than it needs, it will create energy stores, initially in the form of glycogen, and then in the form of triglycerides (TAGs) in adipose tissue.

|Storage form|Storage location|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Triacylglycerols (TAGs)|- In adipose tissue|- By far the largest energy reserves in the body|
|Glycogen|- In the liver|- ⅓ of glycogen reserves<br>- Serve to maintain blood sugar levels even during fasting<br>- Are depleted after about 12–24 hours|
|- In the muscle|- ⅔ of glycogen stores<br>- Serve the muscle's own needs muscle|
|ATP|- In every cell|- Is used up after seconds to minutes|
### Energy Expenditure

The actual energy expenditure, namely the metabolism of the nutritional components as well as the formation of ATP, occurs at the cellular level. When considering the entirety of cellular energy production processes, the energy expenditure of the entire body is described.

- At the cellular level
    - Maintenance energy turnover: Amount of energy that the cell needs to maintain its structural integrity.
    - Standby revenue: Amount of energy that the cell needs to be in a state of readiness
    - Activity turnover: Amount of energy that the cell requires when it is actively performing its work
- On a physical level
    - Basal metabolic rate: Energy expenditure of the body under standardized conditions (in the morning, fasting, physical and mental rest, thermal neutrality). It describes the total energy consumption of every cell under the mentioned conditions.
        - Normal values: 4.2 kJ/(kg×h) (♂), 3.8 kJ/(kg×h) (♀)
    - Leisure energy expenditure: The energy expenditure of a person who does not engage in intense physical activity is approximately: 9600 kJ (♂) and 8400 kJ (♀) per day.
    - Work turnover: The energy turnover during physical work
        - For light physical work: About 2 kJ/(kg×h) in addition to the leisure expenditure
        - For heavy physical work: Up to 10 kJ/(kg×h) in addition to the leisure expenditure

#### Proportion of organs in basal metabolic rate

| Percentage of organs in Basal Metabolism |                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Organ                                    | Share of Basal Metabolism (%) |
| Musculature                              | Approx. 25                    |
| Liver                                    | Approx. 25                    |
| Brain                                    | Approx. 20                    |
| Heart                                    | Approx. 10                    |
| Kidneys                                  | Approx. 5–10                  |

### Calorimetry

- Definitions
    - General: Measurement of the amount of heat absorbed or released during physical, chemical, or biological processes
    - In physiology: Determination of the energy expenditure of an organism using heat output (direct calorimetry) or by measuring respiratory gases (indirect calorimetry)
- Forms
    - Direct calorimetry: Determination of the energy expenditure of an organism using the heat that the organism releases
        - Conclusions
            - Suitable only for measuring total energy expenditure over a longer period of time, not for measuring short-term changes.
            - Is hardly used anymore due to the inaccuracy and the complicated experimental setup.
        - Disadvantages
            - Time delay between the end of the heat-generating process and its capture
            - Missing specificity
            - High measurement effort
        - Procedure: The test subject is placed in a closed chamber (so-called calorimeter), and after a certain period of time, the warming of the room air in the chamber is measured. As explained above, this allows for conclusions to be drawn about the energy expenditure.
        - Basic considerations: All metabolic processes ultimately result in the release of heat. In order for the body temperature to remain constant, this heat must be dissipated externally. Therefore, the measurement of the released heat corresponds to a quantitative determination of metabolic activity and thus of the energy expenditure.
    - Indirect Calorimetry: Determination of the energy expenditure of an organism using the measurement of O2 uptake and CO2 release.
        - Basic consideration: During the metabolism of nutrients, O2 is consumed and CO2 is produced. Since the body has neither a significant O2 nor a CO2 reservoir, the O2 consumed during metabolism corresponds to the inhaled O2, and the CO2 produced during metabolism corresponds to the exhaled CO2. Based on two auxiliary quantities (Caloric Equivalent and Respiratory Quotient, see below), one can conclude the energy expenditure of the organism from the measured O2 and CO2 values.
        - Formula: Energy expenditure = (O2 uptake/min) × Caloric equivalent
        - Unit: kJ/min
        - Auxiliary variables
            - Caloric equivalent: The nutrients are oxidized during their metabolism to CO2. The energy value obtained from the oxidation of a specific nutrient per liter of oxygen is referred to as the caloric equivalent (values for individual nutrients see table)
                - Unit: kJ/L O2
                - Problem: To accurately determine the energy expenditure, the exact proportion of nutrients in the food must be known. This can be determined using the respiratory quotient. If this is not possible, an average value for the so-called mixed diet is used.
            - Respiratory Quotient (RQ): The ratio of CO2 output to O2 uptake
                - Basic consideration: Each nutrient has a specific RQ (see the table below). This is because the metabolism of different nutrients consumes and produces different amounts of O2 and CO2.
                - Formula: RQ = VCO2/VO2
                - Conclusion: If the RQ is known, the predominant nutrient can be inferred. With a normal mixed diet, it is approximately 0.82. With a higher RQ, the predominant nutrients are more likely to be carbohydrates, while with a lower RQ, they are more likely to be fats and proteins.
        - Calculation example (with an oxygen uptake of 300 mL/min and a normal mixed diet)
            - Formula: Energy expenditure = O2 uptake/min × caloric equivalent
            - Given:
                - O2 uptake = 300 mL/min = 0.3 L/min
                - Caloric Equivalent for mixed diet = 20 kJ/L O2
            - Sought: Energy expenditure in kJ/min
            - Invoice
                - Energy expenditure = 0.3 L O2/min × 20 kJ/L O2 = 6 kJ/min

## Heat Balance

The body temperature of an organism must be kept constant within narrow limits. Even small deviations in either direction can cause many metabolic processes to no longer function optimally. The thermal balance describes the mechanisms available to the body to regulate body temperature.

### Body Temperature

- Definitions
    - Core body temperature: The temperature inside the trunk and the skull is maintained constantly at around 36.5°C through a regulatory loop.
    - Body shell temperature: The temperature of the body shell is variable; it depends on the outside temperature.
- Body temperature throughout the day: Body temperature undergoes a circadian fluctuation of about 1°C.
    - Minimum: Around 4 a.m.
    - Maximum: Around 6 PM in the evening

### Regulation of Heat Balance (Thermoregulation)

- Regulatory center: The caudal hypothalamus (posterior hypothalamic area) serves as a "thermostat."
    - Process: Receives information from the temperature sensors, compares it with the target temperature, and initiates various mechanisms for heat generation or heat dissipation (see below)
- Temperature sensors
    - Central (= inner) temperature sensors: Temperature-sensitive neurons in the anterior hypothalamus (preoptic area), in the lower brainstem and in the spinal cord
    - Peripheral (= outer) temperature sensors: Thermosensors in the skin

> [!NOTE]
> The hormone progesterone causes an increase in the target temperature in the hypothalamus of about 0.5°C. With the help of this temperature increase, the date of the ovulation can be traced!

> [!NOTE] Temperature method for contraception
> The so-called basal temperature method for contraception is based on the temperature fluctuations that the female cycle undergoes. Each morning after waking up, the body temperature is measured and recorded (the so-called basal temperature). In the middle of the cycle, a three-day increase in basal temperature can be observed, which is due to ovulation. Since the egg remains fertilizable for only a few hours after ovulation, the days following the egg release until the start of the menstruation should be considered "infertile" and thus "safe" days. The first phase, on the other hand, from the start of the menstruation until the determined egg release, consists of "unsafe" days, during which, if there is no desire for children, additional contraceptive methods should be used. Compared to hormonal ovulation inhibitors, contraception using the temperature method is indeed less secure, but it also has significantly fewer side effects.

### Heat Generation, Heat Release and Heat Absorption

To maintain the set temperature, the organism has several regulatory mechanisms available.

#### Heat generation

The majority of heat in the organism is generated by the "waste heat" released during metabolic processes. When this is not sufficient, the following mechanisms come into play:

1. Increase muscle activity: Heat production through increased muscle activity is the most important mechanism for heat production in adults.
    - Arbitrary: For example, by walking around in the cold
    - Involuntary: Through muscle tremors
2. Tremor-free heat production: Heat production through lipolysis in brown adipose tissue, it plays a role especially in newborns.
    - Principle: Mitochondrial Thermogenesis

#### Heat release and heat absorption

|Mechanism|Principle|Examples|
|---|---|---|
|Conduction|- Heat exchange with objects that are in direct contact with the body|- When sitting on a chair, it warms up over time<br>- Holding a cup of hot tea warms the hand|
|Convection|- Heat transfer in a flowing fluid|- Heated blood is transported to the periphery with the blood flow<br>- The temperature difference between the skin surface (about 26°C) and the room temperature (e.g., 21°C) drives a thermal convection - the warmed air rises. However, the actual heat exchange at the contact surface is based on conduction|
|Thermal radiation|- Infrared radiation, exchanged between bodies and objects at different temperatures|- Release of heat to the walls of a room where one is present<br>- Absorption of heat, e.g., through heated natural stone|
|Evaporation (Evaporation)|- Water that evaporates from the surface of the body removes heat from the body.<br>- This is only possible if the partial pressure of water vapor on the skin is higher than that of the surrounding air. The partial pressure of water vapor on the skin is about 6.3 kPa.|- Sweating<br>- Heat loss due to wet clothing/wet hair|

> [!NOTE]
> At outdoor temperatures that are above body temperature, heat can only be dissipated through evaporation. However, this also depends on humidity: When the humidity is 100%, heat dissipation through evaporation is only possible up to an ambient temperature of 37°C!

> [!NOTE] Pathomechanism in fever
> In the case of fever, there is an increase in the setpoint temperature in the hypothalamus under the influence of so-called pyrogens. Pyrogens can be endogenous substances, such as the interleukin-1 released by leukocytes, or prostaglandin E2 (endogenous pyrogens), or exogenous substances, such as bacterial components (exogenous pyrogens). During a fever rise, one feels cold because the setpoint in the hypothalamus is suddenly higher than the core body temperature. To raise the body temperature, muscle shivering ("chills") occurs, and there is reduced blood flow to the skin (paleness). In contrast, during a fever decrease, the setpoint temperature in the hypothalamus falls again, the body is hotter than it should be and there is intense sweating and dilation of the skin vessels (reddened, moist skin).

#### Temperature regulation through skin circulation

The heat loss through convection and conduction is only possible because the blood flow transports heat from the body's core to the periphery. The blood circulation of the skin thus has a special regulatory function for body temperature. In cold conditions, blood flow to the skin is reduced, resulting in less heat being released, whereas in heat, the skin receives increased blood flow.

- Mechanisms
    - Sympathetic Nervous System
        - In cold: Increased sympathetic activity → Concentration of norepinephrine in blood↑ → Activation of α1-adrenergic receptors on blood vessels of the skin → Vasoconstriction → Skin blood flow↓ → Heat loss↓
        - In heat: Decreased sympathetic activity → Concentration of norepinephrine in the blood↓ → Decreased activation of α1-adrenergic receptors → Vasodilation → Increased skin blood flow↑ → Increased heat loss↑
    - Arteriovenous Anastomoses (AVA)
        - In cold: AVA are closed, blood can only flow through the capillary bed → heat release↓
        - In heat: AVA are open, blood flows through the AVA and through the capillaries, the surface for heat dissipation increases → heat dissipation↑
    - Countercurrent principle of arteries and veins
        - Principle
            - General: Two material streams are conducted past each other for the purpose of heat or mass exchange.
            - Regarding the blood: Arteries and veins run parallel to the periphery and can exchange heat in the process.
                - Arterial blood, flowing from the center to the periphery, is cooled by the venous blood flowing past it.
                - Venous blood, which flows from the periphery to the center, is warmed by the arterial blood
        - Benefits
            - In cold: Regulatory mechanisms constrict the blood vessels. This improves the heat exchange of the blood flowing past each other in accordance with the countercurrent principle, so that the heat remains in the body's core and only a small amount is lost in the periphery.
            - In heat: Through regulatory mechanisms, the vessels are dilated. The blood flowing past each other according to the countercurrent principle can now exchange heat less effectively. The arteries therefore carry more heat into the periphery.
    - Lewis reaction: Local protective reaction of the skin vessels in response to cold
        - Principle: Expansion of the blood vessels and thereby increasing blood circulation for a short moment at regular intervals

### Adaptation to Extreme Temperatures

There is only a relatively narrow temperature range in which we perceive the ambient temperature as comfortable. If the temperature deviates from this so-called neutral temperature, the body's regulatory mechanisms are activated. Long-term changes are also possible if one lives for an extended period in areas with extreme temperature conditions.

- Indifference temperature
    - Definition: The temperature range that we perceive as comfortable
    - Conditions: Dependent on the ambient temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the heat radiation, the clothing, and the activity

> [!NOTE]
> The indifference temperature is higher the more the heat dissipation is promoted! Since the heat dissipation in water is significantly stronger through conduction, one freezes faster in water than in air!

|Adjustment Reactions|Short-term|Long-term|
|---|---|---|
|Heat stress|- Dilation of the skin's blood vessels (see Temperature regulation through skin blood flow)<br>- Sweat production|- Sweat production already at lower temperatures<br>- At high temperatures, increase in basal metabolic rate due to active cooling mechanisms<br>- Different sweat composition: Electrolyte content↓ (hypotonic) → Blood plasma is then hypertonic in relation to that → Increased thirst sensation → Increased fluid intake → Plasma volume↑|
|Cold exposure|- Constriction of skin blood vessels (see Temperature regulation via skin blood flow)<br>- Activation of muscle shivering|- Shivering threshold decreases<br>- Increased basal metabolic rate and thus increased heat production|

## Review Questions on the Chapter Energy and Heat Balance
### Energy Balance

What does the efficiency describe in relation to the energy balance of the human body?
- The efficiency indicates how much of the invested energy is converted into physical performance (since a part of the energy is always lost as so-called waste heat). The ratio of energy expenditure to achieved performance is the efficiency.

Name the physiological caloric values of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and alcohol! What is the difference between physiological and physical caloric value, and with which nutrient are they equal?
- The physical caloric value denotes the energy released during the complete breakdown of a substance. The physiological caloric value, on the other hand, denotes the energy that can actually be utilized by human metabolism and is usually smaller than the physical caloric value. However, for lipids, the physiological caloric value corresponds to the physical caloric value with 38.9 kJ/g. The physiological caloric value of carbohydrates and proteins is 17.2 kJ/g each, while that of alcohol is even 30 kJ/g.

In what forms can the body store excess energy, and which of these forms has the largest share of energy stores?
- When the body is supplied with more energy than it requires, energy stores are created. Initially in the form of glycogen in the liver and muscles, then in the form of triacylglycerols in the adipose tissue. The latter represent by far the largest energy stores of the body. Additionally, ATP is stored in every body cell, but this is already used up after a few seconds to minutes.

Name exemplarily the share of some important organs in the total turnover of the body!
- The percentage share of the brain in the basal metabolic rate is 20%, only the liver and skeletal muscles each have an even higher share of about 25%. The heart and kidneys each have a share of about 10% of the basal metabolic rate. Taken together, these organs are therefore responsible for about 85–90% of the basal metabolic rate!

What measurement parameters are used by direct and indirect calorimetry to determine energy expenditure?
- In direct calorimetry, the energy expenditure of an organism can be determined based on heat emission; in indirect calorimetry, it is based on O2 uptake and CO2 release. The principle of indirect calorimetry is based on the fact that during the metabolism of nutrients a certain amount of O2 is consumed and CO2 is produced. Since these gases cannot be stored, the consumed O2 corresponds to the inhaled O2 and the produced CO2 corresponds to the exhaled CO2. Based on two auxiliary quantities (caloric equivalent and respiratory quotient), one can deduce the energy expenditure of the organism from the measured respiratory gases.

What is the formula for calculating the energy expenditure in indirect calorimetry?
- The formula for calculating energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry is energy expenditure = (O2 uptake/min) × caloric equivalent.

What is referred to as the respiratory quotient and how is it calculated?
- The respiratory quotient is defined as the quotient of CO2 release and O2 uptake; the formula for calculating the RQ accordingly is RQ = VCO2/VO2. Each nutrient has a specific RQ, i.e., during the metabolism of different nutrients, differing amounts of O2 are consumed and CO2 is produced.

What is referred to as caloric equivalent and what is its approximate value for a mixed diet?
- The caloric equivalent denotes the energy value obtained from the oxidation of a certain nutrient per liter of oxygen. For a mixed diet, the caloric equivalent is 20 kJ/L O2.

### Heat Balance

What options are available to the organism for heat production?
- The majority of heat in the organism is generated through "waste heat," which is released during metabolic processes. Heat production through increased muscle activity (e.g., by walking around or muscle shivering) as well as through lipolysis in brown adipose tissue (especially relevant in newborns) only takes place when this waste heat is insufficient.

How does heat dissipation occur at outside temperatures that are above body temperature?
- At outside temperatures above body temperature, heat can only be dissipated through evaporation (sweating).

What is the underlying pathomechanism in the development of fever?
- In fever, there is an increase in the set-point temperature in the hypothalamus. The triggers are the so-called pyrogens, which can be foreign substances such as bacterial components (exogenous pyrogens), but also endogenous substances produced by the body, such as interleukin-1 secreted by leukocytes or prostaglandin E2 (endogenous pyrogens).

How and why does the composition of sweat change during heat acclimatization at high outdoor temperatures?
- During prolonged heat exposure in hot regions, as a result of heat acclimatization, the composition and amount of sweat change so that cooling of the body can occur more efficiently. On the one hand, the electrolyte content of sweat decreases, making it hypotonic. This way, the body loses fewer electrolytes even with increased sweating. On the other hand, sweat production overall increases and occurs faster (already at slight increases in body temperature).
