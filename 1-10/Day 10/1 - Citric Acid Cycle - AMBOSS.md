# Citric Acid Cycle
## Summary

The citric acid cycle is a cyclic sequence of reactions consisting of eight reactions. It plays a central role in metabolism: the acetyl-CoA, which is produced from the breakdown of almost all energy carriers in the organism, is oxidized to CO2 here, and the energy released in the process is stored in the form of the reducing equivalents FADH2 and NADH+H+. The citric acid cycle also serves as a supplier of substrates for various biosyntheses.

## Reaction Steps of the Citric Acid Cycle

The citric acid cycle can be divided into two phases: 1. The oxidation of acetyl-CoA to two CO2 with the formation of succinate and 2. the regeneration of the starting material oxaloacetate from succinate.

### Phase 1: Oxidation of Acetyl-CoA

|Reaction|Substrate|Enzyme|Product|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1. Synthesis of Citrate|- Acetyl-CoA<br>- Oxaloacetate|- Citrate synthase|- Citrate<br>- CoA|- Occurs in two steps:<br>    1. Condensation of the two substrates to form Citryl-CoA<br>    2. Removal of CoA|
|2. Isomerization of Citrate|- Citrate|- Aconitase (the name of the enzyme is derived from the intermediate of the reaction, cis-Aconitate)|- Isocitrate|- Equilibrium favors the side of citrate!|
|3. Oxidative Decarboxylation of Isocitrate|- Isocitrate|- Isocitrate Dehydrogenase|- α-Ketoglutarate<br>- CO2|- Co-Factor: NAD+ → NADH+H+|
|4. Oxidative Decarboxylation of α-Ketoglutarate|- α-Ketoglutarate|- α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase<br>    - Multienzyme complex consisting of three enzymes (these require the same cofactors as the enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase, namely: TPP, lipoyl, coenzyme A, FAD, and NAD+):<br>        - Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase<br>        - Transsuccinylase<br>        - α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase|- Succinyl-CoA<br>- CO2|- NAD+ → NADH+H+|
|5. Splitting of CoA|- Succinyl-CoA|- Succinyl-CoA synthetase|- Succinate<br>- CoA|- GDP → GTP<br>    - The energy released from the cleavage of the thioester bond between succinate and CoA is used to produce the high-energy molecule GTP in the sense of substrate-level phosphorylation.|

> [!NOTE] Brain tumor
> In some brain tumors (especially astrocytomas), a mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase can be detected. This leads to isocitrate being initially converted to α-ketoglutarate, which is then reduced to 2-hydroxyglutarate. The latter stimulates the methylation of certain DNA sections as an oncometabolite. Interestingly, the prognosis for astrocytomas with this mutation is better than for astrocytomas without this mutation.

### Phase 2: Regeneration of Oxaloacetate

|Reaction|Substrate|Enzyme|Product|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|6. Oxidation of succinate|- Succinate|- Succinate dehydrogenase: The succinate dehydrogenase is firmly embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is also part of protein complex II of the respiratory chain.|- Fumarate|- FAD → FADH2|
|7. Hydration of Fumarate|- Fumarate|- Fumarase|- Malate||
|8. Oxidation of Malate|- Malate|- Malate dehydrogenase|- Oxaloacetate|- NAD+ → NADH+H+<br>- Malate can also originate from the fumarate of the urea cycle, be transported into the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle, and thus be introduced into the citric acid cycle.|

## Regulation of the Citric Acid Cycle

Even before it begins, the citric acid cycle is already inhibited or activated by the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Within the cycle, several enzymes are allosterically regulated (see table).

- General principle: The following factors play a role in the regulation of the citric acid cycle
    1. Presence of the substrates
    2. Accrual of Products
    3. Energy supply of the cell

If the reduction equivalents FADH2 and NADH+H+ cannot be oxidized in the respiratory chain, for example, due to a lack of oxygen, the citric acid cycle is inhibited. The citric acid cycle can therefore only take place under aerobic conditions!

## Energy Balance of the Citric Acid Cycle

In the citric acid cycle, a total of three molecules of NADH+H+, one molecule of FADH2, and one molecule of GTP are produced. The reducing equivalents NADH+H+ and FADH2 are oxidized in the electron transport chain, with the energy released being used to produce ATP. Approximately 2.5 ATP are generated per molecule of NADH+H+, and about 1.5 ATP per FADH2.

- 7.5 ATP (from 3 NADH+H+) + 1.5 ATP (from 1 FADH2) + 1 ATP (from 1 GTP) = 10 ATP

## The Citric Acid Cycle as an Amphibolic Center of Metabolism

The second important function of the citric acid cycle is—besides energy production—the provision of synthesis precursors for many other metabolic pathways. It thus holds a central position in both catabolic and anabolic metabolism and is therefore referred to as the "amphibolic center" of metabolism. As a result of these biosyntheses, the citric acid cycle constantly suffers losses of intermediates. Therefore, there are so-called anaplerotic reactions that serve to replenish it with these intermediates.

### Role of the Citric Acid Cycle in the Various Metabolic Pathways

- Carbohydrate metabolism
    - Catabolism: Pyruvate, as the end product of glycolysis, is initially fed into the PDH reaction; there it is decarboxylated to Acetyl-CoA, which is then introduced into the citric acid cycle.
    - Anabol: Oxaloacetate serves as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.
- Amino acid metabolism
    - Catabolism: Amino acids are mainly broken down into substrates of the citric acid cycle.
    - Anabol: Intermediates of the citric acid cycle are used as substrates for the synthesis of non-essential amino acids.
        - E.g. α-Ketoglutarate → Glutamate, Oxaloacetate → Aspartate
- Fatty acid metabolism
    - Catabolism: Fatty acids are broken down into Acetyl-CoA, the starting substrate of the citric acid cycle.
    - Anabol: Citrate serves as a precursor for the synthesis of fatty acids and steroids.
- Porphyrin metabolism
    - Anabol: Succinyl-CoA serves as a precursor for the synthesis of porphyrins or heme.

### Anaplerotic Reactions

Anaplerotic reactions serve to maintain cyclic metabolic reactions (e.g., citric acid cycle) by replenishing them with their intermediates.

- Example citric acid cycle
    - Pyruvate carboxylase (Cofactor: Biotin)
        - Pyruvate + CO2 + ATP → Oxaloacetate + ADP+Pi
    - Malatenzyme
        - Pyruvate + CO2 + NADPH+H+ ⇄ Malate + NADP+
    - Glutamate dehydrogenase
        - Glutamate + NAD+ → α-Ketoglutarate + NH3 + NADH+H+

## Review Questions on the Citric Acid Cycle
### Overview

What is the purpose of the citric acid cycle or what is its goal?
- In the citric acid cycle, the Acetyl-CoA formed in preceding metabolic pathways (e.g., through glycolysis) is further broken down to CO2. Thus, the citric acid cycle holds a central position in metabolism. Through the cyclic sequence of reactions, the reduction equivalents FADH2 and NADH+H+ are formed, which subsequently enter the respiratory chain and are used there for energy production. In addition, various substrates for synthetic processes in the cell are produced in the citric acid cycle.
What conversions or reaction steps occur in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the citric acid cycle?
- In Phase 1 of the citric acid cycle, Acetyl-CoA is oxidized to two CO2 molecules, with succinate produced at the end of the reaction sequence (Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate → Citrate → Isocitrate → α-Ketoglutarate + CO2↑ → Succinyl-CoA + CO2↑ → Succinate). In Phase 2, the required starting material oxaloacetate is regenerated from succinate (Succinate → Fumarate → Malate → Oxaloacetate).
### Reaction Steps of the Citric Acid Cycle

Describe the first three reactions in Phase 1 in more detail (including involved enzymes, reaction type)!
- The first reaction of Phase 1 of the citric acid cycle is catalyzed by citrate synthase. In this reaction, citrate is formed from Acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate by the release of CoA. In the second reaction, citrate is simply rearranged to isocitrate. The enzyme required for the isomerization is called aconitase, which is derived from the intermediate of the reaction (cis-aconitate). Because isocitrate is rapidly further metabolized, the reaction proceeds in this direction, although the equilibrium actually lies on the side of citrate. Isocitrate is converted to α-ketoglutarate by oxidative decarboxylation, with CO2 generated as a byproduct. This reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and provides the first reduction equivalent NADH+H+.
What happens in the fourth (second to last) reaction of Phase 1 of the citric acid cycle? Describe the enzyme involved in a bit more detail!
- In the penultimate reaction of Phase 1 of the citric acid cycle, the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. This occurs via oxidative decarboxylation, and as in the oxidative decarboxylation in the previous step, CO2 and NADH+H+ are also produced. The α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex consists of three enzymes: dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase, transsuccinylase, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase E1. Functionally, the complex resembles the pyruvate dehydrogenase and also requires the same cofactors (TPP, lipoamide, coenzyme A, FAD, and NAD+).
What reaction concludes Phase 1 of the citric acid cycle?
- In the fifth and last reaction of Phase 1 of the citric acid cycle, succinate is formed by cleaving CoA from succinyl-CoA via succinyl-CoA synthetase. The energy released by cleavage of the thioester bond between succinate and CoA is used to form the energy-rich molecule GTP from GDP through substrate-level phosphorylation.
How is the starting material regenerated in Phase 2 of the citric acid cycle? Name the reaction types and the involved enzymes as well! Which enzyme has a dual function here?
- Phase 2 of the citric acid cycle begins with the sixth reaction. The oxidation of succinate is catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase (an enzyme located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and part of complex II of the respiratory chain). This produces fumarate as well as the reduction equivalent FADH2. Fumarate is subsequently converted to malate by fumarase via hydration. The last step to regenerate oxaloacetate is the oxidation of malate by malate dehydrogenase, which produces another NADH+H+. Thus, the cycle closes after eight reactions.
Where can the malate needed in the last step of the citric acid cycle also come from, and how is it introduced into the citric acid cycle?
- Malate can also be produced from fumarate of the urea cycle or by a so-called anaplerotic reaction. In the latter, the malate enzyme in the cytosol catalyzes the reductive carboxylation of pyruvate to malate. Malate is transported into the mitochondrion via the malate-aspartate shuttle and can be introduced into the citric acid cycle there.
### Regulation of the Citric Acid Cycle

What role does isocitrate dehydrogenase play in the regulation of the citric acid cycle?
- Regulation of the entire citric acid cycle is not possible; however, individual reaction steps can be activated or inhibited. For example, isocitrate dehydrogenase can be allosterically inhibited by ATP and NADH+H+ (the product of the reaction it catalyzes).
