# The Cell
## Summary

Cells are the smallest building and functional units of living organisms. The cell itself is already a living organism (think of bacterial cells or protozoa); however, cells often aggregate to form tissues or organisms.

All cells are surrounded by a membrane that consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins. In terms of structure, prokaryotic cells are distinguished from eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. In contrast, eukaryotic cells are very complex in structure and contain, in addition to the nucleus, a variety of organelles that perform highly specific functions. Furthermore, their cytosol is traversed by a network of filaments, known as the cytoskeleton. This is important for transport processes and the stability of the cell.

## Cell Types

One distinguishes prokaryotic from eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms without a nucleus, such as bacteria, blue-green algae, and archaebacteria. Eukaryotes are all cells that possess a nucleus and other cell organelles. They often group together into multicellular associations ("organisms" like plants, animals, fungi); however, there are also single-celled eukaryotes (protozoa). Eukaryotic cells are significantly larger (100 to 10,000 times) than prokaryotic cells and exhibit a distinctly more complex level of organization.

> [!note]
> Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus!


> [!note] Penicillins
> The cell wall is a critical point for bacteria. If its structure or maintenance is disturbed, the cell becomes non-viable. The human immune defense takes advantage of this in the fight against bacteria. For instance, the protein lysozyme destroys the peptidoglycan links in the cell wall, particularly of gram-positive bacteria. Medications also target this point: Penicillins inhibit the synthesis and cross-linking of peptidoglycan in gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, gram-negative bacteria are almost resistant to lysozyme and penicillins due to their additional cell membrane.


## Cell Membrane

Membranes are an indispensable component of living systems. They enclose both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and separate the "interior," where orderly and complex life processes occur, from the "chaotic outside world." Eukaryotic cells have, in addition to the cell membrane, intracellular membranes. They encase the individual organelles and allow specialized, orderly processes to take place in their interior, which should not be disturbed by the processes in the cytosol. Most prokaryotes and plant cells possess, in addition to the cell membrane, a cell wall that surrounds the cell membrane and protects the cells from the outside world.

### Construction of Membranes

Biomembranes consist of a lipid bilayer, to which membrane proteins are inserted and attached. The synthesis of the membrane components occurs in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

#### Lipid bilayer

- Construction
    - Amphiphilic lipids such as phospholipids or sphingolipids: Have a polar head group (e.g. phosphate, sphingosine) and nonpolar hydrocarbon tails (fatty acids)
    - Cholesterol: Has a polar OH group and a nonpolar steroid structure
        - Distribution of apolar and polar groups: In aqueous solution, the apolar hydrocarbon tails aggregate inward, while the polar head groups form an interface with the water in both directions → Stable lipid bilayers are formed, creating spherical structures (e.g. cells or vesicles).
        - Distribution of membrane lipids: While lipids can partially switch between the inner and outer lipid layers, certain lipids are predominantly found on one side.
            - Outer lipid layer: Rich in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin
            - Inner lipid layer: Rich in phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylinositol
                - An increased expression of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface acts as a phagocytic signal
- Properties
    - Permeability
        - Nearly impermeable to large polar molecules
        - Well permeable for small apolar compounds
    - Fluidity: Depending on the composition of the lipid bilayer and the temperature, the fluid properties of the membrane change.
        - High temperatures increase, low temperatures decrease fluidity.
        - Unsaturated fatty acids increase fluidity
        - Cholesterol
            - Decreased membrane fluidity at higher temperatures
            - Increases membrane fluidity at lower temperatures
    - Diffusion: The fluid properties of the lipid layer allow for the movement and spreading of individual molecules.
        - Lateral (parallel) diffusion: Within a lipid layer, individual lipid molecules are freely mobile.
        - Transverse Diffusion: Very slow, requires enzymatic support through flippases, floppases, or scramblases (so-called phospholipid translocators)
            - Flippases: Move phospholipids from the outside to the inside
            - Floppases: Move phospholipids from the inside to the outside
            - Scramblases: Move phospholipids in both directions

#### Membrane Proteins

- Definition
    - Proteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer of membranes
    - Frequently glycoproteins
- Membrane protein content in lipid bilayers: 20–80%
- Types of membrane proteins
    - Integral Membrane Proteins
        - Show a strong attachment to the lipid bilayer
        - Penetrate the membrane with a part
        - Transmembrane proteins: Completely penetrate the lipid bilayer (e.g., Na/K-ATPase++)
    - Peripheral membrane proteins
        - Have a weaker binding to the lipid bilayer
        - Often binding occurs through electrostatic attraction or hydrogen bonds between a peripheral and an integral membrane protein.
- Distribution of membrane proteins: Different composition of the inner and outer membrane surfaces.

|Examples of asymmetrically distributed membrane components|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Integral Membrane Proteins|Transmembrane Proteins|- Na/K-ATPase++|
|Unilateral integral membrane proteins|- Specific cyclooxygenases|
|Peripheral Membrane Proteins|After Extracellular|- Carbohydrate Side Chains of Glycoproteins<br>- Erythrocytic Acetylcholinesterase|
|Intracellular|- Phospholipase C|

> [!note] Antifungals
> In the cell membrane of fungi, ergosterol, which is chemically related to cholesterol, is present instead of cholesterol. This fact is utilized in the fight against fungal diseases: Many antifungal medications (antimycotics) work by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis. Since ergosterol is not present in animal - and thus also in human - cells, these remain unharmed.

> [!note] 
> Due to their fluidity, membranes are permeable to water and certain other small particles even without the use of specific channels or transporters. This property is referred to as semipermeability ("partial permeability")!


### Glycocalyx

- Definition: Layer of sugar molecules on the outer surface of the cell membrane in eukaryotic cells
- Construction
    - Long, branched carbohydrate chains
    - Covalently bound to proteins and to a lesser extent also to lipids of the cell membrane
    - Electron microscopically identifiable as a fuzzy edge
- Function
    - Protects cell from drying out
    - Antigen function
        - Allows immune cells to recognize a cell as self.
        - At the erythrocyte membrane: blood group differentiation

### Functions of Membranes

- Delimitation from the environment
    - Cell membrane: Delimitation of the cell to the outside
    - Membranes of the cell organelles (so-called endomembrane system): Delimitation of the compartments from the cytosol
- Transport of substances from inside to outside or from outside to inside (see: substance transport)
- Signal transduction: Conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular reactions
- Cell identification
    - Each cell expresses specific protein and carbohydrate fragments on its surface.
    - Through the specific surface fragments, it can be distinguished from other cells and recognized as "self."
- Electrical excitability
    - Enabled by the membrane potential
    - Upon excitation of the cell, the membrane potential briefly becomes positive by the opening of ion channels (see: action potential)
- Cell contact: Formed by anchor proteins (cell adhesion molecules) that protrude extracellularly and are connected intracellularly to the cytoskeleton.

## Cell Organelles

Cell organelles are compartments within cells that are surrounded by a membrane and perform very specific functions. In eukaryotes, there are many different organelles, whereas in prokaryotes, there is no compartmentalization.

To determine the size of the various cell components, they are isolated in several steps. This way, the following fractions are obtained through centrifugation (in descending size):

- Cell nuclei, components of the cytoskeleton
- Mitochondria, lysosomes, peroxisomes
- Microsomes as well as other small vesicles
- Ribosomes, viruses, large macromolecules

### Nucleus

#### Structure

The cell nucleus (nucleolus) is the most prominent intracellular structure and serves as the control center of the cell. It is surrounded by a double membrane and contains almost all of the genetic material.

##### Nucleus

The nuclear envelope consists of an inner and an outer nuclear membrane, each composed of a lipid bilayer. The two membranes enclose the perinuclear space, with the outer nuclear membrane extending into the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

- Outer nuclear membrane: Like the rough endoplasmic reticulum, it is studded with ribosomes.
- Inner nuclear membrane: Underlaid by the so-called nuclear lamina, a network of intermediate filaments (lamins) that serve to stabilize.
- Nuclear pores: At certain points, the inner and outer nuclear membranes fuse together, forming so-called nuclear pores with the help of a large protein complex.
    - Function
        - They control the transport of substances between the cytosol and nucleoplasm (so-called nucleocytoplasmic transport)
        - Active transport of larger proteins over approximately 40 kDa (e.g., nucleoplasmin) and RNAs, mediated by soluble importins and exportins
    - Active Transport
        - Ran (Ras-related nuclear Protein): Small G-protein and important mediator of protein nuclear import and export
        - Import: Binding of importins to the so-called nuclear localization signal (short amino acid sequence) on the protein → Importin + protein bound by importin pass through the nuclear pore into the nucleus → Ran-GTP binds to importin in the nucleus → Release of the transported protein in the nucleus
        - Export: Ran-GTP binds in the cell nucleus to exportin + a molecule bound by exportin through a nuclear export signal → transport through the nuclear pore into the cytosol → Ran-GTP is dephosphorylated to Ran-GDP → release of the protein bound by exportin

##### Contents of the Cell Nucleus

- Chromatin: Complex of DNA, histones, and non-histone proteins
- Nucleolus: Defined nuclear region with particularly high transcriptional activity for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

#### Functions

- Storage of almost the entire genetic information of an organism in the form of chromatin
- Doubling of the genetic information before a cell division (replication)
- Transcription: First step of protein biosynthesis
- Production of rRNA in the nucleolus
- Packaging and protection of non-active DNA by histone proteins
### Endoplasmic Reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a extensively branched membrane system in the cytosol that is directly connected to the outer membrane of the cell nucleus and forms a channel system of elongated cavities. Its main function is the synthesis of cellular components and cell export products. Microscopic and functionally, two areas can be distinguished: the rough and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

#### Structure

- Membranous canal system
- Connects directly with the outer membrane of the nucleus.
- Consists of two microscopically and functionally different areas
    - Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (rER): With attached ribosomes
    - Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER): Is not associated with ribosomes

#### Functions

- Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum
    - Synthesis of the proteins of the cell membrane, lysosomal and secretory proteins
    - Packaging of the synthesis products into vesicles for shipping to the Golgi apparatus (for further processing) or directly to the destination
- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
    - Synthesis of phospholipids, long-chain fatty acids, and steroids
    - Carbohydrate storage and release of stored carbohydrates
    - Biotransformation
    - Calcium storage (see: Muscle tissue)
### Golgi Apparatus

The Golgi apparatus is located in the cell between the ER and the cell membrane and is responsible for the further processing of substances formed in the ER. It presents itself as a membranous, disc-shaped vesicle system that has two sides: the convex Cis-Golgi side and the concave Trans-Golgi side.

#### Structure

- Membrane-bound, disc-shaped, slightly curved vesicle system with two sides
    - Cis-Golgi side (convex side): Curves slightly around the ER
        - Function: Here, protein-laden membrane vesicles are received from the ER.
    - Trans-Golgi side (concave side): Facing the cell membrane
        - Function: Vesicles are pinched off here and sent towards the cell membrane and lysosomes.

#### Functions

- Modification of glycoproteins and hormone precursors from the ER as well as endocytosed membrane proteins (e.g., O-glycosylation by galactosyltransferase)
- Activation of hormones and other proteins
- Addressing secretory proteins by attaching a sequence that defines the destination of the protein.
- Synthesis of lysosomes and their filling with enzymes
- Recycling of membrane components


> [!note] I-cell disease
> In the Golgi apparatus, the enzymes that are to be transported to the lysosomes are tagged with a mannose-6-phosphate residue ("addressing"). Without this addressing, the enzymes cannot find their way into the lysosomes and instead pass through the plasma membrane into the blood. This is precisely what occurs in the extremely rare I-cell disease, which is classified as a lysosomal storage disorder and is associated with severe psychomotor retardation and skeletal deformities.

### Mitochondria

Mitochondria are also referred to as the "powerhouses of the cell," as their main function is the synthesis of the body's most important energy carrier: ATP. In addition, they fulfill other essential metabolic functions. They consist of a double membrane, the intermembrane space, and the matrix. Depending on the structure of the inner membrane, different types of mitochondria are distinguished.

#### Structure

Mitochondria resemble prokaryotes in their structure and DNA, which is why it is believed that they were originally free-living bacteria (see: endosymbiotic theory).

##### Mitochondrial membrane

The mitochondrial membrane, like the nuclear membrane, consists of two layers.

###### Outer Mitochondrial Membrane

- Structure: Smooth
- Permeability: Interspersed with pores and therefore well permeable for many substances.
    - Mitochondrial Porin (Voltage-dependent Anion Channel, VDAC): Allows the regulated passage of negatively charged molecules (e.g., chloride, phosphate, nucleotides)

###### Inner Mitochondrial Membrane

- Structure: Folded
- Permeability: Impermeable, however, there are many transporters and channels in the inner membrane (see below).
- Important component: Cardiolipin (stabilizes the enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation)

##### Shape of the inner membrane

- Mitochondria of the crista type
    - Thin invaginations (Cristae) of the inner membrane
    - Occurs in most cells
- Mitochondria of the tubule type
    - Inner membrane forms tubes
    - Mainly in cells that produce steroid hormones
- Mitochondria of the sacculus type
    - The inner membrane is folded (cristae) with bead-like protrusions
    - Only in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex

##### Carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane

Specific transporters and permeases regulate the substance transport through the inner membrane.

- Functional mechanism: Antiport of two substances
- Examples
    - Malate-Aspartate Shuttle: Transport of reducing equivalents
        1. Cytosol: Transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADH to oxaloacetate, resulting in the formation of malate (Enzyme: Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase)
        2. Transport of malate through the inner mitochondrial membrane and against α-ketoglutarate using the malate/α-ketoglutarate carrier (also known as malate/2-oxoglutarate carrier)
        3. Mitochondrial Matrix: Reoxidation of malate to oxaloacetate by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, resulting in the formation of NADH again.
        4. Mitochondrial Matrix: Transamination of oxaloacetate together with glutamate into aspartate and α-ketoglutarate
        5. Transport of aspartate through the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol using another carrier protein in exchange for glutamate.
        6. Zytosol: Deamination of aspartate to oxaloacetate, while α-ketoglutarate is simultaneously converted to glutamate.
    - Glycerin-3-phosphate shuttle: Transport of reducing equivalents
        1. Cytosol: Transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADH to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, resulting in the formation of glycerol-3-phosphate.
        2. Transport of glycerol-3-phosphate to the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane
        3. Mitochondrial intermembrane space: Oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate
        4. Inner mitochondrial membrane: Transfer of electrons first to FAD and then to ubiquinone
    - Carnitine-Acylcarnitine-Transporter
    - Aspartate-Glutamate-Carrier

> [!note]
> In the malate-aspartate shuttle, NADH+ is not transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, but rather its electrons!

##### Mitochondrial Matrix

- Includes, among other things, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and some ribosomes that are responsible for the synthesis of approximately 1% of mitochondrial proteins (e.g., some proteins of the respiratory chain)
- The remaining mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus and arrive unfolded in the mitochondrion, where they assume their final folded structure.

#### Function

- Energy metabolism: At the inner mitochondrial membrane, a large portion of the energy in the form of ATP that the organism needs is produced in the respiratory chain through oxidative phosphorylation.
- Other metabolic processes in the matrix
    - Citric acid cycle
    - Fatty acid degradation (β-Oxidation)
    - Ketone body synthesis
    - Urea Cycle
    - Pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction
    - Hamsynthesis
- Introduction of apoptosis: Apoptosis can be initiated by the release of the Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial matrix.

#### Excursus: Endosymbiotic Theory

The mitochondria resemble prokaryotes due to their DNA (high gene density, circular structure). Their ribosomes also show strong similarities to the 70S ribosomes of bacteria. For this reason, it is suspected that mitochondria were originally independently viable bacteria that had the unique ability to provide energy through oxidative phosphorylation. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that during evolution, such a bacterial cell was taken up by a eukaryotic cell, lost part of its DNA over time, and thus was no longer independently viable. Mitochondrial DNA now encodes for only about 1% of mitochondrial proteins. The remaining portion of the proteins is encoded by the nuclear genome, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and imported into the mitochondria. The eukaryotic cell, in turn, became dependent on the energy production of the incorporated bacterial cell.

> [!note] Aminoglycoside
> Due to the similarity of mitochondrial nucleic acids with those of bacteria, a specific mutation of mitochondrial DNA can lead to an increased occurrence of unwanted side effects when taking aminoglycoside antibiotics. These medications can be ototoxic and lead to deafness. Aminoglycosides actually target bacterial ribosomal RNA. However, if there is a mutation in mitochondrial DNA, the resulting mitochondrial ribosomal RNA is also altered in such a way that it becomes more sensitive to aminoglycosides. The exact cause of why the binding of aminoglycosides can lead to deafness is still not conclusively clarified.

> [!note] Mitochondrial diseases
> Mitochondria are inherited maternally, and accordingly, so are the defects of mitochondrial DNA. Since mitochondria are present in very large numbers and not all need to be defective at the same time, there are significant variations in the type and severity of the disease. Tissues with high oxygen consumption, such as the brain (mitochondrial encephalopathy) or muscle (mitochondrial myopathies), are usually affected by such defects.

### Lysosomes

Lysosomes are often referred to as the "garbage cans" of the cell. Their main task is the breakdown of biopolymers into monomers. They are small, spherical organelles filled with acidic fluid, surrounded by a biomembrane (lipid bilayer).

#### Structure

- A liquid space surrounded by a lipid bilayer with an acidic environment and hydrolytic enzymes
    - Hydrolytic enzymes: lipases, glucosidases, acid phosphatases, nucleases, endoproteases (e.g. cathepsins)
        - Origin of the hydrolytic enzymes
            - Enzymes are synthesized by ribosomes directly into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the Golgi apparatus.
            - In the Golgi apparatus, a mannose-6-phosphate molecule is added post-translationally.
            - Marked enzymes are pinched off in vesicles, this vesicle is now referred to as a primary lysosome.
    - Acidic environment (pH value of about 5)
        - Optimal for the hydrolytic enzymes
        - Results from the active transport of H+-ions through the membrane-bound H-ATPase+

> [!note]
> The leading enzyme of the lysosomes is acid phosphatase!
#### Function

- Intracellular lysosomal degradation of macromolecules
    - Process
        1. The lysosome in its resting state (primary lysosome) is formed by budding off from the Golgi apparatus.
        2. Fuses with vesicles that contain structures to be degraded (now referred to as a secondary lysosome)
        3. The hydrolytic enzymes contained in the secondary lysosome break down the macromolecules.
        4. Split products are released into the cytosol and can be reused for new synthesis processes.
        5. Telolysosomes (Residual Bodies): During lysosomal degradation, indigestible lipofuscin can form, which accumulates with age in nerve, liver, and cardiac muscle cells.
    - Origin of the macromolecules
        - Endocytosis
            - Receptor-mediated endocytosis: Vesicles are then called endosomes.
            - Phagocytosis: Vesicles are then called phagosomes.
        - Autophagy
            - In all body cells, aged or dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and cell organelles are first separated from the cytoplasm by autophagosomes (also known as autophagic vacuoles) with a double membrane.
            - Subsequently, they fuse with lysosomes to form an autolysosome.
            - The inner membrane and the old cell components are broken down and are no longer differentiable.
            - Breakdown products are subsequently released back into the cytosol (e.g. for the "recycling" of amino acids)
- Autolysis: In the case of severe cell damage, the contents of the lysosomes are released into the cytosol. This causes the cell to dissolve (see also: apoptosis).

> [!note]
> Lysosomes play an important role in the specific immune response. Antigens are broken down in lysosomes after endocytic uptake in so-called antigen-presenting cells (e.g., macrophages, B-lymphocytes). The fragments are bound to MHC-II proteins, which are transported to the cell surface by exocytosis and expressed there (antigen presentation). This leads to the activation of T-helper cells!
### Peroxisomes

Peroxisomes resemble lysosomes in their structure. They are located in the cytosol and contain enzymes that oxidize amino acids and fatty acids with the consumption of oxygen.

#### Structure

- Small round vesicles that are surrounded by a membrane.

#### Function

- Degradation (β-Oxidation) of long-chain fatty acids to octanoyl-CoA (8 C-atoms)
- Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
    - The monooxygenases in the peroxisomes convert their substrates using oxygen.
    - The cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) produced in the process is converted into water and oxygen using the enzyme catalase (2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2)
- Synthesis of ether lipids (so-called plasmalogens)
- Partial steps of steroid hormone synthesis, bile acid synthesis, etc.


> [!note] Zellweger syndrome
> In this hereditary disease, the formation and function of peroxisomes is significantly impaired, leading to an accumulation of cytotoxic hydrogen peroxide. Affected individuals suffer from neurological and hepatointestinal symptoms and usually die within the first year of life.


## Cytosol and Ribosomes

### Zytosol

The cytosol, also called the matrix, is enclosed by the cell membrane. In prokaryotes, with a few exceptions, all metabolic pathways occur within the cytosol, while in eukaryotes, the cell organelles take over some of these processes and can be separated from the cytosol by a membrane (compartmentalization).

#### Structure

- Water and dissolved ions and small molecules in it (70%)
- Proteins such as enzymes of many metabolic pathways (30%)

#### Function

- Metabolic processes (e.g. glycolysis, translation, protein degradation)

> [!note]
> The cytoplasm encompasses everything that lies within the cell membrane but outside the nucleus. This includes the cytosol, the cell organelles, and the cytoskeleton!

### Ribosomes

Ribosomes are very large molecular complexes made of RNA and proteins, which are found in the cytosol, on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and in the mitochondria. The second part of protein biosynthesis takes place on them: translation.

#### Structure

- General Structure
    - Granular particles made of ⅓ proteins and ⅔ RNA with two subunits
    - When multiple ribosomes attach to an mRNA, this complex is referred to as a polysome (also known as a polyribosome).
- Mass: The mass of the subunits is specified using the sedimentation constant (unit: Svedberg, S).
    - Small subunit: 40S in eukaryotes, 30S in prokaryotes
    - Large subunit: 60S in eukaryotes, 50S in prokaryotes
    - Total mass: 80S in eukaryotes, 70S in prokaryotes

#### Localization

- Cytosolic ribosomes: Are either free in the cytosol or bound to elements of the cytoskeleton.
- Membrane-bound ribosomes: Are attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

#### Function

- Translation: Ribosomes provide the structural prerequisites for protein biosynthesis and are catalytically active; their RNA components interact, among other things, with mRNA and tRNA and catalyze the formation of the peptide bond.
    - For example, in prokaryotes, the mRNA binds to the 16S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit via a so-called Shine-Dalgarno sequence and regulates the initiation of translation.


> [!note]
> Cytosolic proteins (such as tubulin) are synthesized on free ribosomes. Secretory proteins (that is, those intended for export) and membrane proteins are synthesized on the ribosomes of the rough ER!
### Cytoskeleton

The cytosol is traversed by a three-dimensional network of filaments known as the cytoskeleton. It is responsible for the stabilization and movement of cells, as well as for transport processes within the cell.

#### Overview

- Function
    - Stabilization and movement of the cell
    - Transport processes within the cell
- Structure: Composed of filaments and specific accompanying proteins
    - Filaments: Elongated cell structures composed of monomers
        - Depending on the diameter, actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments are distinguished.
    - Chaperone: Are responsible for various functions of the cytoskeleton (mobility, assembly and disassembly of monomers, etc.)
        - Motor proteins: Important accompanying proteins that are responsible for the mobility of the filaments, e.g. dynein

#### The most important components of the cytoskeleton

> [!note]
> The word component "intermediate" in "intermediate filaments" refers to the fact that intermediate filaments have a diameter that is, on average, between that of actin filaments (smaller diameter) and that of microtubules (larger diameter)!

> [!note] Intermediate filaments as tumor markers
> The filaments that normally occur in cells are also increasingly expressed during an uncontrolled division of these cells (in the sense of a tumor) and can therefore be used as immunohistochemical markers in tumor diagnostics. For example, vimentin – as an intermediate filament of the cytoskeleton of all mesenchymal cells – is primarily associated with tumors of mesenchymal origin such as sarcomas and mesotheliomas. Desmin – the intermediate filament in smooth and striated muscle – is, on the other hand, increasingly detectable in tumors of muscular origin such as rhabdomyosarcomas and leiomyosarcomas.

> [!note] Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
> The primary ciliary dyskinesia is mostly an autosomal recessive disorder of mucociliary transport. Often, the transport protein dynein is defective, which leads to a dysfunction of the cilia. Primarily affected is the respiratory ciliated epithelium, but sperm motility is also impaired. The consequences are chronic sinus infections as well as infertility in male affected individuals. In about half of the cases, there are positional anomalies of the organs during embryonic development, such as situs inversus (Kartagener syndrome).

## Cell Contacts

Cells are mostly connected to other cells or surrounding structures through cell contacts. The type and number of these contacts vary greatly between different cell types: while erythrocytes do not form cell contacts, epithelial cells are firmly connected to each other and to the basement membrane. In addition to tight and adhesive contacts, there are also communicating contacts, which play an important role in the transmission of impulses in cardiac muscle cells, for example.

### Closing Contacts

- Tight Junction (Zonula occludens or barrier contact): Consists of the membrane proteins Claudin and Occludin and serves as a very tight contact between two cells, which closes the intercellular space and acts as a diffusion barrier.
    - Structure
        - Membrane proteins (claudins and occludins) of two cells connect with each other.
        - They are connected to the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton through adapter proteins.
    - Localization: Often in the apical region between epithelial cells
    - Function
        - Controls the flow of ions and molecules
        - Diffusion barrier
        - Separation of compartments (e.g., intestinal lumen from intestinal wall): Separates the basal from the apical cell compartments of the epithelial cells.

### Adhesive Contacts (Adhesion Contacts)

With the adhesive contacts, these are mechanical connections of cells. Based on the different functions, several forms are distinguished.

- Desmosome (macula adherens): connection of two cells with each other involving the intermediate filaments of the participating cells.
    - Structure
        - On the inner side of the cell membrane, there is a so-called desmoplakin plaque, into which the involved intermediate filaments enter from the intracellular side and the so-called desmosomal cadherins (mainly desmoglein and desmocollin) radiate from the extracellular side.
        - The cadherins connect the desmoplakin plaques of two cells with each other.
    - Occurrence/Function: Connecting, especially cells with high mechanical stress (e.g. epithelial cells and cardiac muscle cells)
- Hemidesmosome ("Half Desmosome"): Connects not two cells, but a cell with the extracellular space.
    - Structure (similar to desmosomes): The transmembrane protein integrin connects the intracellular cytoskeleton (the intermediate filaments) with the laminin molecules of the basement membrane.
    - Occurrence/Function: Connects epithelial cells to the basement membrane
- Adherens junction (belt desmosome): Connects cells closely together over a wider (belt-like) area.
    - Structure: On the inner side of the cell membrane, there is Vinculin and Catenin, which connect intracellular actin filaments with transmembrane cadherins (mainly E-Cadherin).
    - Occurrence/Function: Connecting, e.g., epithelial cells and endothelial cells in a belt-like fashion to each other.
- Focal contacts: Connects (similar to hemidesmosomes) cells with the extracellular matrix.
    - Structure: Transmembrane proteins of the cell membrane (particularly integrins) are connected to actin fibers of the cytoskeleton.
    - Occurrence/Function: For example, in mobile cells such as macrophages
### Communicating Contacts

The communicating contacts allow for the free flow of electrical or chemical signals. Two forms are distinguished.

- Gap Junction (Nexus): Cell-cell channels that form between two cells
    - Structure: Forms through the aggregation of the connexons of two cells
        - Connexon: Consists of six membrane-spanning proteins (so-called connexins) that leave a pore in the center.
        - Connexons in the cell membranes are permeable to ions and molecules up to a size of approximately 1 kDa.
    - Occurrence/Function: Particularly cardiac muscle cells, but also epithelia and retina
- Synapse

Pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid
Pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid are both blistering autoimmune diseases of the skin. In pemphigus vulgaris, antibodies against desmosomal proteins (especially desmoglein) are causative, while in bullous pemphigoid, antibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins (e.g., collagen XVII) are involved.
