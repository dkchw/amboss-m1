# Spinal Cord
## Summary

The spinal cord is a rod-shaped collection of nerve cell bodies and fibers and is protected within the bony vertebral canal. Functionally, it serves as the connection between the body's periphery and the brain (so-called connecting apparatus). It consists of a complex system of ascending sensory and descending motor pathways.

The nerves of the sensors of the periphery (e.g., the mechanosensors of the skin) enter the spinal cord in the form of a nerve root (dorsal root) from the dorsal side, from where the sensory pathways transport the information to the brain. The descending motor pathways transmit efferent information from the brain to executing structures of the body periphery (e.g., to the muscles) and exit the spinal cord as motor fibers on its ventral side in the form of the so-called ventral root.

The fibers of the dorsal and ventral roots merge to form the so-called spinal nerves, which represent the separation between the spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system. At the same time, the spinal cord is divided into so-called segments by the exit of the various spinal nerves. Since the spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral column, the most caudal spinal nerves run like a "horse tail" (cauda equina) through the vertebral canal before they exit at their corresponding vertebra.

In addition to sensory and motor neurons, the spinal cord also contains autonomic neurons, which among other things, are responsible for the regulation of the autonomic nervous system and the circuitry of so-called visceral and mixed reflexes.
## Spinal Cord as a Whole

The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system and consists of nerve cell bodies (especially in the so-called gray matter), their nerve cell extensions (especially in the so-called white matter) and glial cells. These components are organized in a complex system of nuclei and tracts. Here, the spinal cord is described as a whole with its externally visible features, segments, membranes, and vessels.

### Profile

- Functions
    - Independent interconnection of information (spinal reflexes)
    - Connection between peripheral nervous system and brain
- Location: In the bony vertebral canal
- Shape: Stab-shaped
- Length: Approx. 45 cm (from the medulla oblongata to the vertebral body L1/L2)
- Diameter: Approx. 1 cm

### External Characteristics

From the outside, the spinal cord resembles a rod with two thickened areas. These thickened areas are created by the numerous nerve cells whose axons form the brachial plexus and the lumbosacral plexus. The spinal cord is flanked dorsally by incoming nerve roots (sensory posterior roots) and ventrally by outgoing nerve roots (motor anterior roots). Since the spinal cord is shorter than the vertebral column, these nerve roots continue below the spinal cord as a bundle of fibers (the so-called “horse tail” or cauda equina) further in the vertebral canal.

- Thickening
    - Cervical intumescence (height approx. C4–T1)
    - Lumbosacral intumescence (height approx. T10–12)
- Furrows
    - Anterior median fissure
    - Posterior median sulcus
    - Anterolateral sulcus
    - Posterolateral sulcus
    - Posterior Intermediate Sulcus
- Nerve roots
    - Ventral: Ventral root (Anterior root)
    - Dorsal: Hinterwurzel (Posterior root)
- Fiber braid starting at the caudal end: Cauda equina

### Segmentation into Segments

The nerve roots of the anterior and posterior horns exit the spinal cord at regular intervals and unite to form so-called spinal nerves. This segments the spinal cord, with each segment giving rise to a pair of spinal nerves. The number of segments thus corresponds to the number of vertebrae, with the exception of the cervical vertebrae. The cervical cord gives rise to 8 pairs of spinal nerves, even though the cervical spine only has 7 vertebrae.

| |Number of segments|
|---|---|
|Cervical (C1–C8)|8|
|Thoracic (Th1–Th12)|12|
|Lumbar (L1–L5)|5|
|Sacral (S1–S5)|5|
|Coccygeal (Co1–Co3)|1–3|
|Total|31–33|

> [!NOTE]
> The segmental structure of the spine plays an important role in the organization of the peripheral nervous system, as each segment is responsible for a specific skin area (dermatome) in a sensory manner and a specific muscle, known as the key muscle, in a motor manner. Larger muscles are innervated by several overlapping segments!

> [!NOTE]
> Only in the cervical part of the spine do the pairs of spinal nerves leave the spinal cord above the corresponding vertebral body. All other pairs of spinal nerves leave the spinal cord below the corresponding vertebral bodies!

> [!NOTE] Radicular C5 syndrome
> Due to the segmental structure of the spinal cord, it is possible to deduce the anatomical location of the damage based on the pattern of sensory and motor deficits during the neurological examination. The symptoms resulting from damage to the nerve root of a spinal cord segment are summarized as the so-called radicular syndrome. For example, if the root of segment C5 is damaged due to a herniated disc, this results in a characteristic constellation of sensory and motor deficits, known as the C5 syndrome. The strength of the ipsilateral muscle groups of the segment (M. deltoideus and M. biceps brachii) is reduced (paresis), which also leads to a weakening of the associated reflex (biceps tendon reflex). The sensitivity of the ipsilateral dermatome C5 (skin of the lateral shoulder) is diminished or absent. Damage to the roots of other spinal cord segments also leads to specific radicular syndromes.

## White Matter

In cross-section, the spinal cord shows a mirror-symmetrical structure. At its center lies the cerebrospinal fluid-filled central canal, which is considered the internal cerebrospinal space of the spinal cord. Surrounding the central canal is the butterfly-shaped gray matter, which is in turn encased by the white matter. Ventrally and dorsally of the central canal, the two parts of the gray and white matter (the "wings of the butterfly") are connected to each other. These connections are referred to as the commissura alba and commissura grisea.

### Structure

The white matter of the spinal cord primarily consists of myelinated axons. In a cross-section of the spinal cord, it can be macroscopically divided into an anterior, a lateral, and a posterior funiculus.

- Macroscopy
    - Subdivision into strands
        - Hinterstrang (Posterior funiculus of the spinal cord)
        - Lateral funiculus of the spinal cord
        - Vorderstrang (Anterior funiculus of the spinal cord)
    - Commissures: Connection of both halves of the white matter
        - Ventral: Anterior white commissure
        - Dorsal: Posterior white commissure
- Microscopy: Primarily consists of nerve cells, axons and glial cells (see: Fundamentals of the nervous system)

> [!NOTE]
> The anterior and the lateral tracts are not clearly distinguishable anatomically and are therefore summarized as the so-called "anterior lateral tract." In contrast, the posterior and lateral tracts are separated by the posterolateral tract!

### Functional Structure

The function of the white matter mainly consists of connecting the nerve centers of the spinal cord and brain with each other (so-called conduction apparatus). The fibers of the conduction apparatus of the white matter can be divided into a so-called connecting and an own apparatus based on their function. For details on the pathways, their functions, and courses see: Spinal conduction pathways and reflexes.

- Eigenapparat: Connection of spinal cord segments to each other
## Gray Matter

### Macroscopic Structure

When considering the spinal cord as a whole, functionally interconnected nerve cells are noticeable, which are arranged in groups above and below one another. This results in three separate columns of functionally related neurons (sensitivity, motor function, autonomic nervous system) along the entire length of the spinal cord. These three columns appear macroscopically as three horns (anterior, posterior, and lateral horn) in cross-section. The main function of the nerve cells in the gray matter lies in the integration of incoming/received impulses.

| Organization of the gray matter into columns and horns |                                                                                                            |                                                                                                           |

### Microscopic Structure

The gray matter is histologically mainly composed of the cell bodies of nerve cells. The basic structure of a nerve cell and its components is explained in the chapter "Nervous tissue, synapses, and transmitters". At this point, on the one hand, the histological organization of the gray matter will be presented, and on the other hand, an overview of the different types of nerve cells in the gray matter will be provided.

#### Histological Organization

The structure of the gray matter of the spinal cord can be divided not only macroscopically into anterior, lateral, and posterior horns but also based on histological criteria. On one hand, the horns of the gray matter are classified from dorsal to ventral into ten layers (laminae according to Rexed I–X). On the other hand, functionally related nerve cells are grouped into individual nuclei. These partially overlap with the classification into the laminae.

- Definitions
    - Nuclei (of the gray matter): Summary of functionally interconnected neurons in the gray matter
    - Laminae (of the gray matter): In total, ten layers into which the gray matter is divided from dorsal to ventral.

|Macroscopically visible "spinal cord horn"|Contained laminae|Important nuclei and laminae (and their overlaps)|
|---|---|---|
|Hinterhorn|I–VI|- Lamina II ≈ Gelatinous substance<br>- Laminae III–IV ≈ Proper nucleus<br>- Laminae V–VI ≈ Dorsal nucleus (=Posterior thoracic nucleus = Stilling−Clarke nucleus)|
|Side Horn|VII and X|- Lamina VII (thoracolumbar) ≈ Intermediolateral nucleus<br>- Lamina VII (sacral) ≈ Sacral parasympathetic nuclei|
|Vorderhorn|VIII and IX|- Motor anterior horn nuclei (Motor neurons)|

#### Neuron Types

The neurons of the spinal cord can be categorized into three main groups: root cells, tract cells, and interior cells. The root cells, which include motoneurons and autonomic neurons, form the ventral roots with their fibers. The tract cells are long projection neurons, whose axons form the long pathways of the spinal cord (connecting apparatus see below) on one hand and connect spinal neurons with one another on the other hand (own apparatus see below). Interior cells are interneurons that also connect spinal neurons with one another (own apparatus see below). Their most important representative is the so-called Renshaw cells, which have an inhibitory effect on the α-motoneurons of the ventral horns.

In the literature, the classification of the neuronal groups of the spinal cord is presented inconsistently. Some authors classify the strand cells as interior cells!

|Neuron group|Nerve cell type / Subtype|   |Location of cell bodies|Function|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Root cells (efferent)|- Motoneurons|- α-Motoneurons (large)|- Anterior horns|- Innervation of the skeletal muscle|
|- γ-Motoneuron (small)|- Innervation of the muscle spindles|
|- Vegetative Neuron|- Sympathetic (C8–L2)|- Lateral Horns|- Sympathetic Visceral Afferents|
|- Parasympathetic (S2–S4)|- Parasympathetic center for pelvic organs (viszeroefferent): Erection, urination, and defecation|
|Strang cells (especially afferent)|- Projection neurons|   |- Dorsal horns and lateral horns|- Transmission of peripheral afferents to the brain through ascending fiber bundles (tracts) in the white matter (connecting apparatus see below)<br>- Connection of spinal cord neurons to each other (part of the intrinsic apparatus see below)|
|Interneurons (primarily inhibitory)|- Interneurons|- Renshaw cells|- Distributed in gray matter|- Activation by α-motoneurons via acetylcholine<br>- Recurrent inhibition of α-motoneurons by glycine or GABA|
|- Switching cells<br>- Association cells<br>- Commissural cells|- Connect spinal cord neurons with each other (part of the intrinsic apparatus see below)|

> [!NOTE] Hereditary spinal muscular atrophies  
> There is a group of genetic disorders in which there is an isolated degeneration of the motor neurons of the anterior horn in the spinal cord. Since these motor neurons are responsible for the innervation of skeletal muscles, their failure leads to muscle paralysis (paresis) on one hand and to muscle wasting (atrophy) on the other. This muscle wasting was the namesake for the group of so-called hereditary spinal muscular atrophies.

> [!NOTE] Conus Medullaris Syndrome 
> In the context of tumors of the lower spine or larger herniated discs, there can be a combined damage to the conus medullaris and cauda equina. This is referred to as the so-called conus-cauda syndrome. On one hand, the autonomic reflex centers in the conus medullaris are damaged, which can be associated with bladder, rectal disturbances, and impotence. On the other hand, the sensory and motor fibers of the cauda equina are damaged. This can lead to both flaccid paralysis of the leg muscles and a sensory disturbance of the dermatomes S3–S5 (the so-called saddle anesthesia). In addition, the reflexes that are processed in the conus medullaris and cauda equina are also affected. These include reflexes (e.g., anal reflex and bulbocavernosus reflex) as well as muscle spindle reflexes (e.g., ASR, PSR).

## Topography

### Overview

- Borders
    - Cranial: Transition to the decussation of the pyramids (Medulla oblongata)/1. Spinal nerve
    - Caudal: Ends as conus medullaris with cauda equina
    - Topographical distinction from the peripheral nervous system: The spinal nerves and their nerve roots, including the cauda equina, are already counted as part of the peripheral nervous system.
- Fixation: Via filum terminale
    - Cranial at Foramen magnum
    - Caudal am Os sacrum

> [!NOTE] Tethered-Cord-Syndrome
> During the growth of the spine and spinal cord, there may be an adhesion of a portion of the spinal cord (usually the filum terminale) with the dura of the spinal canal. As a result, the faster-growing spine exerts a pull on the spinal cord. This pull can impair the function of the affected parts of the spinal cord, which can manifest as back pain up to symptoms of spinal cord injury with muscle paralysis or bladder and bowel disorders. This condition, referred to as the tethered cord syndrome (English for "tethered spinal cord"), commonly occurs with other defects in the development of the spinal cord (e.g., meningomyelocele). The treatment of choice is the surgical resolution of the adhesions.

### Meninges and Spaces of the Spinal Cord

Like all parts of the central nervous system, the spinal cord is also surrounded by the soft inner and hard outer meninges (meninges). In this case, the arrangement of the membranes and spaces differs slightly from that of the brain, resulting in other interspaces such as a physiological epidural space.

The meninges and spaces are arranged from the inside out as follows.

1. Spinal cord surface fused with Pia mater
2. Subarachnoid space
3. The arachnoid mater merges with the dura mater, together forming the dural sac.
    - Durasack: Encases the spinal cord, Cauda equina and spinal ganglia and typically ends at the level of the second sacral vertebra.
4. Epidural space: Contains fat tissue, a venous plexus, and (briefly crossing) spinal nerves
5. Periosteum of the vertebral body

> [!NOTE] Lumbar Puncture
> The examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (nerve fluid) can provide important information in the diagnosis of diseases of the central nervous system. To avoid injuring the spinal cord when obtaining the liquor, the spinal canal is punctured below the spinal cord (below the conus medullaris at L1/L2). To facilitate the puncture, the patient should sit bent forward with a rounded back, as this expands the intervertebral spaces dorsally. To collect the liquor, a thin needle is advanced between the spinous processes of the vertebrae L3/L4 or L4/L5 through the dura and arachnoid into the subarachnoid space. The liquor can now be obtained from this outer liquor space. The correct puncture site is found by connecting the upper edges of the iliac crests in an imaginary line, as this approximately corresponds to the height of L3/L4.

> [!NOTE] Spinal anesthesia  
> The lumbar puncture is used not only for the extraction of cerebrospinal fluid but also for the injection of medications. For example, a local anesthetic can be administered into the subarachnoid space, where it can spread variably depending on the dose and position of the patient. This blocks the anterior and posterior roots of the local spinal nerves, which is why this procedure is referred to as spinal anesthesia. If only very specific spinal nerve roots or even just individual fibers of these roots (e.g., only sensory fibers) need to be blocked, the anesthetic must be injected into the epidural space at the corresponding spinal level (so-called epidural anesthesia). Since this space is filled with fat, the local anesthetic spreads significantly less extensively than in the cerebrospinal fluid-filled subarachnoid space. Additionally, the fibers react differently to the local anesthetic, so that the various qualities manifest at different doses (resulting in soon-to-be mothers with PDA feeling less in their legs but still able to walk).

## Vascular Supply

The vascular supply of the spinal cord is ensured by two heavily anastomosing arterial systems (horizontal and vertical). However, the exchange of substances occurs only through the vertical system, which lies directly on the spinal cord. It consists of the anterior spinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries. This system receives blood through the branches of the horizontal system. These branches arise in the head region from the vertebral arteries and directly from the aorta below. Venous blood also drains through a horizontal and vertical venous system.

### Arterial Supply

#### Horizontal System

- Definition: The horizontal system is a network of arteries that usually originate from direct branches of the aorta and supply blood to the vertical system of the spinal cord.
- Associated vessels
    - Spinal nerves divide into
        - A. radicularis anterior
        - A. radicularis posterior
- Origin vessels of the segmental spinal branches
    - Cervical artery: A. subclavia (Vertebral arteries, deep cervical and ascending)
    - Thoracic spine: Thoracic aorta (Intercostal arteries)
    - Lumbosacral region: Abdominal aorta (Lumbar arteries)
    - Cauda equina and Conus medullaris: A. Iliaca interna (A. iliolumbalis, A. sacralis medialis)
- Course
    - Departure of the spinal arteries from the respective source vessel
    - Entrance to the spinal canal through the intervertebral foramina
    - Division into ventral A. radicularis anterior and dorsal A. radicularis posterior
    - A. radicularis anterior and posterior each open ventrally and dorsally (T-shaped) into the vertical system
- Supply area: Aa. radiculares lead to the vertical system blood

> [!NOTE]
> Originally, 31 segmental arteries are established – one for each segment. During development, most of these segmental arteries regress, so that the spinal cord is typically supplied by significantly fewer segmental arteries (usually about 6). Often, the lumbosacral cord is supplied by a particularly strong segmental artery, the so-called A. radicularis magna (“Adamkiewicz artery”), which enters the spinal canal in the region of Th9–L1.

#### Vertical System

- Definition: The vertical arterial system lies directly on the spinal cord and supplies it with its capillaries. It primarily receives its blood from the horizontal system.
- Associated vessels
    - Ventral: A. anterior spinal
        - Originating vessels: Vertebral arteries
        - Course
            - Aa. anterior spinal arteries arise in pairs and unite in the area of the 1st-2nd cervical segments.
            - Runs in the anterior median fissure to the filum terminale
        - Supply area: Approximately the ventral ⅔ of the spinal cord
    - Dorsal: Two posterior spinal arteries
        - Origin vessels: Posterior inferior cerebellar arteries
        - Course: From cranial to caudal in each posterolateral sulcus
        - Supply area: Approximately the dorsal ⅓ of the spinal cord

> [!NOTE]
> The vessels of the vertical and horizontal systems anastomose circularly around the spinal cord. In this way, a vascular crown is formed around each spinal cord segment, which is referred to as the "Vasocorona medullaris"!

> [!NOTE] Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome
> The anterior spinal artery supplies the ventral two-thirds of the spinal cord, which is why damage, for example, from a herniated disc or a tumor, affects a variety of spinal cord structures simultaneously. On one hand, the anterior columns are damaged, leading to the loss of temperature and pain sensation. On the other hand, the posterior columns (supplied by the posterior spinal arteries) and thus the fine touch and tactile sensation remain intact, resulting in a so-called dissociated sensory disturbance below the lesion. In addition to the sensory pathways, the motor pathways are also affected. The direct damage to the α-motor neurons in the anterior horns at the level of the lesion leads to a segmental flaccid paresis. The additional damage to the ventral pyramidal tract however leads to a spastic paresis below the lesion and the occurrence of so-called pyramidal tract signs. In addition to the sensory and motor pathways, depending on the level of damage, the lateral horns with their autonomic neurons may also be affected, which can manifest, for example, in a bladder and rectal disorder.

### Venous Outflow

#### Horizontal System

- Associated vessels
    - Radicular vv.
    - Intervertebral discs
- Course: From the vertical system through the intervertebral foramina into the segmentally draining veins
- Drains into: vertebral veins, intercostal veins, lumbar veins, lateral sacral veins, and internal and external vertebral venous plexus

#### Vertical System

- Associated vessels
    - V. anterior spinalis
    - V. spinalis posterior
- History:
    - V. spinalis anterior: From the brainstem veins along the anterior median fissure to the filum terminale
    - V. spinalis posterior: From Vv. radiculares along the Sulcus medianus posterior to the Conus terminalis
- Drained in: Especially the horizontal system

> [!NOTE]
> The anterior spinal vein and the posterior spinal vein form a venous ring around the spinal cord, analogous to the arterial system, which primarily drains into the segmental veins of the horizontal system!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Spinal Cord
What are Renshaw cells, how are they activated, and what function do they serve?
- Renshaw cells belong to the so-called interneurons and are distributed in the gray matter. They are activated by the α-motoneurons via acetylcholine and in turn have an inhibitory effect on the α-motoneurons that innervate them. This negative feedback serves to modulate the activity of the α-motoneurons and is also referred to as "recurrent inhibition."

How is the classification of the gray matter of the spinal cord into the laminae according to Rexed carried out, and which structures are located in laminae VIII–IX accordingly?
- The gray matter of the spinal cord can be divided into ten layers according to Rexed, with the numbering up to lamina IX increasing from dorsal (posterior horn) to ventral (anterior horn). Lamina X lies circularly around the central canal. Since laminae VIII–IX correspond to the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the motor nuclei (motoneurons) of the spinal cord are located here.

What is the so-called conus medullaris, to which nervous system is it counted, and at which level of the vertebrae is it approximately located?
- The conus medullaris refers to the caudal end of the spinal cord. It is counted as part of the central nervous system and is located at the level of the lumbar vertebrae L1–2.

What is the so-called Cauda equina and to which nervous system is it counted?
- The cauda equina ("horse's tail") refers to the nerve fiber plexus below the spinal cord. It consists of the spinal nerve roots of the lower spinal cord segments, which, due to the length difference between the spinal cord and the spine, must first pass through the vertebral canal before uniting at the corresponding vertebral bodies into spinal nerves and exiting. The cauda equina, like the other spinal nerve roots, is counted as part of the peripheral nervous system.
