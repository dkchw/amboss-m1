# Bone Tissue
## Summary

The passive musculoskeletal system of the human body mainly consists of bones and connective tissue structures such as cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. These are moved by the active musculoskeletal system (skeletal muscles). To resist the forces generated during movement, bone tissue is tensile and compressive, but hardly elastic. It is made up of bone cells (osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts) and a specially mineralized extracellular matrix, whose main components are collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals.

The development of a bone begins with a framework that consists either of mesenchymal connective tissue (intramembranous ossification) or cartilage (endochondral ossification). From this, the initially unordered woven bone (only during embryonic development and fracture healing) develops, which is progressively replaced by the denser, layered lamellar bone. Macroscopically, in a lamellar bone, the solid outer cortex (compacta) can be distinguished from the intricately arranged center of bone trabeculae (spongiosa).
## Overview

The stable bone tissue is part of the passive musculoskeletal system and primarily fulfills support and protection functions. In adults, the short and flat bones additionally take on blood-forming functions. Furthermore, due to its extremely high calcium content, bone tissue serves as the body's largest calcium reservoir.

### Functions of the bone

- Support function
- Protective function
- Storage function (calcium reservoir)
- Blood formation

### Sections of a Long Bone

- Epiphysis
    - Proximal or distal end of the long bone, where its trabeculae follow the lines of force
    - In children and adolescents, the length growth of the long bones occurs here (epiphyseal plate)
- Metaphysis: Connects the epiphysis with the diaphysis
- Diaphysis
    - Shaft of the long bone
    - Includes the marrow cavity with the bone marrow
- Apophyse: Larger bone projections where ligaments and tendons attach.

### Bone Types

1. Long bones (RÃ¶hrenknochen)
    - Division into:
        - Long bones (e.g., humerus, radius, femur, tibia)
        - Short tubular bones (e.g., metacarpal bones, metatarsal bones)
2. Short bones (ossa brevia)
    - Examples: Hand and foot bones (carpal bones and tarsal bones)
3. Flat bones (ossa plana)
    - Examples: Shoulder blade (Scapula), breastbone (Sternum), hip bone (Os coxa), and the flat skull bones
4. Pneumatic bones (air-filled bones)
    - Examples: paranasal sinuses, tympanic cavity (Cavum tympani)
5. Irregular bones (irregular; do not correspond to any of the above forms)
    - Example: Vertebral body

## Bone Components

### Overview of Bone Components

All the bones of the human body are made up of the same basic building blocks:

1. Bone matrix, which consists of organic and inorganic components.
2. Bone cells that build up and remodel the bone.
3. Bone coverings that encase the inside and outside of the bone
4. Bone marrow, which is either actively involved in blood formation (red bone marrow) or has mostly been replaced by fat cells (yellow bone marrow)

> [!NOTE]
> The exact composition and organization of the individual bone components differ between the various types of bones and their stages of maturation.

### Bone Ground Substance

1. Organic
    - Collagen (especially Type I)
    - Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans
2. Inorganic
    - Hydroxyapatite
    - Various ions (e.g., magnesium, fluoride)

### Bone Cells

The cells of the bone are located in different areas of the bone and serve various functions. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are primarily responsible for bone formation and remodeling. Osteoclasts, on the other hand, are mainly responsible for the breakdown of bone tissue.

#### Osteoprogenitor cells

- Definition: Poorly differentiated precursor cells of the bone, which originate from the mesenchyme.
- Function: Can differentiate into osteoblasts and replace them
- Localization: Lifelong in bone envelopes (periosteum and endosteum)

#### Osteoblasts

- Definition: Producers of the bone matrix who have not yet been embedded in the bone.
- Functions
    - They produce osteoid (= organic bone matrix) and deposit it in layers on the already existing mineralized matrix.
    - Regulate the mineralization of the osteoid (formation of hydroxylapatite)
        - Process (not fully clarified)
            1. Osteoblasts release vesicles into the extracellular space.
                - Vesicles contain enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase) that increase the local phosphate concentration by cleaving, for example, pyrophosphate.
                - Calcium-binding molecules in the vesicle likely serve as crystallization nuclei.
            2. Formation of the first hydroxyapatite crystals around the crystallization nuclei in the vesicles
            3. Independent growth of the crystals until the vesicle membrane is breached.
            4. Release of the crystals into the extracellular space
            5. Growth of crystals in the extracellular space and deposition on collagen fibrils
    - Regulate bone remodeling
- Localization: Always on the free, bony surface in the bone coverings (periosteum and endosteum)

#### Osteocytes

- Definition: Osteoblasts, on whose "back" a new layer of osteoid has been deposited.
- Function: Likely regulate bone remodeling and prevent excessive bone formation
- Localization: Distributed in the mineralized bone matrix

#### Osteoclasts

- Definition: Multinucleated phagocytic cells that break down mineralized bone and arise from the fusion of monocytes.
- Function: Bone resorption and remodeling
- Localization: Distributed in the bone in Howship lacunae and bone multicellular units

> [!NOTE]
> Build blasts, steal clusters!

### Bone Covers

All surfaces of the bone are covered with bone membranes, except for the joint parts of the bone that are covered with cartilage or synovial membrane. The outer bone surface is covered by the periosteum, while the inner surface is covered by the endosteum.

- Periosteum: Tissue consisting of two layers that covers all outer bone surfaces.
    - Structure
        - Stratum fibrosum: Outer connective tissue layer from which the so-called Sharpey fibers radiate into the bone.
        - Stratum osteogenicum: Inner vascular and nerve-carrying (very pain-sensitive!) layer lined with bone cells
- Endosteum: Bone membrane that covers all internal surfaces of the bone (e.g., trabecular bone or Haversian canals)
    - Structure: Thin (non-mineralized) collagen layer with bordering bone cells

> [!NOTE]
> Periosteum and endosteum contain the same types of lining bone cells!

### Bone Marrow

- Red bone marrow (hematopoietic)
- Yellow bone marrow (fat-storing)

## Levels of Reification and Their Structure

The bones of the human body are initially formed in the form of primary woven bone during embryonic development or fracture healing. Its structure is still very disordered and is transformed into the organized tissue forms of secondary lamellar bone (trabecular and cortical) through continuous remodeling.

### Maturity Stages of Bone

1. Primary bone (= woven bone)
2. Secondary bone (= lamellar bone)

> [!NOTE] "Fractures and fracture healing:"
> When bones are stressed beyond their load limits, they can break, i.e., a fracture occurs. This fracture can heal in two ways: primary fracture healing occurs when the broken ends of the bone are optimally aligned surgically (distance <1 mm). In this case, lamellar bone can be formed directly in the fracture gap (gap healing). On the other hand, secondary fracture healing occurs when the distance between the fracture ends is greater. Initially, the fracture gap is bridged with connective and cartilage tissue (fibrocartilaginous callus), which is gradually converted into woven bone (bony callus) through enchondral ossification over time. Over the course of months, the woven bone is slowly remodeled back into more load-bearing lamellar bone. If this healing process is significantly disrupted by movement of the fracture ends (e.g., insufficient immobilization), it can lead to the formation of a so-called false joint (pseudarthrosis).

> [!NOTE]
> The orientation of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix in bone is an important distinguishing feature between immature woven bone and mature lamellar bone!

### Structure of the Trabecular Bone

Woven bones arise when a large amount of bone substance is formed in a short period of time (e.g., embryonic development, fracture healing). Therefore, they have a less organized extracellular matrix than lamellar bone. This is especially true for the alignment of collagen fibers and blood vessels. In addition, the extracellular matrix of woven bone is also significantly less mineralized.

- Definition: Immature bone that develops through intramembranous or endochondral ossification.
- Histology
    - Disorganized collagen fibers
    - Less mineralized bone substance with higher water content
    - Cell realm
- Origin: During the fetal period (intramembranous ossification, see below) and as part of fracture healing
- Remodeling: Usually occurs after birth (and during secondary fracture healing, see below) gradually transforming into more stable lamellar bone.

### Structure of Lamellar Bone

The lamellar bone consists of the same basic components as woven bone but is significantly more organized. In its center, it mainly consists of the spongy substance, while in its peripheral areas, it is made up of the distinctly denser and harder so-called compact substance.

- Definition: Bone tissue that has developed through the remodeling of woven bone.
- Histology
    - Organization of the extracellular matrix into two tissue forms: spongiosa and compacta
    - Orientation of the collagen fibers along the acting forces
- Origin: Through the remodeling and organization of the primary bone
- Remodeling: Load-dependent, continuous remodeling of the bone according to the acting forces (trajectorial)

#### Tissue types of lamellar bone

1. Spongy substance ("Spongiosa")
    - Definition: Spongy network of thin bony trabeculae inside the lamellar bone
    - Properties
        - Trabeculae align along the greatest compressive and tensile forces (so-called trajectorial alignment)
        - The bone lamellae are aligned parallel to the trabecular surface.
        - Bone marrow is located in the spaces of the spongiosa.
2. Compact substance ("Compacta")
    - Definition: Homogeneous and denser bark layer of the lamellar bone
    - Main building elements
        - Osteon
            - Definition: Concentric bone lamellae with a central Haversian canal
            - Orientation: Several concentric bone lamellae, whose collagen fibers change their orientation from lamella to lamella.
            - Limitation: Is closed off externally by the so-called putty line (= cement line, Linea cementalis)
        - Lamellae: Represent the remnants of partially destroyed osteons and separate the osteons from one another.
        - General lamellae: Provide separation of the compacta outward and inward through one or more layers of bone lamellae.

> [!NOTE]
> Both spongiosa and compacta consist of lamellae, which are arranged differently!

#### Vascularization of the lamellar bone

Since the lamellar bone is a living organ, it must be continuously supplied with blood. This occurs through so-called foramina nutricia, which allow the entry of many vessels (so-called vasa nutricia) into the bone. Within the bone, the larger vessels run either in the center of the osteons in the so-called Havers canals or in vertically oriented connecting channels, the so-called Volkmann canals.

- Bone canals and associated vessels
    1. Havers canal + Havers vessel: Canal in the center of the osteons that contains the namesake vessels for the nourishment of the bone.
    2. Volkmann canal (Perforating canals) + Volkmann vessels: Channels originating from the periosteum that run at right angles to the Haversian vessels with the same name.

> [!NOTE]
> The course of the vessels of lamellar bone is strictly determined by the guiding structures of the Haversian and Volkmann canals. In contrast, the vessels of woven bone run in a "disordered" manner!

## Ossification (Ossification)

Reifer lamellar bone develops through the continuous remodeling of immature woven bone. The latter can arise in two ways: directly from connective tissue (intramembranous ossification) or indirectly from a cartilage model (endochondral ossification). Most bones (such as long tubular bones) develop through endochondral ossification. The exact process and timeline can vary significantly between different bones in the body. In many bones, ossification is not yet complete at the time of birth.

### Overview of Ossification

1. Formation of primary woven bone through:
    - Dismale Ossification
    - Chondral Ossification
2. Remodeling of primary woven bone into secondary lamellar bone

### Types of Ossification

1. Dorsal Ossification
    - Definition: Primary woven bone develops directly from mesenchymal connective tissue.
    - Process
        1. Mesenchymal cells differentiate at the site of bone development (ossification center) into osteoblasts.
        2. Osteoblasts deposit osteoid around themselves â After the mineralization of the osteoid, they become osteocytes â Formation of a bone particle
        3. Osteoblasts on the outside of the bone particle deposit osteoid layers â Appositional growth
        4. Fusion of multiple bone particles to primary spongiosa
        5. Simultaneous build-up and remodeling of bone (woven bone â lamellar bone)
    - Examples: Parts of the skull cap, mandible, maxilla, and clavicle
2. Chondral Ossification
    - Definition: Bone is formed indirectly through the intermediate step of a cartilaginous skeleton from mesenchyme.
    - Process: Mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondroblasts â Formation of a cartilaginous skeleton (primordial skeleton)
    - Types
        - Perichondral ossification: Around the cartilage skeleton
        - Endochondral ossification: Within the cartilage skeleton
    - Examples: Tibia, Femur

> [!NOTE]
> Most bones are formed through chondral ossification!

### The chondral ossification of long bones

Long bones develop through a multi-step process, where ossification begins both within the cartilaginous template (enchondral ossification) and around the cartilaginous template (perichondral ossification) of the bone. Even before birth, the diaphyses of the long bones start to ossify. Only after birth do the epiphyses begin to ossify, with their growth plate (the so-called epiphyseal plate) only ossifying in adolescence. The growth of the cartilage cells in the epiphyseal plate is responsible for the lengthening of the long bones.

#### Overview

1. Long bones ossify in multiple stages through both periosteal and endochondral ossification.
2. Diaphyses begin to ossify during the embryonic period (primary ossification centers).
3. Epiphyses ossify only after birth (secondary ossification centers)

#### Procedure

- Diaphysis
    - Perichondral Ossification
        - Differentiation of chondroblasts from mesenchymal condensations â Construction of a cartilage template with cartilage skin (perichondrium)
        - Osteoblasts arise in the perichondrium and form a bony cuff around the cartilaginous diaphysis (similar to that of intramembranous ossification)
        - Transformation of the perichondrium into periosteum
    - Endochondral Ossification
        - Cartilage cells in the area of the bone cuff become hypertrophic and induce the mineralization of the cartilage matrix.
        - Infiltration of blood vessels and osteoprogenitor cells through channels that osteoclasts erode from the periosteum into the cartilage.
        - Chondroclasts begin to break down cartilage in the center of the developing bone â Formation of the primary medullary cavity
        - Increasing apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes
        - Cartilage matrix serves as a scaffold for osteoblasts/-clasts â The deposition of osteoid layers creates primary spongiosa
        - Process is progressing towards both epiphyses â Two advancing ossification fronts
- Epiphysis (endochondral ossification)
    - Period: Beginning shortly before or after birth
    - Process: Endochondral ossification, similar to the diaphysis
    - Non-ossifying components
        1. Joint surfaces
        2. Epiphyseal plate

## Epiphyseal Plate and Length Growth

The epiphyseal plate is a cartilaginous area that remains between the epiphysis and diaphysis after birth, whose cartilage cells allow the long bones to grow in length through division and hypertrophy.

### Overview of the Length Growth of the Long Bones

- Proliferation of cartilage cells in the epiphyseal plates (proliferation front) â length growth, as the epiphysis "grows away" from the diaphysis.
- Degradation of cartilage tissue and remodeling into bone tissue from the medullary cavity (ossification front)
- Proliferation fronts advance at the same speed as the ossification fronts that follow them.
- Lengthwise growth ends when cartilage cells stop their proliferation and are caught up by the ossification front (â epiphyseal closure)

### Structure of an epiphyseal plate from the epi- to the diaphysis

1. Reservezone
    - Function: Storage of undifferentiated chondrocyte precursors that supplies the proliferation zone with new chondrocytes.
2. Proliferation zone
    - Function: Zone of mitotically active chondrocytes
    - Proliferation process
        - Isogene chondrocytes are arranged in vertical columns on top of each other, but each lies in its own lacuna.
        - Chondrocytes mature from "top to bottom" in the column â Chondrocytes grow larger and produce extracellular matrix.
    - Separation of chondrocytes
        - Transversal septa: Separation from isogenic neighbors
        - Longitudinal septa: Separation from the non-isogenic neighbors
3. Hypertrophy Zone
    - Function: Length growth of cartilage through hypertrophy of chondrocytes
    - Additional features: Hypertrophic chondrocytes produce collagen (Type X) and induce the mineralization of the longitudinal septa.
4. Opening Zone
    - Functions
        - Opening of the cartilage lacunae by removing the transverse septa
        - Apoptosis of hypertrophied chondrocytes
    - Process
        - Secretion of VEGF and matrix metalloproteinases by chondrocytes
        - Blood vessels and macrophages infiltrate â Transverse septa are eroded
    - Result: Mineralized vertical columns remain (ossified longitudinal septa)
        - Only about â of the longitudinal septa are preserved, the rest is broken down by chondroclasts.
5. Ossification zone
    - Colonization of the mineralized longitudinal septa by bone osteoblasts â Formation of osteoid â Mineralization

> [!NOTE] Achondroplasia (formerly also called chondrodystrophy)
> Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder of cartilage formation that leads to dwarfism. The disorder primarily affects the growth plate of long tubular bones, which close prematurely. The resulting lack of length growth leads to dwarfism with a disproportional body stature (e.g., a normal torso with an disproportionately large head and short, stocky limbs).

> [!NOTE] Epiphyseal fracture
> If fractures near the joints occur in childhood or adolescence before the physiological closure of the growth plate, the growth plate can also be damaged. The consequences range from growth disturbances (e.g., asymmetric growth in cases of solely medial/lateral injury to the growth plate) to growth inhibitions and even a complete cessation of growth of the affected bone.

## Bone Remodeling and Its Regulation

The human skeleton is constantly in a dynamic state of construction and destruction (so-called "remodeling"). This applies not only to the replacement of immature woven bone by lamellar bone but also to the functional adaptation of adult bones to their individual loading.

### Bone Remodeling

- Involved cells: Osteoclasts (breakdown) and osteoblasts (building)
- Organization of the cells in
    - Compact substance: Basic Multicellular Units (BMU) = group of osteoclasts that (like a construction crew) together "eat" a drill channel into the compacta. They are followed by osteoblasts, which are responsible for the reconstruction of the bone substance in the drill channel.
    - Substantia spongiosa: Howship-Lakunen = Small depressions (lacunae) on the surface of the spongiosa
        - Formed by osteoclasts that sit on the bone surface and create a sealed lacuna beneath themselves, into which they secrete substances that dissolve the bone.
- Duration of reconstruction: Usually longer than the lifespan of the involved cells â Continuous replacement of involved cells necessary

#### Bone remodeling in the compacta

- Deconstruction
    1. Osteoclasts of the Bone Multicellular Units "ruthlessly" eat away at a "borehole" in the existing compact bone.
    2. Connective tissue, vessels, and unmyelinated nerves sprout into the drill channel.
- Construction
    1. Osteoblasts follow the osteoclasts in the bore canal â deposition of the first osteoid layer in the bore canal
    2. Additional osteoblasts follow and deposit osteoid on the first layer of osteoid â Osteoblasts of the first layer become trapped â They turn into osteocytes
    3. The deposition process repeats until the bore channel is almost filled â Central Haversian canal remains open
    4. Innermost (i.e. the last) generation of osteoblasts is no longer encased â Cells return to a resting state and form endosteum.
    5. Mineralization of the new bone matrix progresses gradually, although the osteon has already been completed.

#### Bone remodeling in the spongiosa

- Deconstruction
    1. Osteoclasts attach to the spongy trabeculae to be resorbed and seal the underlying resorption zone with a sealing ring.
    2. Through carbonic anhydrase, protons are provided from H2CO3; HCO3- is exchanged on the bone-facing side in antiport against chloride ions (HCO3-/Cl--exchanger)
    3. Secretion of chloride ions (passive) and protons (active, via ATPase) into the resorption lacuna (â HCl), creating an acidic environment (approx. pH 4.5) â dissolution of inorganic bone components
    4. Secretion of lysosomal enzymes (especially Cathepsin K and matrix metalloproteinases) â Decomposition of organic bone components
    5. Endo-/transcytosis of bone components
- Construction
    1. Filling of the holes by groups of osteoblasts â Are enclosed under each lamella (and from this point on are called osteocytes)
    2. The last group of osteoblasts remains (as with the compact bone) as part of the endosteum on the bone surface.

### Regulation of Bone Remodeling

The bone is continuously remodeled, and this remodeling must be very precisely controlled. At the molecular level, the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts is primarily regulated. This occurs through a variety of different factors.

- Important mechanisms for the regulation of bone remodeling
    - Mechanical Load
        - Bone loading leads to an increase in bone mass.
        - Lack of weight-bearing (e.g., due to bed rest) leads to a decrease in bone mass
    - RANK (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-ÎºB): Receptor on osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors for interaction with osteoblasts
    - RANKL (Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-ÎºB Ligand)
        - Membrane-bound protein of osteoblasts that interacts with RANK of the osteoclast.
        - Ensures fusion and differentiation into activated osteoclasts and prevents their apoptosis.
    - Osteoprotegerin (OPG): Protein secreted by osteoblasts â Binds to RANKL and prevents its action â Acts as a counter-regulation to the RANK/RANKL system
    - M-CSF (= Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor): Secreted by osteoblasts â Promotes proliferation of osteoclast precursors
    - Negative feedback through osteoclasts: Growth factors are embedded in the bone matrix and are released during resorption by osteoclasts â Stimulate osteoblasts
    - Hormone: PTH, Calcitriol, Sex hormones (especially Estrogen!)

> [!NOTE]
> Estrogens have a positive effect on bone balance in both sexes, as they inhibit the formation and activation of osteoclasts (i.e., the RANKL effect) on one hand and increase the formation of OPG on the other!

> [!NOTE] Osteoporosis and Bisphosphonates
> If the balance of bone remodeling is negative, meaning more bone is being resorbed than formed, this leads to a decrease in bone mass and changes in the trabecular architecture over time. This condition, referred to as "osteoporosis," increases the susceptibility of bones to fractures. A common cause is often estrogen deficiency, which can occur in women after menopause and in older men. A frequently used group of medications for the treatment of osteoporosis are the so-called bisphosphonates. They incorporate into the bone substance and are taken up by osteoclasts during bone resorption. By taking bisphosphonates, osteoclasts (and thus bone resorption) are inhibited.

> [!NOTE] Osteomalacia and rickets
> If mineralization, i.e., the incorporation of calcium and phosphate into the bones, is impaired, it is referred to as osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. The cause is often a vitamin D deficiency due to insufficient intake or inadequate production (e.g., due to lack of sun exposure). The lack of mineralization reduces the stability of the bones and often leads patients first to bone pain, then to deformity (bending of the bones), and finally to pathological fractures.

> [!NOTE] Paget's disease
> Paget's disease describes the condition of abnormally increased bone remodeling, where high-quality secondary lamellar bone is replaced by inferior primary woven bone. Since woven bone does not possess the excellent mechanical properties of lamellar bone, affected individuals may experience bone pain, skeletal deformities, and even pathological fractures. The cause of this disease is still not understood. Therefore, it is only treated symptomatically with painkillers (e.g., NSAIDs) and "osteoclast activity inhibitors" (bisphosphonates).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Bone Tissue
### Bone Components

How is the bone matrix structured?
- The bone matrix has organic and inorganic components. The organic part contains collagens (mainly type I), glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, whereas the inorganic part mainly consists of hydroxyapatite and various other ions.

### Levels of Refinement and Their Structure

What are the two macroscopically distinguishable tissue types that make up lamellar bone?
- Lamellar bone consists of substantia spongiosa and substantia compacta.

Describe the histological structure of the compact substance of a lamellar bone!
- The compacta can be recognized histologically, among other things, by the bone matrix arranged in lamellae. Concentric bone lamellae with a central Haversian canal are called osteons. Among the flat osteocytes layered between the lamellae, usually only the cell nucleus can be seen.

### Ossification (Ossification)

How does the endochondral ossification of the diaphyses of long bones begin?
- Endochondral ossification takes place within the cartilage skeleton.
- In the diaphysis, the cartilage cells in the area of the previously formed bone collar first hypertrophy and cause mineralization of the cartilage matrix.

### Epiphyseal Plate and Length Growth

What characteristic zones can be found in the histological section of an epiphyseal plate?
- In a growing long bone, the epiphyseal plate contains the following zones: 1. reserve zone, 2. proliferation zone, 3. hypertrophic zone, 4. opening zone, and 5. ossification zone.

What is the function of the hypertrophic zone of the epiphyseal plate?
- In the hypertrophic zone of the epiphyseal plate, chondrocytes hypertrophy as part of endochondral ossification and thus contribute to the longitudinal growth of the bone.

In which zone of the epiphyseal plate can mitotically active chondrocytes be found?
- Mitotically active, i.e., dividing chondrocytes, are found in the so-called proliferation zone of the epiphyseal plate.

What is the role of the chondroclasts in the opening zone?
- The chondroclasts of the opening zone of the epiphyseal plate break down about two-thirds of the longitudinal septa. In this way, the primary marrow cavity is formed.

### Bone Remodeling and Its Regulation

Which cells are involved in the remodeling of bone?
- Osteoblasts build bone tissue, osteoclasts break down bone tissue.

Which enzyme plays a crucial role in the breakdown of organic bone components?
- The lysosomal enzyme cathepsin K is secreted by osteoclasts into the resorption lacuna and breaks down organic bone components.

What role do the surface proteins RANK and RANKL play in the regulation of bone remodeling?
- Osteoclasts and osteoclast precursor cells have a surface protein on their cell membrane (RANK) that can bind the surface protein RANKL on the cell membrane of osteoblasts. This leads to the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts. RANKL is also expressed by osteocytes, which presumably play an important role in bone remodeling.
