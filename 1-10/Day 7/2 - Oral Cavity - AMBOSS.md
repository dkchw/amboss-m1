# Oral Cavity
## Summary

The oral cavity is the starting area of the air and food passage. It houses the chewing apparatus (teeth, tongue) and prepares food for its passage into the stomach. In addition to the chewing apparatus, the salivary glands that open into the oral cavity also play an important role in the initial processing of food, as the saliva they produce begins the digestion of food components and makes the food slippery. The oral cavity transitions at the esophageal opening into the pharynx, which extends to the esophagus and the trachea.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Structure

The oral cavity is divided into the vestibule (Vestibulum oris) and the actual oral cavity (Cavitas oris propria). The vestibule refers to the area between the cheeks, lips, and teeth. Several salivary glands (parotid gland, buccal glands, and labial glands) drain into it. The actual oral cavity extends from the teeth to the pharyngeal opening. Its roof is formed by the hard and soft palate, while its floor is formed by the tongue and the floor of the mouth.

#### Lips (Labia oris)

The lips are divided into a lower lip (labium inferius) and an upper lip (labium superius). The lower lip is smooth, whereas the upper lip has a depression (philtrum). The small medial mucosal fold between the upper and lower lip and the gingiva is called the upper or lower labial frenum (frenulum labii superioris or inferioris). The transition between the lip mucosa and facial skin is referred to as vermilion.

- Muscular basis: M. orbicularis oris

#### Cheeks (Buccae)

- Muscular Foundation: M. buccinator
    - Raphe pterygomandibularis: Tendinous plate that connects the M. buccinator with the M. constrictor pharyngis superior (pharyngeal muscle).

#### Palate (Palatum)

- Hard palate (Palatum durum): Incisive bone, Maxilla and Palatine bone
- Soft palate (Palatum molle): Movable muscle plate

#### Soil

As the floor of the mouth (diaphragm of the mouth), one refers to the mylohyoid muscle and all associated muscles. This thus refers to the area between the lower jaw bones and the hyoid bone.

- Musculature of the floor of the mouth (so-called suprahyoid musculature)
    - M. mylohyoideus
    - M. geniohyoideus
    - M. digastricus
    - M. stylohyoideus
- Mouths
    - Sublingual gland
    - Submandibular gland

#### Palate Arches

The palate forms the transition from the oral cavity to the pharynx.

- Anterior palatine arch: M. palatoglossus
    - Course: From the soft palate to the base of the tongue
- Posterior palatine arch: M. palatopharyngeus
    - Course: From the Soft Palate to the Pharynx

#### Schlundenge (Isthmus of the fauces)

- Definition: Narrowing at the transition from the oral cavity (Cavum oris) to the oral part of the pharynx of the pharynx
- Components: Base of the tongue, soft palate with uvula, Palatine arches, tonsillar fossa and Passavant's ridge of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle

### Topography

The vestibule is closed off in front by the lips. Behind the teeth begins the actual oral cavity, which is also connected to the vestibule even when the dental arches are closed. The oropharynx connects to the oral cavity as a transition to the pharynx.

## Microscopic Anatomy

The mucous membrane of the oral cavity consists of stratified squamous epithelium, which is keratinized or non-keratinized depending on the region and function. The squamous epithelium also contains non-epithelial cells (melanocytes, dendritic cells, and Merkel cells). Additionally, the mucous membrane has a lamina propria with connective tissue and defense cells, as well as a submucosa with salivary glands.

- General mucosal types
    - Masticatory mucosa: Gums, hard palate
        - Stratified Keratinized Squamous Epithelium
        - Unmovable mucous membrane
    - Lining mucosa: Lips, Cheeks, Floor of the mouth, Soft palate
        - Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
        - Movable mucosa

## Function

In the oral cavity, the first processing of food takes place. The teeth chew it, the tongue rubs the food into smaller pieces, and the enzymes from the salivary glands begin to digest the food. Additionally, the lips, tongue, teeth, and palate play an important role in speech formation. Furthermore, the palate has a valve function between the air and food pathways.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Oral Cavity
How are the lips motorically and sensibly innervated?
- The muscular basis of the lips is formed by the M. orbicularis oris, which is innervated by the N. facialis. The sensory innervation differs between the upper and lower lip: the lower lip is innervated by the N. mentalis from the N. mandibularis, while the upper lip is innervated by the N. infraorbitalis from the N. maxillaris.

Describe the especially relevant sensitive innervation of the palate and the gingiva for dentistry!
- The sensory innervation of the palate and the gingiva in the region of the incisors is provided by the N. nasopalatinus (from the N. maxillaris), the hard palate and the anterior part of the soft palate are supplied by the N. palatinus major (also from the N. maxillaris), and the posterior soft palate is innervated by the Nn. palatini minores from the Ganglion pterygopalatinum.

How is the lip mucosa microscopically structured?
- The lips consist on the side facing the mouth of stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium and contain Glandulae labiales. The vermilion border is the gland-free transition zone between the non-keratinized lip mucosa and the keratinized facial skin. It consists of only weakly keratinized squamous epithelium, into which connective tissue papillae protrude, whose numerous capillaries shine through and thus cause the typical red lip color.
