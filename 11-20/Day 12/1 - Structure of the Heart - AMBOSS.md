# Structure of the Heart
## Summary

The heart is a muscular tube located in the middle section of the lower mediastinum in the chest. It is surrounded by the pericardium and is divided into two chambers (ventricles) and two atria (auricles). This complex shape develops embryonically through a sequence of three-dimensional folding and septation processes. The heart's task is, on one hand, to pump deoxygenated (venous) blood to the lungs and, on the other hand, to pump oxygenated (arterial) blood into the systemic circulation. To direct the blood flow in one direction, the heart has valves that function as gates. While the large vessels of the heart are separated from the heart by pocket valves, the atrioventricular valves create the separation between the atria and the ventricles.

To avoid turbulence in blood flow, the heart, similar to vessels in general, is lined with a smooth inner layer (endocardium). This is followed by several thick layers of muscle (myocardium) composed of specialized heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) that are responsible for the actual contraction movements. To allow for smooth expansion and contraction of the heart within the pericardial sac, it is covered with a similarly smooth outer layer (epicardium).

The topics of cardiac excitation and heart mechanics are addressed separately in the respective chapters of the same name.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

The heart, with its two chambers and two atria, connects the two major circulatory systems of the body: the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation. Four valves, the heart valves, ensure that blood flows in the same direction through the heart. The heart valves are anchored in the heart skeleton. In addition, there are numerous other structures within the heart, some of which are functionally significant only during embryonic or fetal development.

### Profile

- Location: Intrathoracic, in the middle section of the lower mediastinum (mediastinum medium)
- Form: Bulbous Cone Shape
- Size: About fist-sized
- Weight: 300–500 g

### Heart Surfaces

When viewing the heart from the outside, one distinguishes three different surfaces: sternocostal surface, posterior surface, and diaphragmatic surface.

- Sternocostal surface of the heart
    - Definition: Anterior surface of the heart
    - Shares
        - Mainly right ventricle
        - Left Ventricle
        - Right and left atrium (auricles)
    - Significant structure: Anterior interventricular sulcus
- Posterior surface of the heart
    - Definition: Posterior surface of the heart
    - Shares
        - Left Ventricle
        - Right and left atrium
    - Significant structure: Coronary sulcus of the heart
- Diaphragmatic surface of the heart
    - Definition: Undersurface of the heart
    - Shares
        - Mainly left ventricle
        - Right Ventricle
        - Right and left atrium
    - Significant Structures
        - Coronary sulcus of the heart
        - Posterior interventricular sulcus

> [!NOTE]
> The right ventricle is located the farthest ventrally and the left atrium is located the farthest dorsally!

> [!NOTE] Echocardiography
> As echocardiography, the ultrasound examination of the heart is referred to. In most cases, this non-invasive procedure is performed using an ultrasound probe placed on the chest (transthoracic echocardiography). In transesophageal echocardiography (“swallow echo”), the ultrasound examination of the heart is conducted using an ultrasound probe inserted into the esophagus. The transducer is located closer to the heart, allowing for a more precise examination of the heart. Since the left atrium is positioned the farthest dorsally and thus in immediate proximity to the esophagus, it is particularly well visualized in transesophageal echocardiography.

> [!NOTE]
> In clinical terminology, the term "posterior wall" is often used when referring to the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. Anatomically, however, this is confusing, as it is not the back, but the underside of the heart. Therefore, more precise terms such as inferior posterior wall (for the diaphragmatic surface) and posterior wall (for the posterior surface) are more accurate.

### Heart cavities and their blood flow

The heart consists of two chambers (left ventricle and right ventricle) and two atria (left atrium and right atrium). The two chambers are separated by the interventricular septum and the two atria are separated by the interatrial septum. The two atria have protrusions that embrace the large vessel trunks of the heart, known as the auricles (left auricle and right auricle).

The veins of the body carry blood to the right atrium, which pumps the blood through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. This chamber sends the blood through the pulmonary circulation, where it gets enriched with oxygen. The blood then collects in the left atrium, which directs it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. This chamber pumps the blood into the systemic circulation. The left ventricle is subjected to significantly higher pressures than the right and therefore has a stronger muscle layer.

1. Pulmonary circulation
    - Right Atrium → Tricuspid Valve → Right Ventricle → Pulmonary Valve → Pulmonary Trunk → Pulmonary Arteries → Lung → Pulmonary Veins → Left Atrium
2. Circulatory System
    - Left Atrium → Mitral Valve → Left Ventricle → Aortic Valve → Aorta → Systemic Circulation (Capillary Bed) → Inferior/Superior Vena Cava → Right Atrium

### Heart Valves

#### Sail Flaps

1. Tricuspid valve: Three-leaflet valve between the right atrium and right ventricle
2. Bicuspid/Mitral valve: Two-leaflet valve between the left atrium and left ventricle.

- Location: Between the atrium and the ventricle
- Structure: Consists of two to three sails → Are connected by so-called chordae tendineae with papillary muscles of the heart wall.

#### Pocket Flaps

1. Pulmonary valve: pocket valve between the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk
2. Aortic valve: pocket valve between the left ventricle and the aorta

- Location: Between the ventricle and the systemic or pulmonary circulation
- Structure: Composed of three crescent-shaped pockets (semilunar valves) → Do not possess tendon fibers (in contrast to the atrioventricular valves)

> [!NOTE]
> All flaps close and open passively due to the different pressure conditions on their surrounding sides!

> [!NOTE]
> The THREE-leafed tricuspid valve is located on the right – just like the THREE-lobed lung. The TWO-leafed mitral valve is located on the left – just like the TWO-lobed lung!

> [!NOTE] Heart valve diseases
> If the heart valves are damaged, for example, in the context of infections or heart attacks, this manifests as a narrowing of the opening area (stenosis), a leakage of the valve with backflow (insufficiency), or a combination of both. The type of heart valve disease determines the nature of the cardiac strain: stenoses lead to pressure load, whereas insufficiencies, due to the so-called pendulum volume, lead to a volume load of the upstream heart chambers. Usually, the valves of the left heart are affected, as the mechanical load is greater due to the higher pressure in the left ventricle. When blood flows through damaged heart valves, characteristic heart sounds are generated, which can be auscultated at typical points on the chest (see: Heart mechanics - heart tones and sounds).

> [!NOTE] Aortic valve insufficiency
> If the aortic valve does not close properly during diastole, leading to a backflow into the left ventricle, this is referred to as aortic valve insufficiency. Due to the backflow from the aorta into the ventricle, the left ventricle is burdened with additional blood volume, which it cannot fully compensate for. As a result, both in diastole and systole, more blood remains in the left ventricle (increased end-systolic and end-diastolic volume). The backflow through the leaking valve continues to cause turbulence in the blood flow, which can be heard as heart murmurs at the auscultation site of the aortic valve (2nd intercostal space, parasternal right) throughout diastole. Additionally, a large blood pressure amplitude is clinically noticeable. In the long term, the heart muscle attempts to compensate for this volume overload through a so-called (eccentric) volume hypertrophy. Initially, it manages this very well, which is why patients with chronic aortic valve insufficiency remain symptom-free for a long time.

> [!NOTE] Echocardiography in Mitral Valve Stenosis
> Normally, the pressure difference between the left atrium and the left ventricle during the filling phase is relatively low (<7 mmHg). However, if the opening area of the mitral valve is pathologically reduced (so-called mitral valve stenosis), the blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle is reduced, and blood "backs up" in the atrium before the mitral valve. This causes the pressure in the atrium to rise. With the help of echocardiography, these characteristic pathophysiological changes in the heart can be measured: on one hand, the decreased opening area of the mitral valve and on the other hand, the increased pressure difference between the left atrium and the left ventricle can be determined. Based on these parameters, the severity and progression of a mitral valve stenosis can be assessed.

### Flap-relevant Structures

#### Valve plane or flap plane

- Definition: Thought level in the heart where all the flaps lie.
- Function: The passive upward and downward movement of the valve plane during the contraction process of the heart creates a suction effect on the veins close to the heart, which significantly contributes to the diastolic filling of the heart (so-called valve plane mechanism)

#### Heart Skeleton

- Definition: Connective tissue layer that lies between the atria and the ventricles in the valve plane and surrounds the heart valves with collagen fiber rings (Anuli fibrosi)
- Construction
    - Anulus fibrosus sinister: Surrounds the mitral valve
    - Anulus fibrosus dexter: Surrounds the tricuspid valve
    - Aortic ring: Surrounds the aortic valve
    - Anulus trunci pulmonalis: Surrounds the pulmonary valve
    - Right fibrous triangle and left fibrous triangle: Connective tissue triangles between the fibrous rings
- Functions
    - Electrical insulation layer between atria and chambers → Cardiac excitation can only spread through the heart's specialized conduction system.
    - Attachment of the flaps

### Vegetative Innervation and the Excitation Formation and Conduction System of the Heart

#### Excitation Formation and Conduction System

The heart's excitation formation and conduction system consists of specialized heart muscle cells that are capable of generating autonomous excitations as well as coordinating these excitations to the working myocardium cells (see: excitation formation and conduction system).

#### Vegetative Innervation of the Heart

The heart action is influenced by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems – however, the parasympathetic nervous system only acts on the atria (via fibers of the vagus nerve), in contrast to the sympathetic nervous system. Both vegetative nervous systems project into the so-called cardiac plexus at the heart, which can be divided into a superficial and a deep plexus component. Beginning at the base of the heart, the cardiac plexus runs roughly alongside the coronary vessels. See: Autonomic Nervous System of the Heart.

## Vascular Supply of the Heart

The large vessels of the heart are essential for the transport of blood in the two circulations, but they do not supply the heart itself with oxygen and nutrients (Vasa publica). The heart is supplied by a left and a right coronary artery (Vasa privata). The majority of the venous blood then flows into the right atrium via the sinus coronary system.

### Arterial Supply

The heart is supplied with blood through the two coronary arteries (right coronary artery and left coronary artery).

#### Right coronary artery (arteria coronaria dextra)

- Supply areas (according to standard supply type)
    - Right atrium
    - Large parts of the right ventricle
    - Parts of the left ventricle (diaphragmatic surface of the heart)
    - About ⅓ of the ventricular septum
    - Sinoatrial and AV node
- Progress
    - Branches off from the aorta (directly above the aortic valve)
    - Runs beneath the right auricle in the coronary sulcus to the diaphragmatic surface of the heart
    - Often transitions into the R. interventricularis posterior there
- Departures over the course
    - Arterial coni rr.
    - R. nodi sinuatrialis ("Sinus node branch")
    - R. atrialis dexter and R. atrioventricularis dexter
    - R. marginalis dexter
    - R. posterolateral right
    - R. nodi atrioventricularis ("AV node branch")
    - R. posterior interventricular
        - Rr. interventricular septal ("ventricular septal branches")

> [!NOTE]
> Typically, the right coronary artery supplies the important pacemaker centers of the heart (sinoatrial and AV nodes), so that a narrowing of this vessel can lead to heart rhythm disturbances!

#### Left coronary artery (linke Koronararterie)

- Supply areas (according to standard supply type)
    - Left Atrium
    - Large parts of the left ventricle
    - Parts of the right ventricle (sternocostal surface of the heart)
    - About ⅔ of the ventricular septum
- Course
    - Branches off from the aorta (directly above the aortic valve)
    - Already splits into two main branches after a short course.
        1. R. circumflexus: Runs below the left atrial appendage in the coronary sulcus to the diaphragmatic surface of the heart.
        2. R. anterior interventricular: Runs in the anterior interventricular sulcus towards the apex of the heart.
- Departures over the course
    - R. interventricularis anterior (clinically often referred to as "RIVA" or "LAD")
        - Arterial coni
        - R. lateralis (clinically often R. diagonalis)
        - Rr. interventricular septal ("ventricular septal branches")
    - R. circumflexus (clinically often "RCX")
        - Left atrial appendage
        - Left atrioventricular valve
        - R. marginalis sinister
        - R. posterior of the left ventricle (often clinically referred to as R. posterolateral left)

> [!NOTE]
> The coronary arteries are classified as so-called functional end arteries. Accordingly, they are interconnected by anastomoses; however, these are not sufficient to ensure blood supply in the event of an acute occlusion of a coronary artery.

### Venous Outflow

The venous blood of the heart flows approximately ¾ through epicardial veins via the coronary sinus into the right atrium and about ¼ through trans- and endomyocardial veins directly into the atria and chambers. The cardiac veins that are part of the coronary sinus system predominantly run together with the coronary arteries.

#### Sinus Coronary System

- Coronary sinus
    - Runs in the coronary sulcus on the posterior surface of the heart
    - Drains into the right atrium (near the opening of the inferior vena cava)
- The following veins drain into the coronary sinus:
    1. V. cardiaca magna: Drains blood from the supply area of the left coronary artery.
        - V. anterior interventricular
        - V. marginalis sinistra
        - V. left posterior ventricle
    2. V. cardiaca media: Runs in the posterior interventricular sulcus.
    3. V. cardiaca parva: Runs in the posterior section of the right coronary sulcus.
    4. V. obliqua of the left atrium: Runs along the back of the left atrium.

#### Trans- and Endomural System

- Transmural System: Veins of the heart surface that drain directly into the right or left atrium.
    - Associated veins
        - Anterior walls of the right ventricle
        - Atrial vv.
- Endomural System (Vasa Thebesii): Smallest arteries and veins of the inner myocardium layer, which open directly into the atria and ventricles.
    - Associated veins: Vv. cardiacae minimae (Thebesian veins)

### Supply Types

Depending on which of the two coronary arteries is more pronounced, a normal type is distinguished from a right and left supply type.

- Normal supply type
    - Vessel course: "Normal" (see above)
    - Frequency: Approx. 55%
- Legal service type
    - Vessel course: Right coronary artery more pronounced → Supplies up to ⅔ of the ventricular septum and replaces posterior portions of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery.
    - Frequency: Approx. 25%
- Link supply type
    - Vessel course: The left coronary artery gives off (in addition to the anterior interventricular branch) the posterior interventricular branch → Supplies the left ventricle, parts of the right ventricle, and the entire interventricular septum
    - Frequency: Approx. 20%

### Physiological Peculiarities of Coronary Blood Flow

Similar to the skeletal musculature, the myocardium consumes significantly more oxygen and energy substrates under stress. However, it exhibits some peculiarities: Even under resting conditions, the oxygen extraction in coronary blood is very high – thus, there is only a small reserve available to meet the increased demand. Further details on myocardial metabolism will be presented in the chapter on performance physiology and aging.

- Normal values
    - O2 consumption: Approx. 10 mL O2/min/100 g tissue
    - Organ perfusion: Approx. 70–80 mL/min/100 g of tissue (corresponds to approx. 5% of cardiac output)
- Resting situation
    - Oxygen extraction in the coronary circulation is already very high (60-70%) and hardly increaseable, which is why blood flow must be adjusted with increasing demand.
    - Pressure on the myocardial supply vessels during systole is high (especially in the area of the left ventricle), which is why left ventricular perfusion primarily occurs in early diastole.
        - A. coronaria dextra: Blood flow approximately corresponds to the course of aortic pressure.
        - A. coronaria sinistra: Minimal inflow during systole (even backflow into the aorta during the isometric contraction phase), blood flow primarily occurs in diastole.
        - Coronary sinus: Significant increase in blood flow during systole (especially due to drainage of the left ventricular vessels)
    - Subendocardial myocardial areas are compressed more strongly during systole than subepicardial myocardial areas (transmural gradient)
- "Stress situation": Vasodilation of the coronary arteries → Increase in coronary blood flow (by a factor of 4–5) = Coronary reserve

> [!NOTE]
> With an increase in heart rate, for example during physical exertion, the diastolic duration is primarily shortened, and accordingly the time for coronary circulation!

> [!NOTE] Coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction
> Coronary artery disease (CAD) refers to a narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by atherosclerosis, which can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle. A myocardial infarction (heart attack) occurs when heart muscle tissue dies. The most common cause of this is CAD. If an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures, a coronary artery can suddenly become completely blocked, causing the section of heart muscle it supplies to become ischemic and die. In industrialized nations, CAD, including myocardial infarction, is one of the leading causes of death overall.

> [!NOTE] Diagnosis of myocardial infarction
> The diagnosis of a heart attack is essentially based on three points: the clinical presentation of the patients, the electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory diagnostics.

- Clinical leading symptom: Angina pectoris (possible additional symptoms: shortness of breath, anxiety, nausea)
- EKG: Signs of ischemia, especially so-called ST-segment elevations
- Laboratory Diagnostics
    - Troponin I/T
    - Creatine kinase (CK), especially the heart muscle-specific isoform CK-MB

## Microscopic Anatomy

The heart and the vessels form a functional unit. Both share a three-layered wall structure, where the endocardium corresponds to the tunica intima, the myocardium to the tunica media, and the epicardium to the tunica externa (see also: structure of large vessels).

### Endocard (Endocardium)

- Definition: A layer consisting of endothelium and connective tissue, which lines the inner surfaces of the heart and transitions into the intima of the heart-adjacent vessels.
- Function: Ensures a smooth and low-turbulence blood flow
- Structure (from inside to outside)
    - Epithelial layer (Single layer of endothelial cells)
    - Lamina propria
        - Subendothelial stratum
        - Myoelastic layer

> [!NOTE]
> The sails and pockets of the heart valves are formed by duplications of the endocardium and are so thin that they are largely free of blood vessels and are supplied directly from the bloodstream!

> [!NOTE] Infective Endocarditis
> In the context of bacterial infections or unsterile injections (e.g., in intravenous drug abuse), if there is a colonization of germs on the innermost layer of the heart, this is referred to as (infectious) endocarditis. This primarily affects the heart valves. These valve inflammations can lead to direct valve damage as well as to accumulations of infectious material that can dislodge and be carried into organs by the bloodstream. These fragments often "block" small organ vessels, which is referred to as septic microemboli. The risk of a bacterial infection is higher with damaged valves than with healthy valves. Since the mitral valve is most frequently affected by such damage, it is also most commonly affected by bacterial endocarditis. Interestingly, in intravenous drug abuse, it is rather the tricuspid valve that is affected, as the concentration of bacteria is highest there during an unsterile venous injection. Since bacteria are usually the cause of infectious endocarditis, it should be treated with antibiotics.

### Myocardium

The myocardium forms the actual heart muscle. The basic structure of a heart muscle cell is very similar to that of a skeletal muscle cell, with some functionally significant differences (see: muscle tissue).

- Definition: Functional unit (functional syncytium) of cardiomyocytes, whose muscle chains extend in several layers through the atria and ventricles.
- Function: Implementation of the electrical excitations of the excitation formation and conduction system into a coordinated mechanical muscle contraction to transport blood in the circulation.
- Special structures of the myocardium
    - Cardiomyocytes
        - Definition: Heart muscle cells that are mechanically and functionally connected to each other by so-called intercalated discs to form long "chains."
        - Histological characteristics
            - Uninucleate cells with a central nucleus
            - Myofibril-free areas
            - Particularly many mitochondria
        - Endocrine activity: Atrial cardiomyocytes secrete the so-called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in response to increased stretching → Increased NaCl and water excretion through the kidneys.
        - Special case: Purkinje fibers
            - Specialized cardiomyocytes of the excitation-conduction system of the heart that transmit the excitation to the working myocardium.
            - Rather myofibrillar and rich in mitochondria and glycogen → Light microscopically pale (due to the high glycogen content)
            - Location: Between the endocardium and myocardium in the subendocardial layer
    - Glossy stripes (Intercalary discs)
        - Definition: Mechanical and functional interfaces of cardiomyocytes with each other
        - Built from
            1. Communication contacts
                - Gap Junctions (conducting at different speeds)
            2. Adhesion contacts (serve for the transmission of mechanical tensile forces)
                - Adherens junctions (adhesion contacts with incoming actin filaments)
                - Desmosomes
    - Diade: Pair of a terminal cistern of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and a T-tubule

### Epicardium

- Definition: The layer lying on the outside of the myocardium, which also represents the visceral layer of the pericardium.
- Function
    - Ensures a low-friction surface in the pericardium
    - Allows limited elastic adjustment to changes in the volume of the heart
- Structure (from outside to inside)
    - Serous tunic
        - Serous epithelial layer (Mesothelium)
        - Serous lamina propria
    - Subserosal tissue

## Heart Sac (Pericardium)

The heart and the heart-adjacent vessels are surrounded by the pericardium. This protects the heart from overstretching and serves as an infection barrier. The pericardium consists of two parts: an outer fibrous layer (pericardium fibrosum) and an inner serous layer (pericardium serosum), which in turn consists of two layers. Between the two serous layers (lamina visceralis and lamina parietalis) lies the fluid-filled pericardial cavity, which ensures a low-friction movement of the heart within the pericardium. The two layers of the pericardium serosum fold around the major vessels and merge into each other, creating blind-ending "cul-de-sacs" (sinus transversus pericardii and sinus obliquus pericardii).

### Structure (from inside to outside)

1. Serous pericardium
    - Visceral layer
        - Lies directly on the heart; is also called the epicardium.
        - Firmly fused with the myocardium
    - Pericardial cavity (heart sac cavity, Cavitas pericardiaca)
        - Space between the visceral layer and the parietal layer of the serous pericardium
        - Contains a fluid film (10–15 mL) called pericardial fluid
        - Ensures smooth movements of the heart
    - Parietal layer
        - It passes over to the lamina visceralis at the large vessels and covers parts of the aorta and pulmonary trunk.
        - Firmly fused with the fibrous pericardium
2. Fibrous pericardium
    - External, fibrous layer of the pericardium
    - Mesh-like arranged collagen fibers → Limited stretchability, while simultaneously protecting against overstretching
    - Mountings in the area
        - Caudal: Central tendon of the diaphragm (Phrenicopericardiac ligaments)
        - Dorsal: Trachea and diaphragm (bronchopericardial membrane)
        - Ventral: Sternum (Lig. sternopericardiaca)
        - Cranial: Covers parts of the aorta and pulmonary trunk

> [!NOTE] Pericarditis
> An inflammation of the pericardium (e.g., as part of an infection) is referred to as pericarditis. Due to its proximity to the heart muscle, this can often also be involved, in which case it is referred to as myopericarditis. In pericarditis, fluid can accumulate in the pericardial sac and constrict the heart due to the limited stretchability of the pericardium, leading to acute heart failure. This phenomenon is also known as pericardial tamponade: the heart cannot adequately fill with blood, causing blood to back up in front of the heart, while also reducing the ejection performance due to the low filling. Therapeutically, the underlying condition (e.g., the infection) can be treated, or in emergencies, the pressure in the pericardial sac can be reduced using a puncture.

### "Sinus" of the pericardium

At the fold of the visceral into the parietal pericardium, two blind-ending "sinuses" are formed: the transverse sinus of the pericardium and the oblique sinus of the pericardium.

- Transverse sinus of the pericardium: Runs horizontally between the outflow (aorta and pulmonary trunk) and inflow vessels (superior vena cava and pulmonary veins) on the back of the atria.
- Oblique sinus of the pericardium: Is located on the back of the left atrium between the right and left pulmonary veins.

## Random-forming Structures in X-ray Images

An X-ray of the thorax is one of the standard examinations in clinical practice. The silhouette of the heart is determined by different structures depending on the direction of the radiation.

## Development

By the middle of the 3rd week of development, a primitive heart structure forms in the cranial part of the embryo (in the so-called cardiogenic zone, centrally in front of the prechordal plate and neural plate) from blood and endothelial cells. From this, two horseshoe-shaped endocardial tubes initially arise during the lateral folding and cranio-caudal folding of the embryo, and after their fusion, a X-shaped heart tube is formed. This is subsequently surrounded by myocardium. Following this, the so-called heart loop is created through rapid length growth and curvature of the heart tube in the confined space of the primary pericardial cavity. Through further twisting and septation into individual sections, the later heart with its atria, chambers, and vessels ultimately develops from this.

### Formation of the Heart Tube and Pericardial Cavity

- Period: 18th to 22nd day
- Starting point: The embryo is still disk-shaped.
- Goal: Development of a heart tube from two individual vascular tubes (so-called endocardial tubes)
- Development steps
    - Formation of the so-called cardiogenic plate from mesenchymal cells within the cardiogenic zone
    - Formation of the horseshoe-shaped endocardial tubes on both sides from the vascular plexus of the cardiogenic plate
    - Endocardial tubes from both sides meet through the lateral folding of the embryonic "disk"
    - Endocardial tubes fuse in the middle (X-shaped) to form the three-part so-called heart tube with the following components (from cranial to caudal)
1. Bulbus cordis: Outflow segment with three parts (from cranial to caudal)
            - Truncus arteriosus
            - Arterial cone
            - Caudal part of the bulbus cordis
        2. Primitive Ventricle: Ejection Segment
        3. Primitives atrium and sinus venosus (see below): inflow segment
- The heart tube is surrounded by myocardial cells.
- Parallel to the development of the heart tube, the primary pericardial cavity is formed by fissure formation in the mesodermal tissue ventrally and laterally of the cardiogenic zone.

### Formation of the Heart Loop from the Heart Tube

- Period: 4th Development Week
- Starting point: The heart is still tubular (the so-called heart tube in three parts)
- Goal: Development of an S-shaped heart loop in the sagittal section from the previously straight heart tube.
- Development steps
    - Different sections of the heart tube begin to grow at different speeds within the limited space of the pericardial cavity → Deformation of the previous tubular shape
    - Shift of the sections of the heart tube (from → to)
        - Cranial → Ventrocaudal and right
        - Caudal → Dorsocranial and left
    - Formation of the atrioventricular canal between the atrial and ventricular sections

### Septation Processes

- Timeframe: approx. 5th to 7th week of development
- Processes
    - Separation of the atria from the chambers
    - Septation of the atria
    - Septation of the ventricles
    - Separation of the outflow path

#### Separation of the Atria from the Chambers

- Starting point: Common and unseptated atrioventricular canal
- Development steps
    1. Four endocardial cushions develop on the left, right, dorsal, and ventral sides of the atrioventricular canal.
    2. Dorsal and ventral endocardial cushions merge in an H-shape to form the primary atrioventricular septum.
3. The atrioventricular canal is divided here into a right atrioventricular orifice (tricuspid orifice) and a left atrioventricular orifice (bicuspid orifice).
    4. From the endocardial cushions, the atrioventricular valves that separate the atria from the chambers (mitral and tricuspid valves) later develop in the area of the two openings.

#### Septation of the Atria

- Starting point
    - Atria and chambers already separated from each other (primary atrioventricular septum)
    - Atria not yet divided into left and right atrium
- Development
    1. Septum primum grows from the dorsal wall of the atrium towards the endocardial cushion of the atrioventricular canal.
    2. Septum primum and endocardial cushions merge, but not completely yet → Ostium primum forms above the atrioventricular canal.
    3. The ostium secundum forms through apoptosis in the upper part of the septum primum.
    4. The septum secundum grows from the right atrium to the right of the septum primum in front of the ostium secundum → The foramen ovale is formed.
    5. Further changes to the interatrial septum occur only after birth.
    6. Closure of the foramen ovale
    7. Fusion of the septum primum and secundum
8. Formation of the fossa ovalis as a remnant of the foramen ovale (the septum primum forms the floor of the fossa ovalis, the septum secundum forms its boundary with the limbus of the fossa ovalis)

> [!NOTE] Atrial septal defect
> During the development of the atrial septum, disturbances can occur that lead to the formation of various atrial septal defects (ASD). Because the pressure in the left atrium is (usually) higher than in the right, a left-to-right shunt occurs in the atria, resulting in subsequent volume overload of the right atrium and ventricle, which may cause right heart hypertrophy. Whether and to what extent symptoms such as exertional dyspnea arise and which therapy is appropriate for this (surgical, interventional, etc.) depends on the size of the defect.

> [!NOTE] Persistent foramen ovale
> About ¼ of the population has a foramen ovale that does not close or only closes incompletely. This so-called persistent foramen ovale (PFO) usually causes no symptoms; however, there is a risk that venous blood clots (e.g., in the case of deep vein thrombosis in the leg) can travel through the PFO from the right to the left heart and, for example, cause a stroke even in young individuals.

#### Septation of the Ventricles

- Starting point
    - Atria and chambers already separated from each other (atrioventricular septum primum)
    - Chamber not yet divided into left and right chamber
- Development
    1. The interventricular septum forms below the opening of the atrioventricular canal at the ventricular floor.
    2. The interventricular ridge grows towards the atrioventricular canal without closing it.
    3. The ventricles remain initially connected through the so-called interventricular foramen.
    4. The interventricular foramen is only closed by the fusion of the interventricular ridge and the conal septum (see below).

> [!NOTE] Ventricular septal defect
> If the process of ventricular septation is disturbed, this can lead to an incomplete separation of the ventricles; this is referred to as a ventricular septal defect. Most commonly, this occurs in the upper area (pars membranacea) of the septum. Since the left ventricle generates more pressure than the right ventricle, blood (shunt volume) flows from the left ventricle to the right ventricle; this is called a left-to-right shunt. As a result, there is an increased burden on the pulmonary circulation with blood. Smaller defects can close spontaneously, whereas very large ones can lead to dyspnea and growth disturbances and should be surgically closed.

> [!NOTE] Fallot's Tetralogy
> If disturbances occur during the septation processes of the ventricles and vessels, this can lead to a congenital heart defect. The tetralogy of Fallot describes a complex congenital malformation of the heart and consists of four components: 1) pulmonary stenosis, 2) ventricular septal defect, 3) "overriding" aorta, and 4) hypertrophy of the right ventricle. The aorta displaces over the ventricular septal defect and "rides" on it. This constricts the pulmonary artery along with its associated valve (pulmonary stenosis), which causes the right ventricle to build up more pressure and hypertrophy. Depending on the degree of obstruction of the outflow tract in the right ventricle, a left-to-right shunt or a right-to-left shunt results, following the pressure conditions.

#### Separation of the outflow tract (Conus arteriosus and Truncus arteriosus)

- Period: 5th to 7th week of development
- Starting point
    - Outflow tract (truncus arteriosus and conus arteriosus of the bulbous cordis) is still unseptated.
    - Ventricles not yet fully separated (communicating through the interventricular foramen)
- Goal: Separation of the later pulmonary trunk and the aortic root
- Development
    - Involved structures
        - Pairing trunk swellings (right-upper and left-lower in the area of the truncus arteriosus)
        - Pair of conical swellings (right-dorsal and left-ventral in the area of the conus arteriosus)
        - Membranous part of the interventricular septum
    - In the area of the trunk and conus arteriosus, a spiral septum (aorticopulmonary septum) forms, which separates the outflow path into the systemic and pulmonary circulation.
        - Both truncal swellings twist spirally, grow towards each other, and fuse to form the aorticopulmonary septum.
        - Right dorsal conus bulb transitions into the right upper trunk bulb, and left ventral conus bulb transitions into the left lower trunk bulb.
    - The fusion of the aorticopulmonary septum and the membranous part of the interventricular septum leads to the closure of the interventricular septum.

> [!NOTE]
> Through the spiral formation of the septum, the conus arteriosus becomes the later outflow tract of the two ventricles, while the truncus arteriosus forms the later aortic root and the truncus pulmonalis!

> [!NOTE] Transposition of the great arteries
> If the septum between the conus and the truncus arteriosus forms straight rather than spirally, the large vessel exits directly at the heart (aorta and pulmonary trunk) are swapped. The aorta originates from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle. As a result, the two circulatory systems are completely separated, which, if left untreated, would not be survivable, as no freshly oxygenated blood would enter the body. The child can only survive if the two circulatory systems are somehow connected (through another heart defect like a patent foramen ovale or a patent ductus arteriosus Botalli) or if they are artificially connected as soon as possible after birth (e.g., using the so-called Rashkind maneuver, which tears the atrial septum using a balloon catheter). This malformation should then be surgically corrected within the first two weeks of life.

### Reconstruction of the inflow track (sinus venosus)

- Period: 4th to 7th week of development
- Starting point
    - The sinus venosus, running horizontally, is located dorsal to the atrial section and expands to the right and left into the so-called sinus horns.
    - Both sinuses have three incoming veins each.
        - Stem of the cardinal vein (right common cardinal vein and left common cardinal vein)
        - Umbilical vein (right umbilical vein and left umbilical vein)
        - Dottervene (V. vitellina right and V. vitellina left)
- Goal: Inclusion of the sinus venosus into the right atrium
- Development
    - Left Sinus Horn
        - The left sinus horn and the left common cardinal vein develop into the coronary sinus and the oblique vein of the left atrium (Marshall vein)
        - The left umbilical vein drains into the liver plexus into the right vitelline vein and thus into the right sinus horn.
        - V. vitellina sinistra obliterated
    - Right Rhinoceros
        - Right atrium is involved in the right sinus horn.
        - The right common cardinal vein (Ductus Cuvieri) merges with the right anterior cardinal vein to form the superior vena cava.
        - V. right umbilical vein obliterated
        - The vena vitellina dextra develops into the inferior vena cava.

> [!NOTE]
> Essentially, there is a left-right shift of the venous blood flow. The left atrial horn primarily leads to the coronary sinus, whereas the right atrial horn mainly leads to both vena cavae and parts of the right atrium!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Structure of the Heart
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Name the two atrioventricular valves and describe their structure and location in the heart. What structures are they attached to in the heart wall?
- The tricuspid valve is located between the right atrium and right ventricle and consists of three fibrous leaflets. The bicuspid/mitral valve is located between the left atrium and left ventricle and consists of two leaflets. The leaflets are each connected by so-called chordae tendineae to papillary muscles of the heart wall.
What is the so-called heart skeleton and what is it made of?
- The heart skeleton is a connective tissue layer between the atria and ventricles, which surrounds the heart valves with so-called fiber rings (anuli fibrosi) and connects them through connective tissue triangles (trigonum fibrosum dextrum and sinistrum).
What are the fossa ovalis and limbus fossae ovalis, and from which prenatal structures do they originate?
- The fossa ovalis is a depression in the septum between right and left atrium and forms a remnant of the foramen ovale, the prenatal connection between the atria. The fossa ovalis is surrounded by the limbus fossae ovalis, a remnant of the septum secundum.
Describe the course of the so-called moderator band (Trabecula septomarginalis)!
- The moderator band is a bulge raised by the Tawara bundle and runs in the right ventricle from the septum to the anterior papillary muscle.
What is the cardiac plexus and where is it approximately located?
- The cardiac plexus is a network of autonomic nerve fibers at the heart base, whose branches approximately follow the coronary vessels.
In which heart valve defect is there an increase in both the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes of the left ventricle?
- In aortic valve insufficiency, due to inadequate closure of the aortic valve during diastole, there is a backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This imposes an additional blood volume load on the ventricle, which cannot be fully compensated by increasing stroke volume. Therefore, both end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes in the left ventricle increase.
In which phase of the cardiac cycle can a heart murmur be auscultated in the presence of aortic valve insufficiency, and where on the chest is it usually best heard?
- In aortic valve insufficiency, the insufficient closure of the aortic valve during diastole causes backflow of blood into the left ventricle. This leads to turbulence in the blood flow, which can be heard as a heart murmur at the auscultation point of the aortic valve (2nd intercostal space parasternal right) throughout the entire diastole.
Which heart valve defect leads to pressure overload of the left atrium and which leads to pressure overload of the left ventricle?
- Pressure overload occurs when the blood must be pumped against increased resistance. This happens when the heart valves are stenotic (narrowed). If the aortic valve is stenotic, the left ventricle must generate higher pressure to pump blood into the circulation – thus pressure overload of the left ventricle increases. If, however, the mitral valve is stenotic, the left atrium must generate higher pressure to ensure sufficient blood enters the left ventricle – thus pressure overload of the left atrium increases accordingly.

### Vascular Supply of the Heart

Through which vessel are the sinus and AV nodes supplied in most people, and what clinical relevance does a blockage of the vessel have?
- The important pacemaker centers of the heart (sinus and AV nodes) are supplied in most people by the right coronary artery, so blockage or narrowing of this vessel can lead to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.
Into which two main branches does the left coronary artery divide?
- The left coronary artery arises from the aorta and shortly thereafter divides into the anterior interventricular branch (ramus interventricularis anterior) and the circumflex branch (ramus circumflexus).
How is the chamber septum supplied with blood in the so-called normal supply type?
- In the normal supply type, the anterior two-thirds of the interventricular septum is supplied by the anterior interventricular branch of the left coronary artery, while the posterior one-third is supplied by the posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary artery.
What is the coronary sinus, how does it run, and where does it empty?
- The coronary sinus is the common end segment of the epicardial veins. It runs on the posterior surface of the heart in the coronary sulcus and empties into the right atrium.
Approximately ¾ of the venous blood from the heart returns to the heart via the coronary sinus system. How is the remaining quarter drained?
- A small portion of the venous blood of the heart drains directly into the chambers and atria. This happens via small trans- and endomural veins such as the Vv. cardiacae minimae (Thebesian veins).
In which phase of the heart does coronary circulation occur and why?
- Coronary perfusion occurs during diastole. Especially in the left ventricle, the pressure rise during systole compresses the coronary arteries such that perfusion is not possible. Only in diastole does the ventricular myocardium relax enough to allow coronary blood flow.
Which is the most important laboratory marker in suspected acute myocardial infarction?
- The most important laboratory marker to determine in suspected myocardial infarction is troponin I or T. Normally located inside heart muscle cells, it is released into the blood during cell death caused by infarction.

### Microscopic Structure

What is the innermost layer of the heart called and what does it cover?
- The innermost layer of the heart is the endocardium. It lines the inner surfaces of the heart and extends into the intima of the vessels near the heart. It also forms the four heart valves.
Describe the structure of the heart valves! How is their blood supply provided?
- The heart valves are formed by duplications of the endocardium and are so thin that they are largely avascular. Therefore, they are supplied directly from the blood flowing through the heart chambers.
How is the electrical excitation in the heart conducted from cell to cell?
- The heart valves are formed by duplications of the endocardium and are so thin that they are largely avascular. Therefore, they are supplied directly from the blood flowing through the heart chambers.
What are the so-called Purkinje fibers and how do they differ under the microscope from contractile cardiomyocytes?
- Purkinje fibers are specialized heart muscle cells that represent the final sections of the heart's excitation formation and conduction system and thus transmit electrical signals to the working myocardium. They are located between the endocardium and the actual myocardium in the tela subendocardialis and appear lighter compared to working muscle tissue due to their high glycogen content.

### Heart Sac (Pericardium)

What are the sinus transversus pericardii and obliquus pericardii, and how do they arise?
- The sinuses of the heart are blind-ending recesses of the pericardium that arise at the fold of the transition from the visceral to the parietal pericardial layer.
The pericardium extends beyond the heart. Which vessels are partially covered by it?
- The pericardium also covers parts of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk beyond the heart.

### Random-Forming Structures in X-ray Images

Which structures form the right heart border in a posterior-anterior (p.a.) X-ray?
- The right heart contour in a p.a. X-ray is formed (from cranial to caudal) by the superior vena cava and the right atrium.
Which structures form the left heart border in a plain X-ray?
- The left heart contour in a p.a. X-ray is formed (from cranial to caudal) by the aortic arch, pulmonary trunk, left atrial appendage, and left ventricle.

### Development

From which embryonic structure do the atrioventricular valves arise?
- In the fourth week of development, four endocardial cushions develop, beginning the separation of atria and ventricles. The ventral and dorsal endocardial cushions fuse with each other, forming a right and left ostium. Localized mesenchymal proliferation of the endocardial cushions in the regions of the ostia eventually leads to the development of the atrioventricular valves.
From which embryonic structures does the fossa ovalis originate?
- The fossa ovalis is a depression in the interatrial septum of the right atrium and represents the remnant of the foramen ovale. Its floor derives from the septum primum and its rim (limbus fossae ovalis) from the septum secundum.
What type of heart strain can an atrial septal defect lead to?
- From the truncus arteriosus arise the pulmonary trunk and the proximal segments of the aorta, thus parts of the systemic and pulmonary circulations. The separation of the outflow tract in the area of the truncus arteriosus occurs by formation of a spiral septum (aorticopulmonary septum).
What structures arise from the truncus arteriosus and how are these separated from each other during embryonic development?
- From the truncus arteriosus arise the pulmonary trunk and the proximal parts of the aorta, thus parts of the systemic and pulmonary circulations. The separation of the outflow tract in the region of the truncus arteriosus occurs through formation of a spiral septum (aorticopulmonary septum).
