# Salivary Glands
## Summary

The salivary glands (Glandulae salivariae) are exocrine glands that produce saliva and release it into the oral cavity through ducts. Secretion is regulated by the autonomic nervous system. There are three pairs of large salivary glands and numerous small salivary glands. Approximately 1–1.5 liters of saliva are produced each day. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the large salivary glands in the section of the same name in this chapter.

## Major Salivary Glands (Glandulae salivariae majores)

There are three major salivary glands, each arranged in pairs: the parotid gland (parotid salivary gland), the submandibular gland (submandibular salivary gland), and the sublingual gland (sublingual salivary gland). Each of these is an independent organ that lies outside the mucous membrane of the oral cavity and has a connective tissue capsule as its own boundary.

### Macroscopic Anatomy

The three major salivary glands each have their own connective tissue capsule and open with their ducts into different areas of the oral cavity.

#### Profile

- Function: Saliva production
- Location
    - Parotid gland: Retromandibular fossa
    - Submandibular gland: Submandibular triangle
    - Sublingual gland: Sublingual region
- Weight
    - Parotid gland: 20–30 g
    - Submandibular gland: 10–15 g
    - Sublingual gland: 5 g

#### Structure

All salivary glands have the same structure. There is a lobular system that is separated by connective tissue septa. In addition, the glands have secretory end pieces and a duct system with specialized sections that can further modify the secretion.

> [!NOTE] Mumps
> Mumps is a droplet infection caused by the highly contagious mumps virus, primarily affecting the parotid gland. It mainly affects children aged 2 to 15 years. A typical symptom is usually an initially unilateral and later bilateral inflammation of the parotid gland (parotitis), which is accompanied by swelling of the gland and mild fever. A protruding ear or chewing pain is also possible. There is no specific therapy available. The best protection is vaccination, which is recommended together with the measles and rubella vaccinations. After recovering from the illness, lifelong immunity exists. Pregnant women are considered a particularly vulnerable patient group, as a mumps infection in the first third of pregnancy can lead to the death of the embryo.

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Major Salivary Glands

The large salivary glands are divided into lobes and lobules by connective tissue septa. They are exocrine glands that possess so-called acini as secretory functional units. The primary secretion is directed from the acinus into the ducts, where it is further modified. A secondary secretion is formed, which is ultimately secreted. In the case of the large salivary glands, serous, mucous, and mixed glands are distinguished based on the nature of the secretion.

#### Joint Construction

- Connective tissue capsule: Connective tissue extends in the form of septa into the gland and divides it into lobes (lobus) and lobules (lobuli)
- End pieces
    - Secretory cells: Serous or mucous acinar cells
    - Myoepithelial cells: Contractile epithelial cells
- Execution path system
    - Intralobular ducts: Simple flat epithelium, myoepithelial cells
    - Intralobular strip pieces: Single-layered prismatic epithelium with basal eosinophilic striation
    - Interlobular duct: One to multiple layers of columnar epithelium
    - Main execution pathway: Two-layered prismatic epithelium

Striated ducts are only present in the three major salivary glands! This enables the histological distinction from other serous glands, such as the lacrimal gland or the exocrine portion of the pancreas!

### Function

Saliva consists of various components, all of which have different meanings and functions.

- Saliva production
    1. Formation of isotonic primary saliva in the terminal portions of the gland acini
        - With the help of the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase, Na+ is actively expelled from the gland cell, creating a gradient.
        - This enables the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransport from the blood into the gland cell; furthermore, Cl- is also taken up into the cell via a Cl-/HCO3- antiporter.
        - Cl- subsequently passesively enters the primary saliva from the cell through apical membrane channels.
        - Na+ and water follow paracellularly the Cl--ions
    2. Modification of the primary saliva to secondary saliva (hypotonic) during transport through the excretory ducts.
        - Resorption of Na+ and Cl- from the lumen into the duct cell and slight secretion of HCO3- and K+ from the duct cell into the lumen
            - The secretion of HCO3- and the resorption of Cl- occur through secondary active transport via an apically located Cl-/HCO3--antiporter.
            - Cl- subsequently passively enters the blood from the duct cell through basolateral membrane channels.
        - Since the epithelium is only slightly permeable to water and the NaCl reabsorption outweighs the ion secretion, the secondary saliva becomes increasingly hypotonic.
        - At a high saliva flow rate, the Na+ concentration of the saliva is higher, as there is less time for NaCl absorption.

|Saliva Component|Function|
|---|---|
|- Water|- Makes the saliva liquid|
|- Mucin|- Improves the glide ability of food|
|- α-Amylase|- Begins the digestion of carbohydrates|
|- Bicarbonate|- Ensures an alkaline environment so that the tooth enamel is not attacked and α-amylase is not inhibited|
|- Bactericides (e.g. lysozyme)|- Break down bacteria ingested through the mouth|

> [!NOTE]
> The submandibular gland produces the largest amount of saliva (about 70%) of the three major salivary glands!

> [!NOTE] Sjögren's Syndrome
> The Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the salivary and lacrimal glands are slowly destroyed. Those affected experience the primary symptoms of "dry mouth and dry eyes" (Sicca syndrome). The disease can only be treated symptomatically with eye drops, chewing gum, drinking plenty of fluids, etc. The disease primarily affects women.

### Development

The development of the salivary glands occurs from the ectodermal oral cavity through epithelial sprouts of the oral mucosa.

- Formation of the submandibular gland: 6th embryonic week
- Development of the parotid gland: 7th embryonic week
- Development of the sublingual gland: 9. embryonic week

## Additional Salivary Glands

### Minor salivary glands

The small salivary glands are embedded in the oral mucosa.

### Tubarial Glands [1]

- New description 2020: Discovery through PET-CT scans with marker F18-PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen) and salivary gland-like uptake
- Anatomical location: Paired salivary gland with the largest mass above the torus tubarius.
- Clinical relevance: In cases indicating radiation therapy, sparing these areas could reduce side effects such as dysphagia and xerostomia.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Salivary Glands
### Major Salivary Glands (Glandulae salivariae majores)

Where is the common opening of the submandibular duct and the major sublingual duct located?
- The ducts submandibularis and sublingualis major open bilaterally together under the tongue next to the frenulum linguae in the so-called caruncula sublingualis.

What is the course of the parotid gland duct and where does it open?
- The parotid gland (auricular salivary gland) lies in the retromandibular fossa. Its excretory duct runs over the masseter muscle, pierces the buccinator muscle, and finally opens at the level of the second upper molar in the oral vestibule.

What is the so-called primary saliva and how does it differ from secondary saliva? How are the two secretions formed?
- The so-called primary saliva is formed in the terminal portions of the glandular acini and is plasma isotonic. With the help of a basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase, Na+ is initially actively pumped out of the gland cell, creating a gradient that enables a Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransport from the plasma into the cell. Cl- is additionally taken up via a Cl-/HCO3- antiporter and subsequently passes passively through apical membrane channels from the cell into the primary saliva. Na+ and water follow paracellularly. The secondary saliva is hypotonic and arises by modifications of the primary saliva during its transport through the excretory ducts. Na+ and Cl- ions are reabsorbed by the epithelial cells, and K+ and bicarbonate are secreted into the saliva.

What effect do the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have on the salivary glands, and through which receptors do they mediate this?
- The salivary glands are autonomously controlled. When the parasympathetic nervous system is stimulated, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors of the glands are activated, increasing saliva production, mainly secreting watery saliva. When activation of the sympathetic nervous system stimulates the α1-adrenoceptors of the salivary glands, saliva production decreases, and a rather viscous saliva is secreted. For this reason, in exciting situations, e.g., during an exam, you quickly get a dry mouth.

From which cranial nerve nucleus do the fibers for the parasympathetic supply of the parotid gland originate?
- The parotid gland is the only one of the major salivary glands not innervated by the facial nerve (N. facialis). The parasympathetic fibers that supply it originate from the nucleus salivatorius inferior of the glossopharyngeal nerve (N. glossopharyngeus).

Describe the general structure of the excretory duct system of the major salivary glands. What characteristic allows them to be distinguished from other (serous) glands in a histological preparation?
- The excretory duct system of the major salivary glands is divided into several sections. The intralobular intercalated ducts attached to the acini consist of a single layer of flat epithelium and contain contractile epithelial cells (myoepithelial cells). Following them are the intralobular striated ducts, which consist of a single layer of columnar epithelium with a basal eosinophilic striation and are present only in the three major salivary glands. These striated ducts thus allow these glands to be distinguished histologically from other serous glands such as the exocrine pancreas. The interlobular excretory ducts are composed of one- to multi-row columnar epithelium, and the main excretory duct consists of two-layered columnar epithelium.

How can the three major salivary glands be histologically distinguished?
- The three major salivary glands can be distinguished histologically based on their respective special features. The parotid gland is a purely serous gland, whose acini are correspondingly acinar (spherical). Additionally, especially with age, fat cells are deposited in its connective tissue. The submandibular and sublingual glands both produce mixed secretions and therefore have tubuloacinar end pieces (tubular and spherical). Each has so-called von Ebner's crescent cells; these are serous cells that sit on the mucous cells in the form of a crescent. The two glands can be distinguished based on the ratio of their serous and mucous portions, since the serous (seromucous) portions predominate in the submandibular gland, while the mucous portions (mucoserous) predominate in the sublingual gland.
