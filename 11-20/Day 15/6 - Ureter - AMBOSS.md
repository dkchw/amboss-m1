# Ureter
## Summary

The paired ureters are the first part of the urinary tract. They have two important functions: on the one hand, they collect urine from the renal pelvis calyx system and transport it to the bladder; on the other hand, they have a closure mechanism that counteracts urine reflux and thus ascending infections.

The ureters are about 25–30 cm long and are divided into three sections (abdominal part, pelvic part, intramural part) depending on their position. They cross over and under various structures and have three constrictions, which are clinically particularly important because, for example, urinary stones can become lodged there.

The ureters develop from the ureteric buds that arise from the metanephric duct. By the way, you will also find a histo-trainer episode on the urinary tract in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the ureter.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile: Ureter

- Function: Urine transport
- Course: From the renal pelvis to the urinary bladder
- Length: 25–30 cm
- Diameter: Approx. 0.5 cm

### Structure of the Ureters

- Anatomical classification: Location-dependent in three sections
    - Abdominal part: Course from the renal pelvis in an arc downward to the linea terminalis of the pelvis
    - Pelvic floor: From the linea terminalis of the pelvis to the dorsal entrance into the wall of the bladder
    - Pars intramuralis: In the muscle layers of the bladder
- Clinical classification: Organ-dependent in three sections
    - Renal, lumbar, and vesical ureter segment

### Topography of the Ureters

- Course of the ureters (paired)
    - Starting from the renal hilum (level LWK I/II)
    - Exit dorsal of the renal artery and vein
    - Medio-caudal course in the retroperitoneal space on the fascia of the psoas major muscle
    - It runs diagonally through the muscle layers of the bladder.
    - Dorsal opening into the bladder as the ureteral orifice at the two upper points of the trigone of the bladder.
- Most important junctions of the ureters
    1. Cross the A. and V. testicularis (♂) or the A. and V. ovarica (♀) and cross over the N. genitofemoralis.
    2. Cross the common iliac artery and vein (or less commonly the external iliac artery and vein)
    3. Cross out the ductus deferens (♂) or the uterine artery (♀)
- Physiological constrictions of the ureters
    1. Departure of the ureter from the renal pelvis through a medio-caudal 90° exit (abdominal part)
    2. Crossing of the common iliac arteries A. and V. (Pelvic part)
    3. Intramural course in the bladder (intramural part)
    4. (Furthermore, the crossing of the testicular arteries and veins (♂) or the ovarian arteries and veins (♀) (abdominal part / pelvic part) is often referred to as the 4th constriction)

> [!NOTE]
> The ureters have a close retroperitoneal relationship to the genitofemoral nerve on the fascia of the psoas major muscle!

> [!NOTE]
> The ureters run beneath the A. testicularis (♂) or the A. ovarica (♀), over the iliac vessels and beneath the ductus deferens (♂) or the A. uterina (♀)!

> [!NOTE]
> The ureter is a "shy" structure, which is why it "hides" especially (or "crosses under") everything related to the genitals.

> [!NOTE] Ureteral colic
> The substances excreted through the kidney that are subject to urinary excretion often have a low solubility product. When this product is exceeded, the substances precipitate in the form of concretions (kidney stones). Calcium oxalate and phosphate stones are the most common. Typically, these kidney stones get stuck at the physiological constrictions of the ureter. The ureter attempts to transport the mechanical obstruction towards the bladder through increased peristaltic contractions. The increased contractions lead to a painful cramping of the muscle fibers, which is referred to as ureteral colic. Clinically, those affected often describe paroxysmal pain that radiates to the abdominal cavity, groin, or genital region. Therapeutically, an increased fluid intake and increased physical activity are aimed at promoting the spontaneous passage of the kidney stone.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation of the Ureters

- Vascular supply
    - Arterial
        - Abdominal part: A. renal
        - Pelvic part: A. testicularis (♂) or A. ovarica (♀)
        - Intramural part: A. superior/inferior vesical (♂) or A. uterine (♀)
    - Venous: The veins follow the arteries with the same designation.
- Lymph drainage
    - Abdominal part: Lumbar lymph nodes
        - Right: Nll. lateral cavaliers
        - Links: Lateral aortic ligaments
    - Pelvic region: External and internal iliac lymph nodes
    - Pars intramuralis: Drainage through the lymph nodes of the bladder
- Innervation
    - Efferents: Ureteric plexus
        - Sympathetic (Inhibition of ureter peristalsis)
            - Renal plexus (Aorticorenal ganglia)
            - Inferior hypogastric plexus (Th11–L1)
        - Parasympathetic (Increase in ureter peristalsis)
            - Pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2–S4)
            - Vagus nerve
    - Afferents: Fibers run with pelvic splanchnic nerves.
## Microscopic Anatomy

- Cross-section: Star-shaped lumen
- Wand construction
    - Mucous membrane
        - Transitional epithelium (= Urothelium)
        - Lamina propria
    - Tunica muscularis: Two to three layers of smooth muscle that run in a spiral fashion.
        - Stratum longitudinale internum: Inner, narrow longitudinal muscle
        - Stratum circulare: Strong circular muscle
        - In the pelvic region, additionally, external longitudinal layer: Outer, narrow longitudinal muscle
    - Tunica adventitia: Anchorage of the ureter in the surrounding area
## Function

- Harness transport
    - Directed towards the bubbles
    - In peristaltic waves
    - Speed of 2–3 cm/s
- Vesicoureteral reflux
    - Urinary conduits pull through the muscle of the bladder at an oblique angle (ostia ureteres)
        - Through continuous contraction of the bladder muscle layer, the opening is closed → protection against vesicoureteral reflux
        - Opening at a bladder-directed peristaltic wave

> [!NOTE] Vesicoureteral Reflux
> If the closure mechanism of a ureter is disturbed, there can be an increased retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters. Causes can include, for example, neurogenic factors and subvesical urinary flow obstructions. Patients typically complain of flank pain, and recurrent pyelonephritis (i.e., kidney pelvis inflammation) can also occur. Usually, conservative therapy with antibiotic treatment of infections is sufficient. In severe cases with massive kidney dilation or infections that cannot be controlled with medication, surgical measures are also employed.

## Development

The ureters develop from the ureteric buds, which arise from the mesonephric duct (= Wolff's duct). The development of the ureters is closely linked to the development of the kidneys from the metanephros (= metanephrogenic blastema) (see: "Development of the Kidney").
## Review Questions for the Chapter on Ureters
### Macroscopic Anatomy

What are the most important ureter crossings?
- The two ureters cross different structures on their course from the kidneys to the bladder. They each run under the testicular artery and vein (♂) or the ovarian artery and vein (♀), over the iliac vessels, and under the ductus deferens (♂) or the uterine artery (♀).

Where are the ureteral constrictions located?
- The ureters each have four narrowings: at their exit from the renal pelvis, at the crossing under the testicular artery and vein (♂) or the ovarian artery and vein (♀), at the crossing of the iliac vessels, as well as in their segment passing through the bladder wall.

How do kidney stones form and which substances are most commonly involved?
- Kidney stones can form when the solubility of a urinary substance in the urinary tract is exceeded. In such a case, more substance is present than can be dissolved in the urine, and it precipitates in the form of concretions (= kidney stones). The most common stones are calcium oxalate and phosphate stones.

### Microscopic Anatomy

Describe the histological structure of the ureter!
- The ureter shows a three-layered wall structure consisting of mucosa, muscularis, and adventitia. The mucosa consists of the transitional epithelium (= urothelium) typical for the urinary tract and the connective tissue lamina propria. The muscularis is composed of three layers of spiral smooth muscle, and the connective tissue adventitia anchors the ureter in the surrounding tissue.
