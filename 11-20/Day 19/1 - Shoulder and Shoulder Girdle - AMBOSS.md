# Shoulder and Shoulder Girdle
## Summary

The shoulder of the human body connects the upper limb to the trunk. It consists of several joints between the bony parts of the scapula, the humerus, and the clavicle. Its characteristic shape is primarily given to the shoulder by the muscular portions of the deltoid muscle.

The shoulder joint is one of the most mobile joints in the human body and is maintained and moved by a complex system of muscles (including the rotator cuff). Due to the large range of motion and the small bony joint surfaces, the shoulder joint is also very prone to injuries. Since all conduits to the upper extremity run through the shoulder area, shoulder injuries can also lead to pain and functional limitations of the upper extremity.

The anatomical and functional knowledge discussed here is an essential basis for the assessment and precise localization of pathologies that are, for example, identified during the orthopedic examination of the shoulder.
## Bones

### Clavicle

The clavicle is an S-shaped bone that connects the sternum to the scapula.

- Bone ends
    - Sternal extremity
    - Acromial extremity
- Corpus: Subclavian sulcus
- Inferior surface
    - Impression of the costoclavicular ligament (medial)
    - Tuberosity of the coracoclavicular ligament (lateral)
    - Conoid tubercle
    - Trapezoidal line

### Scapula

The scapula is a flat, triangular bone. Accordingly, three edges (margo medialis, superior, and lateralis) and three angles (angulus superior, inferior, and lateralis) are distinguished. The scapula also has an anterior (facies costalis or ventralis) and a posterior side (facies posterior).

- Edges
    - Medial border of the scapula
    - Margo superior scapulae
    - Lateral margin of the scapula
- Corners
    - Superior angle of the scapula
    - Inferior angle of the scapula
    - Lateral angle of the scapula
- Areas
    - Posterior surface
        - Spine of the scapula
        - Supraspinous fossa
        - Infraspinous fossa
        - Acromion
    - Costal surface (ventral)
        - Coracoid process
        - Scapular notch
    - Glenoid cavity: Small bony surface beneath the acromion, which serves as the glenoid fossa of the shoulder joint

> [!NOTE]
> At the lateral angle, the glenoid cavity can be found, which serves as the glenoid fossa of the shoulder joint!

> [!NOTE] Palpable bony landmarks of the scapula
> The palpable bony landmarks of the shoulder joint during the orthopedic examination include the spine of the scapula, medial border of the scapula, inferior angle of the scapula, lateral border of the scapula (examination from dorsal), as well as the acromion and coracoid process (examination from ventral).

> [!NOTE] Incisura-Scapulae-Syndrome
> In the incisura scapulae, the N. suprascapularis runs, supplying the M. infraspinatus and the M. supraspinatus and is crossed by the Lig. transversum scapulae superius. In the case of ossification of this ligament, it closes off the incisura scapulae from above, thus forming a bony canal, the foramen scapulae. In this canal, compression of the N. suprascapularis can occur, which initially manifests as movement-dependent pain in the shoulder and later can lead to atrophies and paresis of the M. infraspinatus and the M. supraspinatus.

## Joints

The region colloquially referred to as the shoulder consists of four individual joints: Acromioclavicular joint, Sternoclavicular joint, Glenohumeral joint, and the scapulothoracic joint-thorax-joint which is not covered here. The interaction of all four joints is responsible for the large mobility of the arm (e.g., lifting/lowering, rotating).

### Acromioclavicular Joint

- Synonyms: Acromioclavicular joint, lateral clavicle joint, “AC joint”
- Functions
    - Elevation / Depression (Movement)
    - Protraction/Retraction
    - Circumduction
    - Rotation
- Joint type: Functional Ball joint
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Scapula: Acromion
        - Clavicula: Lateral End
    - Soft tissue
        - Coracoclavicular ligament: It stretches between the coracoid process of the scapula and the lateral end of the clavicle
            - Division into
                - Lig. conoideum (medial part)
                - Trapezoid ligament (lateral part)
        - Acromioclavicular ligament: Reinforcement of the upper side of the joint capsule

> [!NOTE] Acromioclavicular Joint Injury
> In the event of a fall on the shoulder with the arm adducted, damage and dislocation of various structures of the acromioclavicular joint can occur. The severity of injuries to the AC joint is classified according to Tossy and Rockwood. If both the acromioclavicular ligament and the coracoclavicular ligament are torn, the clavicle loses its caudal attachment. Due to the continued pull of the trapezius muscle at the lateral end of the clavicle, it dislocates cranially, resulting in a visible step in the AC joint. In this case, the lateral end of the clavicle can be pushed down like a piano key against spring resistance, which is referred to as the piano key phenomenon.

### Sternoclavicular joint (= Articulatio sternoclavicularis, medial clavicle joint)

- Definition: The sternoclavicular joint is formed by the medial end of the clavicle and the sternum.
- Functions
    - Elevation / Depression (Movement)
    - Protraction/Retraction
    - Circumduction
- Joint type: Restricted ball-and-socket joint
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Sternum: Manubrium sterni
        - Clavicle: Medial End
    - Soft tissue
        - Anterior sternoclavicular ligament and posterior sternoclavicular ligament
        - Interclavicular ligament
        - Costoclavicular ligament
        - Muscular stabilization: M. subclavius

> [!NOTE]
> The sternoclavicular joint is the only true joint connection of the shoulder girdle to the trunk!

### Glenohumeral joint (= Art. glenohumeralis, Art. humeri, shoulder joint)

- Definitions
    - In the glenohumeral joint, the humeral head articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula (glenoid cavity).
    - The glenohumeral joint is stabilized not only by bony and ligamentous structures but also by the musculature of the rotator cuff and the long head of the biceps brachii.
- Functions
    - Anteversion/Retroversion
    - Internal/External rotation
    - Ab-/Adduction
    - Elevation (Abduction >90°)
        - Problem: At about 90°, the greater tubercle of the humeral head becomes trapped under the acromion and hinders further movement.
        - Solutions
            1. Rotation of the glenoid cavity of the scapula cranially
            2. Rotation of the Greater tubercle posteriorly (so that the smaller Lesser tubercle lies beneath the Shoulder roof)
- Joint type: Ball joint
- Involved Structures
    - Bone
        - Scapula: Glenoid cavity
        - Humerus: Head of the humerus
    - Soft tissue
        - Coracoacromial ligament ("AC-Band")
        - Coracohumeral ligament
        - Lig. glenohumeral
        - Lig. transversum humeri: It stretches between the greater tubercle and lesser tubercle of the humerus and over the intertubercular groove, in which it secures the biceps tendon.
    - Bursa
        - Subacromial bursa
        - Subdeltoid bursa
        - Subscapularis muscle bursa.
            - Generally communicates openly with the joint capsule
    - Axillary recess: Reserve fold when the arm is hanging down, which ensures greater mobility in the joint.
    - Support: Shoulder roof

> [!NOTE]
> The bony structures of the glenohumeral joint are of different sizes - the humeral head is about four times larger than the glenoid cavity of the scapula. This results in a great range of motion, but also in instability of the joint!

> [!NOTE]
> The bursa (subacromial bursa and subdeltoid) are often related to each other and are referred to as the "subacromial accessory joint"!

> [!NOTE] Shoulder Joint Dislocation
> Due to the great range of motion of the shoulder joint, it is the most commonly dislocated joint. In most cases, the humeral head dislocates ventrally/caudally under the coracoid process (subcoracoid dislocation). After an initial dislocation, recurrent dislocations can occur with damage to stabilizing structures without significant triggering trauma. The humeral head can be repositioned through a variety of different maneuvers, with gentle procedures such as the Milch maneuver, Stimson, or Kocher being primarily used in clinical practice.

## Muscles

The shoulder area is an anatomically complex region primarily consisting of three important joints, several muscle groups, and conduits (see below). The contour of the shoulder is formed by a few muscles, essentially by the deltoid muscle. Another muscle group, referred to as the so-called rotator cuff, is primarily responsible for the stability and movement of the glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). The scapula (scapula) is mainly moved by several muscle loops made up of antagonistic muscles. Furthermore, movements of the scapula and the shoulder joint are also supported by muscles of the upper arm, such as the Mm. triceps and biceps brachii.

### Rotator Cuff

The tendons of the muscles of the rotator cuff surround the humeral head from all sides and pull it towards the joint surface of the scapula. They thus stabilize the glenohumeral joint and also project into its joint capsule (especially the infraspinatus muscle), thereby strengthening it. The deltoid muscle sits on the rotator cuff like a protective cap but is not counted among it.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function in Shoulder Joint|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. supraspinatus|- Supraspinous fossa|- Greater tubercle of humerus|- Abduction in shoulder joint|- Via the suprascapular nerve|
|M. infraspinatus|- Infraspinous fossa|- External rotation in the shoulder joint|
|M. teres minor|- Lateral margin of the scapula|- External rotation at the shoulder joint, adduction|- Axillary nerve|
|M. subscapularis|- Subscapular fossa (Costal surface of the scapula)|- Lesser tubercle of the humerus|- Internal rotation in the shoulder joint|- Subscapular nerves|

> [!NOTE] Impingement syndrome
> If the subacromial or subcoracoid space is narrowed by degenerative changes, edema or bleeding, it can lead to the impingement of tendon material (especially the tendon of the M. supraspinatus) and other soft tissue in this area. This is referred to as the so-called impingement syndrome and classically leads to a painful restriction of shoulder movement in those affected. Pain often occurs specifically during abduction or elevation between 60° and 120°, which is referred to as the so-called painful arc.

### Muscle Sling of the Shoulder Girdle

Muscle slings consist of several functionally antagonistic muscles. In the shoulder region, four muscle slings are distinguished that can move the scapula in specific directions (oblique sling, horizontal sling, vertical anterior sling, and vertical posterior sling). An important role is played by the trapezius muscle, which fulfills different functions with its three parts, which is why they are listed separately in this chapter (→ Transverse part of the trapezius muscle, Descending part of the trapezius muscle, Ascending part of the trapezius muscle).

#### Slanted Sling

- Components: Mm. rhomboidei and M. serratus anterior
- Function: Movement of the scapula on a dorsal/cranial-ventral/caudal track

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Mm. rhomboidei|- M. rhomboideus minor: Procc. spinosi HWK 6-7|- Medial border of the scapula|- Scapula: Pulling medially/cranially<br>- Lateral angle of the scapula: Rotation caudally|- N. dorsalis scapulae|- In conjunction with the Mm. rhomboidei, the M. levator scapulae rotates the lower part of the scapula medially and allows for the return of the elevated arm to a neutral position|
|- M. rhomboideus major: Spinous processes T1-4|
|M. serratus anterior|- Rib cage 1-9|- Superior angle of the scapula (Superior part)<br>- Medial border of the scapula (Intermediate and inferior parts)<br>- Inferior angle of the scapula (Inferior part)|- Scapula: Movement laterally/ventrally and return after arm elevation<br>- Inferior angle of the scapula: Cranial rotation|- Long thoracic nerve|- Accessory respiratory muscle|

> [!NOTE] Scapula alata
> If, for example, the long thoracic nerve is injured by carrying a heavy backpack, it leads to a functional impairment of the serratus anterior muscle. This muscle normally covers the medial side of the scapula from the ventral side and "pulls" it toward the thorax. In the event of this muscle's failure, the medial side of the scapula protrudes wing-like from the thorax. This symptom is referred to as "scapula alata" (from Latin ala = "wing").

> [!NOTE]
> Between M. subscapularis and M. serratus anterior lies a connective tissue layer that allows the movement of the scapula on the thorax. This false joint is referred to as the scapula-thorax-joint!

#### Horizontal Sling

- Components: M. serratus anterior and transverse part of the M. trapezius
- Function: Moving and rotating the scapula along a medial-lateral line

#### Vertical Rear Sling

- Components: M. levator scapulae and ascending part of the M. trapezius
- Function: Moving and rotating the scapula and its glenoid cavity on a cranio-caudal rail

### Muscles of the shoulder with attachment on the upper arm

In addition to the antagonistically acting muscle loops, the shoulder is moved by other muscles that attach to the humerus. The contour of the shoulder is primarily shaped by the deltoid muscle.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function in Shoulder Joint|Innervation|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Ventral Shoulder Musculature|   |   |   |   |   |
|M. pectoralis major|- Clavicular part: Medial Clavicle|- Crest of the greater tubercle humerus|- Adduction, Internal rotation, Anteversion|- Medial and lateral pectoral nerves|- Forms the anterior axillary fold<br>- Caudal segments are part of the accessory respiratory muscles|

|- Scapular part: Inferior angle of the scapula|
|M. teres major|- Inferior angle of the scapula<br>- Lateral border of the scapula|- Thoracodorsal nerve and/or subscapular nerve|- None|

> [!NOTE]
> The deltoid muscle is the most important abductor in the shoulder joint!

### Additional muscles for shoulder movement

In addition to those already mentioned, there are other muscles that are involved in movements in the shoulder area. Some of these belong to the upper arm musculature. The relevant muscle components are only listed here as a supplement, but are discussed in detail in Upper Arm and Elbow.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|Special Features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. subclavius|- Medial 1. Rib and costal cartilage|- Sulcus of the subclavius muscle of the clavicle|- Lateral clavicle is pulled caudally|- N. subclavius|- A part of the muscle fibers helps to keep the subclavian vein open|

## Vessels and Innervation

The area of the shoulder and the upper extremity is supplied by the branches of the A. subclavia and its continuation after the clavicle, the A. axillaris. There are several important anastomoses in the shoulder area between the vascular territories of the A. subclavia and the A. axillaris, which are referred to as shoulder blade anastomoses. The entire upper extremity, from the shoulder girdle to the fingers, is innervated by the various nerves of the plexus brachialis. This, in turn, is formed from branches of the spinal cord segments C5–Th1.

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. subclavia from Aorta (left) and Truncus brachiocephalicus (right)<br>    - A. vertebralis<br>    - A. thoracica interna<br>    - Truncus thyrocervicalis<br>        - A. thyroidea inferior<br>        - A. cervicalis ascendens<br>        - A. transversa colli<br>            - R. superficialis<br>            - R. profundus (= A. dorsalis scapulae)<br>        - A. suprascapularis<br>    - Truncus costocervicalis<br>        - A. intercostalis suprema<br>        - A. cervicalis profunda<br>- A. axillaris as continuation of the A. subclavia<br>    - A. thoracica superior<br>    - A. thoracoacromialis<br>        - Rr. pectorales<br>        - R. acromialis<br>        - R. clavicularis<br>        - R. deltoideus<br>    - A. thoracica lateralis<br>    - A. subscapularis<br>        - A. thoracodorsalis<br>        - A. circumflexa scapulae<br>    - A. circumflexa humeri anterior<br>    - A. circumflexa humeri posterior|
|Venous|- Dorsal: Vv. suprascapularis et dorsalis scapulae drain into V. subclavia<br>- Ventral: Vv. pectorales drain into V. subclavia<br>- Medial: V. axillaris drains into V. subclavia<br>- Lateral: V. thoracoepigastrica drains into V. axillaris|
|Innervation|   |
|Motor/Sensory|- Brachial plexus|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph Nodes|- The medial shoulder drains primarily into the subclavian trunk, from<br>    - Deltopectoral lymph nodes<br>    - Supraclavicular lymph nodes<br>    - Lateral cervical lymph nodes<br>    - Deep inferior lymph nodes<br>- The remaining shoulder drains primarily into the subclavian trunk, from<br>    - Lateral axillary lymph nodes and Subscapular lymph nodes|

> [!NOTE]
> The A. subclavia becomes the A. axillaris in the area between the first rib and the clavicle. Along its course, numerous anastomoses are formed between the two arteries. A well-known anastomosis is, for example, the so-called scapular anastomosis between the A. circumflexa scapulae, the A. dorsalis scapulae, and the A. suprascapularis!

## Topography

Topographically interesting in this region are primarily the axillary cavity (Fossa axillaris) and the so-called axillary gaps.

### Regions

- Suprascapular and lateral cervical region
- Deltoid region
- Scapular region
- Axillary region
- Pectoral region
- Infraclavicular region

### Boundaries of the Axillary Fossa

The axillary fossa is a pyramidal space through which important vessels and nerves pass from the trunk to the arm. At the apex of the axilla, they penetrate the axillary fascia, which is formed as a sieve plate (lamina cribrosa) at this point. Other conduits exit the axillary fossa through the axillary openings towards the dorsal side (see below).

- Limitations
    - Medial: M. serratus anterior
    - Lateral: Humerus, M. coracobrachialis
    - Ventral: Mm. pectoralis major and minor
    - Dorsal: M. latissimus dorsi, M. teres major, M. subscapularis

> [!NOTE]
> The anterior axillary fold (Plica axillaris anterior) is formed by the M. pectoralis major, and the posterior axillary fold (Plica axillaris posterior) is formed by the M. latissimus dorsi!

### Sales Gaps

Between the M. teres minor (cranial) and the M. teres major (caudal) is a horizontal slit, which is divided into a medial (triangular) and a lateral (quadrangular) axillary space by the long head of the M. triceps brachii. Caudal to the M. teres major is the triceps slit.

#### Medial Axillary Gap

The medial axillary space is shaped like an acute triangle, with its tip pointing medially. Therefore, the medial axillary space has a cranial, caudal, and lateral boundary, but no medial boundary.

- Limitations
    - Cranial: M. teres minor
    - Caudal: M. teres major
    - Lateral: M. triceps brachii (Long head)
- Contained structures: A. and Vv. circumflexae scapulae

#### Lateral Axillary Gap

The shape of the lateral axillary space roughly corresponds to a rectangle, so it is framed by four limiting structures.

- Limitations
    - Cranial: M. teres minor
    - Caudal: M. teres major
    - Medial: M. triceps brachii (Long head)
    - Lateral: Humerus
- Included Structures
    - A. and Vv. circumflexae humeri posterior
    - N. axillaris

#### Triceps Slot

The triceps groove has the shape of an acute-angled triangle, with its tip pointing caudally. Therefore, the triceps groove has a cranial, lateral, and medial boundary, but no caudal boundary.

- Limitations
    - Cranial: M. teres major
    - Lateral: Humerus
    - Medial: M. triceps brachii (Long head)
- Included Structures
    - A. profunda brachii
    - N. radialis

> [!NOTE]
> A simple trick to recall the limiting structures of the axillary spaces is to replicate them with the middle and index fingers of both hands. With both hands, a "Victory sign" is formed, which is positioned at an angle of about 90° on top of each other to create three gaps that imitate the axillary spaces!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Shoulder and Shoulder Girdle
### Joints

What movements does the shoulder joint (= articulatio glenohumeralis, glenohumeral joint) allow?  
- The glenohumeral joint allows ante-/retroversion, internal/external rotation, ab-/adduction as well as elevation.  
How is the elevation of the arm (= abduction >90°) enabled?  
- The elevation of the arm (abduction >90°) is enabled by a combined movement of the scapula and humerus (so-called humeroscapular rhythm). In this process, the glenoid cavity of the scapula rotates cranially; at the same time, the greater tubercle of the humerus rotates dorsally (otherwise the greater tubercle would collide with the acromion and inhibit further movement beyond 90°).  
### Muscles

Which muscles belong to the so-called rotator cuff?  
- The rotator cuff includes M. supraspinatus, M. infraspinatus, M. teres minor and M. subscapularis.  
Name the function and innervation of the subscapularis muscle!  
- The M. subscapularis is responsible for internal rotation in the shoulder joint. It is innervated by the subscapular nerves (Nn. subscapulares).  
Name the function and innervation of the M. supraspinatus!  
- The M. supraspinatus is responsible for abduction in the shoulder joint. It is innervated by the suprascapular nerves (Nn. suprascapulares).  
What is an impingement syndrome and how does it manifest?  
- Impingement syndrome describes the impingement of tendon material (primarily the tendon of the M. supraspinatus) in the pathologically narrowed subacromial space and typically causes pain during abduction or elevation of the arm between 60° and 120°.  
What movements do the rhomboid muscles allow in the shoulder joint?  
- The rhomboid muscles (Mm. rhomboidei) move the scapula medially/cranially.  
Name the origin, approach, innervation, and function of the M. levator scapulae!  
- The M. levator scapulae belongs to the vertical posterior muscle sling of the shoulder girdle. It originates from the transverse processes (Procc. transversi) of the 1st and 2nd cervical vertebrae and the posterior tubercles of the 3rd–4th cervical vertebrae and inserts at the superior angle (Angulus superior) of the scapula. It is innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve (N. dorsalis scapulae). Its contraction pulls the scapula cranially.  
Which muscles attach to the crista tuberculi minoris of the humerus?  
- The M. latissimus dorsi, M. teres major, as well as M. coracobrachialis attach to the crista tuberculi minoris of the humerus.  
Name the function and parts of the latissimus dorsi muscle!  
- The large M. latissimus dorsi consists of the pars vertebralis, pars iliaca, pars costalis, and pars scapularis. It causes adduction, internal rotation, and retroversion in the shoulder joint.  
Which muscles are innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve?  
- The thoracodorsal nerve (N. thoracodorsalis) innervates the M. teres major and M. latissimus dorsi.  
Which muscle originates with its spinal part at the spine of the scapula?  
- The spinal part (pars spinalis) of the M. deltoideus originates at the spine of the scapula (Spina scapulae).  
Which muscle is considered the most important abductor of the shoulder joint? For which spinal cord segment is it regarded as a key muscle?  
- The M. deltoideus is the most important abductor in the shoulder joint. It is innervated by the axillary nerve (N. axillaris) (C5–C6) and is regarded as a key muscle for the C5 segment.  
Which movements in the shoulder joint allow for the various functions of the M. deltoideus?  
- Contraction of the clavicular part (pars clavicularis) of the M. deltoideus leads to anteversion, internal rotation, and adduction of the arm. The acromial part (pars acromialis) causes abduction of the arm. The spinal part (pars spinalis) allows retroversion, external rotation, and adduction in the shoulder joint.  
### Vessels and Innervation

Which vessel supplies the shoulder and the upper extremity with its branches?  
- The shoulder and upper extremity are supplied on the left by the subclavian artery (A. subclavia) and its branches, on the right by the brachiocephalic trunk (Truncus brachiocephalicus) and its branches.  
Name the four branches of the A. subclavia!  
- The branches of the subclavian artery (A. subclavia) are the vertebral artery (A. vertebralis), internal thoracic artery (A. thoracica interna), the thyrocervical trunk (Truncus thyrocervicalis), and the costocervical trunk (Truncus costocervicalis). It continues as the axillary artery (A. axillaris).  
### Topography

What are the boundaries of the axillary fossa?  
- The axillary fossa (Fossa axillaris) is bordered medially by the M. serratus anterior, laterally by the humerus and M. coracobrachialis, ventrally by the Mm. pectoralis major and minor, and dorsally by the M. latissimus dorsi, M. teres major and M. subscapularis.  
Which structures pass through the medial and which through the lateral axillary space?  
- The medial axillary space (mediale Achsellücke) contains the circumflex scapular artery and veins (A. und Vv. circumflexae scapulae); the lateral axillary space (laterale Achsellücke) contains the posterior circumflex humeral artery and veins (A. und Vv. circumflexae humeri posteriores) as well as the axillary nerve (N. axillaris).  
What is the triceps hiatus and which structures pass through it?  
- The triceps hiatus (Trizepsschlitz) has the shape of an acute-angled triangle with its tip pointing caudally. It is bounded cranially by the M. teres major, laterally by the humerus, and medially by the M. triceps brachii. The deep brachial artery (A. profunda brachii) and the radial nerve (N. radialis) pass through it.
