# Thoracic cavity
## Summary

The thorax consists of the chest wall, the thoracic cavity, and the contained thoracic organs. Cranially, the thoracic cavity is bounded by the superior thoracic aperture and caudally by the inferior thoracic aperture with the diaphragm. Ventrally and dorsally, the ribs and the sternum, respectively, and the ribs and the thoracic spine form the boundaries. The thoracic cavity is divided into a mediastinum and two pleural cavities. The pleural cavities only house the lungs; all other organs (thymus, caudal trachea, esophagus, and heart) as well as major vessels of the thorax pass through the mediastinum.
## Mediastinum

The mediastinum is the central space of the thoracic cavity through which all the conduits as well as organs (except for the lungs) of the thoracic cavity pass. Ventrally, it is bordered by the sternum, dorsally by the spine, and laterally by the two pleural cavities. Anatomically, an upper and a lower mediastinum are distinguished, with the lower mediastinum further divided into three additional sections.

> [!NOTE] Mediastinitis
> An inflammation of the mediastinal space (=mediastinitis) is most commonly caused by bacteria. The most frequent cause of bacterial colonization is a defect in the esophagus (esophageal perforation), for example, during a gastroscopy or due to a tumor condition. Bacteria can also enter the mediastinum through descending infections from the throat or nasal cavity or through thoracic trauma. Symptoms may include fever, pain behind the sternum or in the back, possibly also a subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and face, up to shock symptoms. Acute mediastinitis can be life-threatening and must be treated – in addition to therapy for the underlying condition – with drainage of the inflamed tissue and with antibiotics.

## Pleural Cavity

There are two pleural cavities (= Cavitas pleuralis): one right (= Cavitas pleuralis dexter) and one left (= Cavitas pleuralis sinister). The cavities serve as a shifting and reserve space for the lungs during their breathing movements. The pleural cavities are lined by a mesothelial layer called the pleura. Two layers of the pleura are distinguished: the visceral pleura, which covers the lung, and the parietal pleura, which lines the inner side of the chest cavity. Between the two pleural layers is the so-called pleural fluid.

### Pleura Leaves

The pleurae are serous membranes made of mesothelium (a thin, single-layered epithelium with flattened cells and microvilli).

- Visceral pleura: Covers the surface of the lungs
- Parietal pleura: Lines the thoracic cavity and is divided into four sections.
    - Costal pars: Lines the inner side of the chest wall.
    - Parietal portion: Covers the diaphragm
    - Mediastinal part: Covers the wall lateral to the mediastinum
    - Cervical part with the pleural dome (= Cupula pleurae): Covers the wall above the upper thoracic aperture.

The parietal pleura with the pleural dome exceeds the upper thoracic aperture by about 3 cm!

At the lung hilum, the parietal pleura and the visceral pleura merge and form the pulmonary ligament, which extends towards the diaphragm!

The visceral pleura is not innervated and therefore (in contrast to the parietal pleura) not sensitive to pain!

#### Pleural recesses

At the point where the various portions of the parietal pleura merge into one another, the parietal pleura forms recesses (= pleural recesses), which serve as reserve spaces for the lung during deep inspiration.

- Pleural recesses: Outpouchings of the pleural cavity at the transition points of the various parts of the parietal pleura.
    - Function: Reserve spaces that the lung can take in during deep inspiration
    - Shape and position: According to the shape and position, three recesses are distinguished.
        1. Costodiaphragmatic recess
            - Arises at the transition between the costal part and the diaphragmatic part
            - Largest reserve space of the pleura
2. Costomediastinal recess: It arises at the junction between the costal part and the mediastinal part.
        3. Phrenic-mediastinal recess: It arises at the junction between the diaphragmatic part and the mediastinal part.

#### Pleurafree Triangles

Between the 2nd and 4th ribs behind the sternum, the margins of the parietal pleura on the right and left sides come into contact. Above and below this contact point, the edges of the parietal pleura on both sides diverge, creating two pleura-free triangles.

- Thymus triangle (= Thymic trigone): Located behind the manubrium sterni
- Cardiac triangle (= Trigonum cardiacum): It is located in front of the pericardium and is bordered by the costomediastinal recess.

### Pleural fluid

The pleural fluid is a serous fluid that is located between the two pleural layers.

- Place of education: Mesothelium of the visceral pleura and parietal pleura
- Resorption type: Lymphatic vessels
- Functions
    - Facilitates the mobility of the two pleural sheets.
    - Ensures that the lung remains attached to the thorax.
- Amount: In healthy adults, about 5 mL – 15 mL

Pleural effusion

- Definition: Fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity between the parietal pleura and the visceral pleura.
- Causes (Selection):
    - Fluid leakage from the capillaries due to downstream congestion
    - Fluid leakage from the capillaries due to a changed blood composition and a decreased colloid osmotic pressure
    - Tumor or inflammation-related blood barrier disturbance with leakage of cells and fluid from the bloodstream
- Clinic: Dyspnea
- Findings of the physical examination
    - Auscultation: Diminished or absent breath sounds on the affected side
    - Percussion: Damped percussion sound ascending laterally
- Diagnostics
    - The effusion collects in the upright upper body due to gravity, particularly in the costodiaphragmatic recess.
    - Sonography: Echogenic-free (“black”) fluid between the pleural layers
    - X-ray of the Thorax: Sickle-shaped, laterally ascending shadowing ("bright area") of the lateral angle
- Therapy
    - Puncture
    - Treatment of the underlying condition
## Arterial Vessels

The largest and most important artery that runs through the thoracic cavity is the aorta. The section of it that passes through the thorax is divided into three parts. Additionally, the pulmonary arteries (= Arteriae pulmonales) are located in the mediastinum, arising from the pulmonary trunk beneath the aortic arch.

### Aorta in the Mediastinum

The aorta emerges from the aortic valve of the heart in the chest cavity and is divided according to its course into three sections: ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta.

#### Ascending aorta

The ascending aorta arises directly from the aortic valve as an ascending section of the aorta and runs mostly within the pericardial sac. Immediately after its origin from the heart, the coronary arteries branch off from it.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Aortic valve of the heart|
|Course|- Ascending course<br>- Mostly runs within the pericardial sac|
|Departures|- Right coronary artery<br>- Left coronary artery|
|Service Area|- Heart Wall|

Directly at the origin of the ascending aorta, the vessel wall at the level of the three cusps of the aortic valve is expanded to the so-called sinuses of the aorta; this is where the coronary arteries arise. Together, the sinuses are referred to as the aortic bulb!

#### Aortic Arch

The aortic arch (= Arcus aortae) refers to the part of the aorta from which the brachiocephalic trunk leaves the aorta.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Arises from the ascending aorta|
|Course|- Curves to the left and dorsally<br>- Extends at the level of the 4th thoracic vertebra to the left side of the spine|
|Spatial relationship|- Curves around the left lung root<br>- Leaves an imprint on the left lung surface<br>- Close topographical relationship with the esophagus and trachea|
|Departures|- Brachiocephalic trunk<br>- Left common carotid artery<br>- Left subclavian artery|
|Service Area|- Head<br>- Arms|

> [!NOTE]
> Just before the transition into the descending aorta, the aortic arch is often slightly constricted; this area is called the aortic isthmus!

> [!NOTE] Aortic coarctation
> An aortic coarctation refers to a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the area of the aortic isthmus. To compensate for the narrowing, a bypass circulation develops through the internal thoracic arteries and the intercostal arteries. Their increased blood flow leads to pressure overload and pressure atrophy of the adjacent ribs, which can be evidenced as notches along the lower edge of the ribs (= rib notches) in X-ray images. Since such a picture only arises after a long illness, rib notches usually appear only after the age of 5.

#### Descending Aorta (Thoracic Part)

The descending aorta is referred to in the thoracic cavity as the thoracic aorta and in the abdominal cavity as the abdominal aorta.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Arises from the aortic arch|
|Course|- Runs downward into the abdominal cavity<br>- Runs to the left of the spine|
|Lagebeziehung|- Located to the left of the spine and behind the esophagus<br>- Passes through the diaphragm|
|Departures|- Bronchial branches<br>- Esophageal branches<br>- Mediastinal branches<br>- Pericardial branches<br>- Superior phrenic arteries<br>- Posterior intercostal arteries|
|Service Area|- Lung<br>- Esophagus<br>- Mediastinum<br>- Pericardium<br>- Diaphragm<br>- Chest Wall|

### Branches of the Thoracic Aorta

In the following table, the branches of all sections of the thoracic aorta are presented along with their main branches and areas of supply listed.

|Departures|   |Branches|Service Area|
|---|---|---|---|
|Ascending aorta|Right coronary artery|- See also: Structure of the heart|   |
|Left coronary artery|
|Aortic arch|Brachiocephalic trunk|- Right subclavian artery<br>    - Internal thoracic artery<br>- Right common carotid artery<br>    - Internal carotid artery<br>    - External carotid artery|- Head and arms|
|Left common carotid artery|- Internal carotid artery<br>- External carotid artery|
|Left subclavian artery|- Internal thoracic artery<br>- Vertebral artery<br>- Thyrocervical trunk<br>- Costocervical trunk|
|Descending Aorta|Paired Branches|   |   |
|Posterior intercostal arteries|–|- Thoracic wall|
|Aa. subcostales|–|
|Aa. phrenicae superiores|–|- Diaphragm|
|Unpaired Departures|   |   |
|Rr. oesophageales|–|- Esophagus|
|Bronchial tubes|–|- Lungs|
|Rr. mediastinales|–|- Mediastinum|
|Rr. pericardiaci|–|- Pericardium|
### Pulmonary trunk

The pulmonary trunk arises from the pulmonary valve of the right heart. Below the aortic arch, it divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries, which lead to and supply the right and left lungs, respectively.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Source|- Pulmonary valve of the heart|
|Course|- Runs approximately from the 3rd rib up to the 2nd rib and splits there<br>- Since the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk into the left pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery lies just below the aortic arch, the right pulmonary artery then runs dorsal to the ascending aorta and ventral to the descending aorta|
|Spatial relationship|- Encircles the ascending aorta and splits directly under the aortic arch|
|Bifurcation|- Right pulmonary artery<br>- Left pulmonary artery|
|Service Area|- Lung|

> [!NOTE]
> The aorta and the pulmonary trunk are connective tissue linked by the ligamentum arteriosum (obliterated ductus arteriosus Botalli)!

### Venous Vessels

The influx of venous blood from the organs to the heart occurs almost exclusively via the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava. They have a close connection to the azygos system of the body wall and run approximately perpendicular to the pulmonary veins.

### Superior vena cava

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Source|- Arises from the convergence of the left and right brachiocephalic veins|
|Course|- Runs behind the sternum, next to the ascending aorta<br>- Runs ventral to the right pulmonary artery<br>- Drains into the right atrium at approximately the level of the 3rd rib|
|Tributaries|- V. azygos – Confluence just above the right main bronchus|
|Power Area|- Head<br>- Neck<br>- Arm<br>- Chest Wall|

> [!NOTE]
> The superior vena cava, like the inferior vena cava, has no venous valves. The reason for this is the large diameter and the strong suction effect of the heart!

### Brachiocephalic veins

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Formed by the confluence of the subclavian vein and the internal jugular vein|
|Course|- The right brachiocephalic vein is shorter than the left and runs almost vertically downward<br>- The left brachiocephalic vein is about twice as long as the right and runs almost horizontally<br>- They course the furthest ventrally of all vessels in the upper mediastinum<br>- The brachiocephalic veins on both sides merge to form the superior vena cava|
|Inflow|- Inf. inferior thyroid veins<br>- Internal thoracic veins<br>- Thymic veins<br>- Mediastinal veins<br>- Tracheal veins<br>- Pericardial veins<br>- Esophageal veins<br>- Bronchial veins<br>- Accessory hemiazygos vein<br>- Vertebral veins<br>- Superior intercostal vein<br>- Left superior intercostal vein|
|Power Area|- Chest wall<br>- Neck<br>- Esophagus<br>- Lung<br>- Pericardium|

### Inferior vena cava

The inferior vena cava collects the venous blood from the lower extremities, the pelvis, and the abdominal cavity. It passes through the foramen venae cavae of the diaphragm into the thoracic cavity and drains directly above the diaphragm into the right atrium. For a more detailed overview, see LK conduction pathways of the abdominal cavity.

### Azygossystem

The azygos system consists of the azygos vein, the hemiazygos vein, and the accessory hemiazygos vein.

#### Azygos vein

The azygos vein is an unpaired vein that only occurs on the right side of the body. It is the continuation of the right ascending lumbar vein of the abdominal cavity.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Continuation of the right ascending lumbar vein|
|Course|- Runs along the right paravertebral posterior thoracic wall|
|Tributaries|- Posterior intercostal veins<br>- Bronchial veins<br>- Superior phrenic veins<br>- Esophageal veins<br>- Hemiazygos vein<br>- Possibly accessory hemiazygos vein|
|Power Area|- Chest Wall|

> [!NOTE]
> The azygos vein exists only on the right side of the body!

#### Hemiazygos vein

The hemiazygos vein is an unpaired vein that occurs only on the left side of the body. It forms the continuation of the left ascending lumbar vein of the abdominal cavity.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Continuation of the left ascending lumbar vein|
|Course|- Runs along the left paravertebral area of the posterior thoracic wall<br>- Typically crosses to the right side at the level of thoracic vertebra 8 and empties into the azygos vein|
|Tributaries|- Postintercostal veins<br>- Superior phrenic veins<br>- Possibly accessory hemiazygos vein|
|Power Area|- Chest Wall|

> [!NOTE]
> The hemiazygos vein exists only on the left side of the body!

#### Accessory hemiazygos vein

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Origin|- Arises from the confluence of the 4th to 8th posterior intercostal veins|
|Course|- Extends cranially as a continuation of the hemiazygos vein<br>- Anteriorly anastomoses with the hemiazygos vein or independently drains into the azygos vein<br>- Often, there is also a connection between the accessory hemiazygos vein and the left brachiocephalic vein|
|Inflow|- Superior left intercostal vein|
|Power Area|- Chest Wall|

### Pulmonary veins

The pulmonary veins carry oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the left atrium. For a more detailed representation, see LK trachea and lung.
## Nervous System

In the thoracic cavity, there are primarily fibers of the autonomic nervous system for the innervation of the organs. As an important somatic nerve, the phrenic nerve also extends with its branches to the pericardium and diaphragm.

### Sympathetic Nervous System in the Thoracic Cavity

The sympathetic nerve fibers in the thoracic cavity originate from the so-called sympathetic trunk (= Truncus sympathicus).

- Course of the sympathetic nervous system in the thoracic cavity
    - Pulls vertically downwards on both sides of the spine.
    - Form a boundary string ganglion in each segment.
        - Connected with each other through R. interganglionares
        - Connected to the intercostal nerves by Rr. communicantes, Rr. communicantes albus, and R. communicans griseus
- Branches of the sympathetic nervous system in the thoracic cavity
    - 2.–5. Border strand ganglia
        - Cardiac thoracic nerves to the cardiac plexus
        - Fibers to the plexus of the large vessels
        - Pulmonary thoracic veins to the pulmonary plexus
    - 5.–9. Border chain ganglia: Greater splanchnic nerve to the celiac plexus
    - 10.–11. Border chain ganglia: Lesser splanchnic nerve to the celiac plexus

### Parasympathetic Nervous System in the Thoracic Cavity

The parasympathetic nerve fibers in the thoracic cavity originate from the vagus nerve.

- Course of the parasympathetic nervous system in the thoracic cavity
    - Enter the thoracic cavity through the upper thoracic aperture.
        - Right between the V. brachiocephalica and the truncus brachiocephalicus
        - Links between the left brachiocephalic vein and the left subclavian artery
    - Moves behind the lung root into the posterior mediastinum
    - Passes through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm
- Branches of the parasympathetic nervous system in the thoracic cavity
    - Recurrent laryngeal nerve
        - The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is given off in the upper thoracic aperture and loops around the right subclavian artery.
        - The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is first given off in the upper mediastinum and wraps around the aortic arch.
    - Fibers to the pharyngeal plexus
    - Fibers of the esophageal plexus
    - Fibers to the pulmonary plexus
    - Fibers to the cardiac plexus
        - Superior cervical cardiac nerves
        - Inferior cervical cardiac nerves
        - Thoracic cardiac nerves

### Somatic Nervous System in the Thoracic Cavity - Phrenic Nerve

The main nerve that runs through the thoracic cavity from the somatic nervous system is the phrenic nerve (N. phrenicus). It is a mixed nerve and gives off both sensory and motor branches.

- Function
    - Motor innervation: diaphragm
    - Sensible Innervation: Pericardium, parietal pleura (mediastinal and diaphragmatic parts), parts of the parietal peritoneum and visceral peritoneum
- Course
    - Enters through the M. scalenus anterior into the upper thoracic aperture.
    - It extends ventrally from the lung root and the vagus nerve further caudally.
    - Runs together with the vasa pericardiacophrenica in a connective tissue layer (= pleuropericardial septum) between the pericardium and the parietal pleura
- Branches
    - Rr. pericardiaci to the pericardium
    - Small branches to the parietal pleura
    - Phrenicoabdominal branches to the peritoneum
    - Motor endings to the diaphragm

> [!NOTE]
> The phrenic nerve is historically a cervical nerve and receives its fibers from the segments C3–C5!

## Lymph Vessels

There are some important lymphatic vessels in the thoracic cavity. These include the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct.

### Thoracic duct

The thoracic duct is the largest lymphatic vessel in the body. It collects lymphatic fluid from the lower half of the body, the left thoracic organs, the left arm, and the left side of the head, and directs it into the left venous angle. Due to the milky consistency of the lymph after food intake, it is often referred to as the "chyle duct."

- Function: Collects lymph fluid from the lower half of the body, the left thoracic organs, the left arm, and the left side of the head.
- Location: In the superior mediastinum as well as the posterior mediastinum in front of the spine
- Course
    - Begins at the cisterna chyli
    - Passes between the descending aorta and the spine through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm
    - Initially runs to the right of the aorta directly in front of the spine
    - Moves to the left at the level of Th5
    - Now runs behind the esophagus between the aorta and the spine.
- Confluence: Left venous angle – this is formed by the union of the left internal jugular vein and subclavian vein.
- Inflows
    - Right and left lumbar trunk
    - Intestinal trunk
    - Left jugular trunk
    - Left subclavian trunk
    - Left bronchomediastinal trunk

> [!NOTE] Palpable Virchow's lymph node
> The so-called Virchow lymph node is located just before the point where the thoracic duct drains into the left venous angle. In very advanced tumor diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (especially in gastric carcinoma), the lymph node may be palpable or even visible in the supraclavicular region. This is a sign that the tumor cells have already metastasized significantly through the lymphatic system.

### Right lymphatic duct

The right lymphatic duct collects the lymph fluid from the right upper quadrant of the body and drains into the right venous angle.

- Function: Collects the lymph fluid from the "right upper quadrant" of the body
- Location: Superior mediastinum
- History:
    - Begins ventrally of the M. scalenus anterior
    - Arches over the pleural dome
    - Reaches the right venous angle after about 1–2 cm
- Confluence: Right venous angle
- Inflows
    - Right jugular trunk
    - Right subclavian trunk
    - Right bronchomediastinal trunk
## Diaphragm

The diaphragm is a muscle plate that separates the pleural cavity (thorax) from the peritoneal cavity (abdomen). It is the most important respiratory muscle.

### Macroscopic Anatomy

#### Profile

- Function: Enlarges the space in the thorax and thus drives inspiration.
- Location: Lies horizontally in the thorax
    - At inspiration at the level of the 7th rib
    - During expiration at the level of the 4th rib
- Form: Dome-shaped

#### Structure

The diaphragm consists of a connective tissue center that is connected to the ribs and the spine by various muscle strands.

- Central tendon: Connective tissue plate with an opening for the inferior vena cava (Foramen venae cavae)
    - Serve all muscle strands as an attachment
- Sternal part: Muscle strands originating from the posterior surface of the xiphoid process (sternum)
- Costal part: Muscle strands originating from the inner surfaces of the 7th to 12th ribs.
- Lumbar psoas: Muscle strands originating from the 1st to 3rd lumbar vertebrae, the muscle fascia of the quadratus lumborum, and the psoas major.
    - Contains openings for the esophagus (esophageal hiatus) and the aorta (aortic hiatus)

#### Vascular Supply and Innervation

> C 3, 4, 5 keep the diaphragm alive!

#### Topography of the Diaphragm

Since the diaphragm separates the chest and abdominal cavity, many important structures must pass through openings in the diaphragm.

|Pass-through holes in the diaphragm|Penetrating structures|
|---|---|
|Foramen of the venae cavae|- Inferior vena cava<br>- Phrenicoabdominal branch (Branch of the right phrenic nerve)|
|Hiatus esophageus|- Esophagus<br>- Vagus nerve (as anterior and posterior vagal trunk)|
|Hiatus aorticus|- Aorta<br>- Thoracic duct|
|Sternocostal triangle (left Larrey space, right Morgagni space)|- A./V. internal thoracic|
|Lumbocostal triangle (Bochdalek gap)|- None<br>    - Most common site of congenital diaphragmatic hernias (so-called Bochdalek hernias)|
|Columns in the muscle tracts of the LWK|- V. (hemi‑)azygos<br>- Splanchnic nerves|
|Spaces between muscle bundles to the lumbar vertebrae and to the psoas|- Sympathetic trunk|

### Microscopic Anatomy of the Diaphragm

The microscopic structure of the diaphragm corresponds to that of a normal striated muscle. See Chapter: Skeletal Muscle for more information.

### Function of the Diaphragm

The diaphragm is the most important muscle of respiration. During inspiration, it contracts and lowers from the level of the 4th to that of the 7th rib. This increases the intrathoracic volume, and the lung follows due to the negative intrapleural pressure. (See also LK Lung: Process of respiration).

### Development of the Diaphragm

The diaphragm develops from three components: the septum transversum, the paired pleuroperitoneal folds, and the musculature from the body wall.

- 3. Developmental week: The transverse septum forms from a mesenchymal thickening caudal to the heart and grows from ventral towards the esophagus. The transverse septum and the dorsal mesentery of the esophagus unite.
- 6.–7. Development week: The pleuroperitoneal folds grow from dorsal towards the transverse septum and dorsal mesentery of the esophagus and merge with it.
- 4th month of development: The muscle cells of the body wall migrate from the periphery into the fetal diaphragm.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Chest Cavity
### Mediastinum

What areas are distinguished in the mediastinum and where are their boundaries located?
- The mediastinum is divided into an upper part (mediastinum superius) and a lower part (mediastinum inferius). The mediastinum inferius is further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior portions. The mediastinum anterius extends from the back of the sternum to the anterior surface of the heart. The mediastinum medium refers to the area occupied by the heart and pericardium. The mediastinum posterius is located behind the heart.

What structures are located in the anterior mediastinum?
- In the narrow mediastinum anterius are only vessels (vasa thoracica interna) and lymph nodes (Nll. parasternales).

Which nerves are located in both the superior mediastinum and the middle mediastinum?
- The phrenic nerves (Nn. phrenici) pass through the mediastinum superius and medium to the diaphragm.

### Pleural Cavity

What are the pleural layers made of and at what point do the visceral and parietal pleura merge?
- The pleural layers are serous membranes made of mesothelium. At the lung hilum, the parietal pleura and the visceral pleura merge and form the ligamentum pulmonale, which extends towards the diaphragm.

How is the parietal pleura supplied with blood?
- The parietal pleura is arterially supplied by the intercostal arteries (Aa. intercostales) and the pericardiacophrenic artery (A. pericardiacophrenica).

What are the so-called pleural recesses and where are they located?
- The pleural recesses (recessus pleurales) are outpouchings at sites where different parts of the parietal pleura merge into each other. During deep inspiration, they serve as reserve spaces for the lung. Based on their location, three recesses are distinguished: the costodiaphragmatic recess (recessus costodiaphragmaticus), costomediastinal recess (recessus costomediastinalis), and phrenicomediastinal recess (recessus phrenicomediastinalis).

What is the purpose of pleural fluid and how much mL does a healthy adult typically have?
- Pleural fluid is a serous fluid located between the two pleural layers that minimizes friction between them. Additionally, it ensures that the lung adheres to the thorax. In a healthy adult, its volume is about 5 mL.

Where are the two pleural-free triangles located?
- Approximately in the middle of the sternum, the reflection lines of the left and right parietal pleura contact each other. Above this, behind the manubrium sterni, is the so-called thymus triangle. Below the contact point lies the other pleura-free triangle in front of the pericardium: the cardiac triangle (Herzdreieck). It is bounded by the costomediastinal recess.

### Arterial and Venous Vessels

Describe the course of the superior vena cava!
- The superior vena cava (V. cava superior) is formed by the junction of the left and right brachiocephalic veins (V. brachiocephalica). It runs behind the sternum on the right side of the ascending aorta (Aorta ascendens). Then it passes ventral to the right pulmonary artery (A. pulmonalis dextra) caudally and drains into the right atrium roughly at the level of the third rib.

Which venous vessels are located the farthest ventrally in the upper mediastinum?
- The brachiocephalic veins (Vv. brachiocephalicae) run most ventrally among all vessels in the upper mediastinum.

Describe the course of the azygos vein!
- The azygos vein was not described in the given text. (Note: The input text mistakenly repeats the branches of the descending aorta here instead.)

Name the paired branches of the descending aorta!
- The descending aorta (Aorta descendens) gives off the following paired branches: the posterior intercostal arteries (Aa. intercostales posteriores) and subcostal arteries (Aa. subcostales) for the supply of the thoracic wall, as well as the superior phrenic arteries (Aa. phrenicase superiores) to supply the diaphragm.

How is the esophagus supplied with blood?
- The esophagus (Ösophagus) is arterially supplied by the esophageal branches (Rr. oesophageales) from the thoracic descending aorta.

Which arterial vessel is located exactly between the ascending aorta and the descending aorta?
- Since the pulmonary trunk (Truncus pulmonalis) bifurcates directly below the aortic arch, the right pulmonary artery (A. pulmonalis dextra) runs dorsal to the ascending aorta and ventral to the descending aorta.

### Nervous System and Lymph Vessels

What function do the cisterna chyli and the thoracic duct have?
- The cisterna chyli is the central collecting vessel for lymph from the abdominal cavity and lower extremities. It continues as the thoracic duct (Ductus thoracicus), which, as the largest lymphatic vessel of the body, collects lymph from the left thoracic organs, left arm, and left side of the head during its course.

In which part of the mediastinum is the thoracic duct located, through which diaphragm opening does it pass, and where does it drain?
- The thoracic duct runs in the superior or posterior mediastinum in front of the vertebral column, passes together with the aorta through the aortic hiatus (Hiatus aorticus) in the diaphragm, and drains into the left venous angle.

Which nerve wraps around the right subclavian artery?
- The right recurrent laryngeal nerve (N. laryngeus recurrens) branches off already in the upper thoracic aperture and loops around the right subclavian artery (A. subclavia dextra).

### Diaphragm

Which openings are located in the lumbar part of the diaphragm and which structures pass through them?
- The lumbar part (Pars lumbalis) of the diaphragm contains the esophageal hiatus (Hiatus oesophageus), the passage for the esophagus accompanied by the vagus nerve (N. vagus), as well as the aortic hiatus (Hiatus aorticus), through which the aorta and the thoracic duct pass.

Which vessels supply the diaphragm venously and arterially?
- The diaphragm is supplied arterially by the superior and inferior phrenic arteries (A. phrenica) and by the internal thoracic artery (A. thoracica interna). Venous drainage occurs via the superior phrenic veins (Vv. phrenicae superiores) into the azygos/hemiazygos veins (V. azygos/V. hemiazygos) and via the inferior phrenic veins (Vv. phrenicae inferiores) into the inferior vena cava (V. cava inferior).

How do the splanchnic nerves and the sympathetic trunk enter the thoracic cavity?
- The splanchnic nerves (Nn. splanchnici) and the sympathetic trunk (Truncus sympathicus) enter the thoracic cavity through unnamed gaps in the muscular fibers of the diaphragm.
