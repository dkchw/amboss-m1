# Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation
## Summary

The cessation of bleeding (hemostasis) is a vital multi-step process that ends a bleed with the help of a clot (thrombus) made from a special plasma protein (fibrin). The entirety of the steps leading to thrombus formation is summarized under the term "hemostasis," distinguishing between two phases: primary and secondary hemostasis.

Initially, a three-dimensional network of platelets is formed during primary hemostasis, covering the area of the endothelial defect (the so-called white thrombus). Primary hemostasis consists of three steps that the platelets undergo: attachment to the endothelial defect with the help of a protein called von Willebrand factor (adhesion), release of coagulation-promoting substances into the blood (activation), and finally, interlinking with each other through fibrinogen molecules (aggregation).

During secondary hemostasis, certain plasma proteins (so-called coagulation factors), most of which are serine proteases, are activated through proteolytic cleavage. A coagulation factor that has been activated in this way then specifically activates another factor, leading to a stepwise, self-amplifying process (so-called coagulation cascade). This cascade can be initiated through two different pathways: the intrinsic and the extrinsic system. Throughout hemostasis, both pathways run in parallel and culminate in the activation of the serine protease thrombin. Thrombin ultimately forms the stable thrombus (so-called red thrombus) by converting fibrinogen into fibrin.

To prevent unwanted or excessive coagulation, the body also has mechanisms to inhibit hemostasis: Several protease inhibitors (including antithrombin, protein C) circulate in the blood, which can inhibit thrombin and other coagulation factors. After the completion of wound healing, the fibrin thrombus is broken down by the serine protease plasmin (known as fibrinolysis).

The correct process and the required duration until fibrin formation can be measured in the laboratory using various tests. They provide insights into the causes of different disorders within hemostasis.

By the way, you can also find some Auditor episodes on the topic of blood coagulation (Primary Hemostasis Part 1 and 2, Secondary Hemostasis Part 1–3).

## Platelets (Thrombocytes)

Platelets, along with the coagulation factors in plasma, are responsible for blood clotting.

### Profile: The Platelet

- Synonym: Platelets, short: Platelets (engl. platelet)
- Platelet count: 150,000–400,000/μl (reference range)
- Diameter: Approx. 3 μm
- Form
    - In a resting state, it has a biconvex shape, which is stabilized by microtubules.
    - After activation, the formation of pseudopodia occurs.
- Important cell components
    - Granules: α-granules, electron-dense granules (δ-granules), lysosomes (λ-granules)
    - Mitochondria with enzymes of the respiratory chain (high ATP consumption upon activation)
    - Filaments: Actin, Filamin → Ensure the formation of pseudopodia and the retraction of the clot
    - Kernel-free: Protein biosynthesis limited possible
- Education: Budding from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (see: thrombopoiesis), stimulated by thrombopoietin (TPO) and interleukin-11
- Lifespan: 5–12 days, breakdown in the spleen
- Storage: About ⅓ of all platelets are stored in the spleen.
- Functions: Primary hemostasis and secondary hemostasis

|Designation|Platelet count in the blood|
|---|---|
|Thrombocytopenia|<150,000/μL|
|temporary, reactive thrombocytosis|usually 450,000 to <1 million/μL|
|long-lasting thrombocytosis|usually >1 million/μL|

> [!NOTE]
> Platelets do not have a cell nucleus, as they are formed by the budding of extensions from the megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.

### Ingredients of the Platelet Granules

In the cytoplasm of platelets, there are three different forms of granules: α-, δ-, and λ-granules. α- and δ-granules store coagulation-promoting mediator molecules, while λ-granules are lysosomes.

|Granule|Active Ingredient|Function|
|---|---|---|
|α-Granules|Von Willebrand factor (vWF)|- Primary hemostasis: Connects platelets to exposed collagen via the GPIb receptor (Adhesion)<br>- Secondary hemostasis: Binds to factor VIII in plasma (Transport and stabilization)|
|Fibrinogen (Factor I)|- Primary Hemostasis: Connects the platelets to each other via the GPIIb / IIIa receptor (Aggregation)<br>- Secondary Hemostasis: Forms the fibrin clot|
|Factor V|- Is the cofactor of factor X (in the phase of secondary hemostasis)|
|Factor VIII|- Is the cofactor of factor IX (in the phase of secondary hemostasis)|
|Fibronectin|- Primary hemostasis: Supports platelet adhesion and aggregation<br>- Secondary hemostasis: Binds covalently to fibrin → Fibrin network becomes denser|
|Growth factors: PDGF, VEGF, FGF, TGF-β|- Wound healing and angiogenesis|
|α2-Antiplasmin|- Inhibits clot breakdown (fibrinolysis): As a serine protease inhibitor, it selectively inhibits plasmin|
|δ-Granules|ADP|- Activates platelets → Platelet aggregation|
|Ca2+|- Important cofactor in coagulation (for platelet aggregation and for the serine proteases of secondary hemostasis)|
|Serotonin|- Activates platelets<br>- Promotes vasoconstriction|
|λ-Granules (Lysosomes)|Acid hydrolases|- Likely serve to destroy pathogens|

> [!NOTE]
> While α-granules mainly contain large proteins for platelet adhesion, δ-granules only contain relatively small molecules for platelet activation!

> [!NOTE]
> Endothelial defects and exposed tissue collagen trigger the emptying of platelet granules (degranulation). The substances released firstly promote the degranulation of additional platelets (positive feedback) and secondly initiate the plasmatic blood coagulation (secondary hemostasis)!

> [!NOTE] Petechien
> Petechiae are pinhead-sized (<3 mm) hemorrhages into the tissue that can theoretically occur in any organ. However, they are particularly significant in the skin, as they are immediately visible to those affected or the treating physician. They are an initial indication of a coagulation disorder and thus diagnostically significant. In the majority of cases, the cause lies with the platelets: either there is a thrombocytopenia (quantitative disorder) or a thrombocytopathy (qualitative disorder) at play. Thrombocytopenia can arise, for example, from decreased blood production or increased consumption, such as in uncontrolled coagulation during sepsis. In thrombocytopathy, the platelet count in the blood is usually normal, but their disturbed function leads to decreased blood coagulation, so that in these cases, petechiae can also occur. As an alternative cause, inflammation of small blood vessels (vasculitis) must always be considered, where damage to the endothelium leads to pinpoint blood extravasation into the tissue. In cases of petechiae, a complete blood count should always be requested, and further coagulation parameters determined.

> [!NOTE] Thrombocytopathies and thrombastenia
> Thrombocytopathies are disorders based on a dysfunction of the platelets and result in an increased tendency to bleed. A distinction is made between acquired (e.g., medication-induced) and hereditary forms. An example of a hereditary thrombocytopathy is the so-called thrombasthenia (syn. Glanzmann-Naegeli syndrome), which means weak (asthenic) platelets. Characteristic of this disease is that, despite a normal platelet count in the blood, there can still be spontaneous nosebleeds or large bruises (even after minor injuries). The cause lies in a mutation in the GPIIb or GPIIIa gene, which leads to a defective GPIIb/IIIa receptor. As a result, the receptor cannot bind its ligand fibrinogen, and the networking of the platelets among themselves, i.e., platelet aggregation, does not occur.

## Primary Hemostasis (= Cellular Hemostasis)

In primary hemostasis, several phases are distinguished, which are collectively referred to as platelet hemostasis: adhesion, activation, and aggregation.

1. Vascular Hemostasis
2. Platelet adhesion to damaged endothelium via GPIb receptor and von Willebrand factor
3. Platelet activation: Formation of pseudopodia, phospholipid expression on the cell surface, and release of ADP, thromboxane A2, and platelet-activating factor (PAF)
4. Platelet aggregation via GPIIb/IIIa receptor and fibrinogen → formation of a deposition thrombus from platelets (white thrombus)

### Vascular Hemostasis

Some authors divide primary hemostasis into two separate phases: on one hand, the previously mentioned platelet hemostasis, and on the other hand, a vascular hemostasis phase that occurs beforehand. Vascular hemostasis takes place within the first minute immediately after a blood vessel injury. It reduces blood flow in the affected vessel on one hand and promotes the adhesion of platelets to the endothelial defect on the other hand.

- Definition: Constriction (vasoconstriction) of the injured blood vessel, which is triggered by endothelial and smooth muscle cells during primary hemostasis.
- Involved cells: Endothelium (Intima), smooth muscle (Media)
- Procedure: Not yet definitively clarified
- Effect: The vascular constriction (vasoconstriction) induced by the endothelium itself promotes hemostasis through two effects.
    1. Blood circulation ↓
    2. Shear forces in the blood ↑
        - Definition gravitational force: Force that results from friction between opposing movements
        - Significance for coagulation: Platelet adhesion to the endothelium is promoted.

### Adhesion of Platelets

- Procedure: Injury with endothelial damage → Exposure of subendothelial connective tissue proteins, especially collagen → Binding of von Willebrand factor from the blood to collagen as well as to the von Willebrand receptor on the platelet membrane
    - Von Willebrand factor (vWF): Glycoprotein that connects collagen and platelets.
        - Synthesis sites: Megakaryocytes, Endothelium
        - Storage locations: Platelets, subendothelial matrix, blood
        - Von Willebrand factor receptor (vWR = GPIb-IX-V receptor complex): Glycoprotein tetramer on platelet membranes
- Result: Platelets cover the endothelial damage

### Activation of Platelets

- Process: Wall-adherent platelets secrete ADP from δ-granules → ADP binds to ADP (P2Y12) receptors on other platelets → Formation of pseudopodia and stimulation of cyclooxygenase (COX) → Thromboxane A2 synthesis↑ → Secretion of additional granule contents (degranulation)
    - Thromboxane A2: Arachidonic acid derivative that leads to platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.
        - Synthesis: COX-dependent
        - Storage location: No storage
        - Thromboxane receptor: Located on the membrane of platelets and smooth muscle cells, Gq protein-coupled receptor
- Result: The activated platelets release their granules and cause the activation of additional platelets through the released mediators (positive feedback or chain reaction).

### Aggregation of Platelets

- Procedure: Platelet activation induces a conformational change of the fibrinogen receptor on the platelet membrane → Fibrinogen receptor binds fibrinogen from blood plasma → Formation of a network in which platelets are interconnected by fibrinogen bridges.
    - Fibrinogen (Factor I): Glycoprotein and precursor of fibrin, connects platelets with each other.
        - Synthesis site: Hepatocytes
        - Storage location: Circulates in plasma
        - Fibrinogen receptor (GPIIb/IIIa): Complex of the glycoproteins GPIIb and GPIIIa on the platelet membrane, capable of binding fibrinogen and vWF.
- Result: The extensions of several platelets connect through fibrinogen molecules to form a dense cellular network, known as the "platelet plug" or "white thrombus."

> [!NOTE]
> The platelet membrane protein GPIb binds to von Willebrand factor, while the GPIIb/IIIa receptor binds fibrinogen!

> [!NOTE]
> Thromboxane A2 from the platelets has a vasoconstrictor effect and promotes platelet aggregation! Prostacyclin from the endothelium, on the other hand, has a vasodilatory effect and inhibits platelet aggregation!

> [!NOTE] Platelet aggregation inhibition
> Some medications influence primary hemostasis. The most well-known representative of this group is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA); it has pain-relieving (analgesic), fever-reducing (antipyretic), anti-inflammatory (antiphlogistic), and anticoagulant (anticoagulatory) effects. These effects arise from the inhibition of the two cyclooxygenases (COX1 and 2), which are responsible for the increased synthesis of fever- and pain-inducing prostaglandins during inflammation. In platelets, however, COX1 also synthesizes the mediator substance thromboxane A2, which causes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Therefore, the intake of ASA, whether intentional or as a side effect, always leads to a restriction of primary hemostasis. This effect is utilized (prophylactically) in patients who have an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.

> [!NOTE] Von Willebrand syndrome
> The Von Willebrand syndrome is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The cause is usually an autosomal dominant inherited deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Three types are distinguished, depending on whether the factor is produced in only reduced amounts (types I and II) or not at all (type III). The vWF deficiency leads to fewer platelets being able to adhere to exposed connective tissue collagen after a vascular injury. Therefore, the phase of platelet adhesion, an important component of primary hemostasis, occurs more slowly and to a lesser extent. Most affected individuals are asymptomatic, but an increased tendency to bleed may manifest through frequent nosebleeds or post-operative bleeding during medical procedures (e.g., tooth extractions, surgeries). Affected individuals should avoid taking acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), as it further inhibits platelet aggregation. Therapeutically, vWF preparations can be substituted via infusion in cases of life-threatening bleeding or prior to surgical procedures.

## Secondary Hemostasis (= Plasma Hemostasis)

The secondary hemostasis causes the coagulation or "precipitation" of fibrin in plasma. It is triggered by a sequence of activation steps involving certain plasma proteins (the so-called coagulation factors) and is referred to as the "coagulation cascade" due to its stepwise progression.

### Coagulation Factors

- Definition: Plasma proteins that circulate in the blood as inactive precursors and are converted into an active (coagulation-promoting) form through limited proteolytic cleavage.
- Nomenclature: Designation with Roman numerals I–XIII (1–13)
    - A Roman numeral without letters represents the inactive form (precursor protein), while the numeral with an attached "a" represents the active form (active enzyme)
    - Example: Factor II = Prothrombin (inactive), Factor IIa = Thrombin (active serine protease)

### Coagulation Cascade

- Definition: Fine-tuned, self-reinforcing process aimed at fibrin formation
- Outline: One distinguishes between two different pathways (extrinsic and intrinsic activation) to trigger the cascade, both of which lead to the same endpoint, where fibrin is formed.
    - Extrinsic pathway (exogenous activation)
    - Intrinsic pathway (endogenous activation)
    - Common end pathway: Formation of fibrin
- Process: Stepwise activation of multiple coagulation factors

#### Extrinsic Pathway of Coagulation (Exogenous Activation)

- Definition: Activation pathway of the plasmatic coagulation triggered by Tissue Factor (tissue thromboplastin = Factor III)
    - Tissue Factor is a transmembrane protein that is produced by subendothelial fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.
- Process: The tissue factor comes into contact with the blood during an endothelial injury and activates factor VII.
- Result: Formation of the extrinsic tenase: Factor III and VIIa form an enzyme complex with phospholipids and Ca2+ ions, the so-called extrinsic tenase.

#### Intrinsic Pathway of Coagulation (Endogenous Activation)

- Process
    1. Activation of factor XII by collagen, kallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen
    2. Activation of factor XI by factor XIIa and thrombin (factor IIa)
    3. Activation of factor IX by factor XIa
    4. Activation of Factor VIII by thrombin (Factor IIa)
- Result: Formation of the intrinsic tenase: Factor IXa and VIIIa form an enzyme complex with phospholipids and Ca2+ ions, the so-called intrinsic tenase.

#### Common endpoint of the extrinsic and intrinsic systems

Both the extrinsic and intrinsic activation pathways converge at the same endpoint, which involves the key reaction of hemostasis: the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, which is the fundamental substance of a blood clot (thrombus).

- Process
    1. Activation of Factor X by the extrinsic and intrinsic tenase
    2. Activation of Factor V by thrombin (Factor IIa)
    3. Conversion of prothrombin (factor II) into thrombin by the factor-Xa-Va complex (prothrombinase), which hydrolytically cleaves the peptide bonds (proteolysis)
    4. Limited proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen (factor I) into fibrin monomers by thrombin (factor IIa)
    5. Activation of Factor XIII by Thrombin (Factor IIa)
    6. Cross-linking of fibrin monomers through covalent bonds between glutamine and lysine residues by activated factor XIIIa, resulting in an insoluble fibrin thrombus.
    7. "Post-coagulation": Shortening of platelet pseudopodia within the fibrin thrombus → Solidification of the thrombus
- Result: Formation of red thrombus (blood clot) → Endothelial defect is sealed → Bleeding ceases

### Cell-Based Model of Coagulation

- Initiation
    - Injury to a blood vessel releases factor III (tissue thromboplastin), which is a membrane protein on fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.
    - Factor III binds to Factor VII and activates it.
    - Complex of factor III and factor VIIa activates factor X
    - Factor Xa activates small amounts of thrombin (thrombin burst)
- Amplification
    - Thrombin activates factors XI, VIII, and V and supports platelet activation.
    - Factor XIa activates Factor IX, which forms a complex with Factor VIIIa.
    - The complex of factor IXa and VIIIa activates factor X.
- Propagation
    - Factor Xa forms a complex with Factor Va.
    - Majority of thrombin production on the platelet surface (thrombin burst)
    - Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen (factor I) into fibrin monomers, which aggregate to form a fibrin network.
    - Crosslinking of the fibrin mesh occurs through covalent bonds between lysine and glutamine residues by factor XIIIa → formation of a secondary coagulation thrombus (red thrombus)

> [!NOTE] Hemophilia A and B
> The condition commonly known as hemophilia, also referred to colloquially as the bleeding disease, is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of clotting factors that leads to a disturbance in blood coagulation. A hereditary factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) is distinguished from a hereditary factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B). Due to the deficiency of factor VIII or IX, secondary hemostasis (plasmatic coagulation) is disrupted along the intrinsic pathway, which results in extensive bleeding (particularly frequent joint bleeding). As with all X-linked recessive inheritance patterns, typically only males are affected!

## Inhibition of Blood Coagulation

### Physiological Coagulation Inhibition

Blood coagulation is a cascading process with several positive feedback loops. Therefore, a counter-regulatory system is necessary to create a balance between coagulation and anticoagulation. In the body, certain proteins from plasma and endothelial cells regulate this process.

#### Antithrombin

- Definition: Plasma protein that is synthesized in the hepatocytes of the liver
    - Decisive factor of physiological inhibition
- Function: Inhibition of thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa
    - Antithrombin functions as a serine protease inhibitor → Blockade of serine in the catalytic center of coagulation factors → Inhibition of their enzymatic activity → Inhibition of secondary hemostasis

#### Thrombomodulin, Protein C, and Protein S

- Definition
    - Thrombomodulin: Transmembrane receptor on endothelial cells
    - Protein C/S-System: Protein C and Protein S are plasma proteins that are synthesized in the liver, dependent on Vitamin K.
- Function
    - Thrombomodulin: Binding of thrombin (factor IIa) leads to two anticoagulant effects
        1. Reduction of the plasma concentration of free thrombin
        2. Activation of the Protein C/S system: Conformational change of thrombin due to binding to thrombomodulin → Highly specific activation of protein C by thrombin
    - Protein C/S-System: Inhibition of factor Va and VIIIa by activated protein C (APC) and its cofactor protein S → Anticoagulant and profibrinolytic effect

#### α1-Antitrypsin

- Definition: Acute-phase protein that is synthesized by hepatocytes and released into the blood.
- Function: Protease Inhibitor → Inhibition of Thrombin (Factor IIa) and Plasmin

#### α2-Macroglobulin

- Definition: Plasma protein that is synthesized in hepatocytes.
- Function: Protease Inhibitor → Inhibition of Thrombin (Factor IIa), Plasmin, and Kallikrein

### Medication-Induced Anticoagulation

#### Heparin

- Definition: Sulfated glycosaminoglycan (polysaccharide made from amino sugars) with varying chain length.
- Mode of action: Complex formation with antithrombin → Conformational change of antithrombin → Amplification of the antithrombin effect by approximately a factor of 1,000
    - Inactivated primarily thrombin and factor Xa
- Antidote: Protamine sulfate

> [!NOTE]
> The effect of heparin occurs quickly (it acts much faster than coumarins)! After subcutaneous injection, heparin has an anticoagulant effect within just a few hours!

#### Coumarin

- Definition: Derivative of the aromatic compound Coumarin
- Mechanism of action: Competitive inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase → Reduction of the synthesis of reduced vitamin K → Vitamin K is lacking as a cofactor for the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of glutamate side chains of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X → Plasma levels of the four factors decrease → Inhibition of secondary hemostasis

> [!NOTE]
> Coagulation factors whose synthesis depends on vitamin K: 1972 (Nine-Ten-Seven-Two) – the year of the Olympic Games in Munich!

> [!NOTE]
> Vitamin K antagonists take effect as anticoagulants only after a few days, as the remaining carboxylated factors must first be depleted!

> [!NOTE]
> Protein C and S are synthesized in a vitamin K-dependent manner. They have a shorter half-life than the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. In the first few days of a coumarin therapy, there is initially an increased tendency to coagulate, which is why heparins are usually used prophylactically in an overlapping manner!

#### Hirudin

- Definition: Polypeptide that can be obtained from the saliva of the medicinal leech "Hirudo medicinalis"
- Mode of action: Inhibition of thrombin (factor IIa) by binding at the active site of the enzyme → Thrombin can no longer activate its substrate fibrinogen.

### Anticoagulation in vitro

The in-vitro inhibitors mentioned here are typically found in blood collection tubes and are used in laboratory medicine and coagulation diagnostics to temporarily make the blood being examined non-coagulable. Laboratory tests for coagulation measure the time it takes for fibrin to form in a blood sample. Therefore, the blood must be controlled and coagulated at a time determined by the examiner (starting point of the timing). This is usually achieved by adding calcium (Ca2+ = Factor IV) and tissue thromboplastin (Tissue factor = Factor III).

- Example substances: EDTA, citrate, oxalate
- Mode of action: Complex formation (EDTA) or anionic binding (citrate, oxalate) with/from Ca2+-cations (coagulation factor IV) → Elimination of this important cofactor from the coagulation cascade → Formation of the coagulation factor complexes (e.g., intrinsic tenase complex) does not occur

> [!NOTE] APC resistance (Factor V Leiden mutation)
> The activated protein C (APC) normally inactivates factor Va together with its cofactor (protein S). In APC resistance, a point mutation in the factor V gene alters the cleavage site for activated protein C so that factor V can no longer be inactivated. This results in an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia).

## Fibrinolysis (= Breakdown of the clot)

Blood coagulation (fibrin formation) and fibrinolysis (fibrin breakdown) occur continuously in parallel within the vascular system. The fibrinolytic system continuously breaks down fibrin.

- Definition: Enzymatic processes in the plasma that lead to the breakdown of the fibrin thrombus.
- Function
    - Prevents unnecessary fibrin formation
    - Breakdown of old thrombi
- Process
    1. Activation of the serine protease plasmin
2. Plasmin cleaves fibrin → formation of soluble peptide fragments (D-dimers)
    3. D-dimer also inhibits thrombin
- Regulation: The regulation of fibrinolysis occurs through the activation or inhibition of the key enzyme plasmin.

|Activation of Fibrinolysis (Fibrinolytics)|   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Name|Origin|Mode of Action|
|Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)|- Endothelium<br>    - Facilitates fibrin breakdown in the blood<br>- Also used as a medication (recombinant t-PA = rt-PA)|Serine protease: Cleaves plasminogen to plasmin|
|Urokinase (u-PA)|- Epithelial cells of the renal tubules<br>    - Responsible for the degradation of fibrin in the urine<br>- Also used as a medication (urokinase obtained from cell culture or produced recombinantly)|
|Streptokinase|- Bacteria (Streptococci)<br>- Used as a medication (streptokinase obtained from bacterial culture)|“Activator complex” with plasminogen|
|Inhibition of Fibrinolysis (Antifibrinolytics)|   |   |
|PAI-1|- Endothelial<br>- Platelets|Inhibitor of several serine proteases: Inhibits t-PA and u-PA|
|α2-Antiplasmin|- Hepatocytes|Plasmin Inhibitor: α2-Antiplasmin forms an inactive complex with plasmin|
|Tranexamic Acid|- Medication for the inhibition of fibrinolysis|Plasmin Inhibitor|
|ε-Aminocaproic acid| - Synthetic chemical compound for the inhibition of fibrinolysis|

> [!NOTE]
> Thrombin builds up fibrin, its most important inhibitor is antithrombin! Plasmin breaks down fibrin, its most important inhibitors are α2-antiplasmin and PAI-1!

> [!NOTE] Medical fibrinolysis
> A pathological blood coagulation can lead to acute blockages of arterial vessels, resulting in severe health conditions. These include heart attack, stroke, or pulmonary embolism. In the mentioned cases, therapeutic "thrombolysis," meaning the dissolution of the clot with the help of special medications ("fibrinolytics"), can be beneficial in order to save as much tissue as possible from destruction due to hypoxia. Fibrinolytics include streptokinase and urokinase, which are obtained from bacterial and renal cell cultures, respectively. Currently, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), produced in genetically modified animal cell cultures, is primarily used for fibrinolysis.

## Coagulation Tests

The various laboratory chemical tests each capture specific sections of the coagulation system. Together, they usually provide insight into the cause of a blood coagulation disorder.

### Diagnosis of Disorders of Primary Hemostasis

- Platelet count in the blood
- Bleeding time

### Diagnosis of Disorders of Secondary Hemostasis

## Review Questions on the Chapter Hemostasis and Blood Coagulation
### Platelets

How long is the average lifespan of a platelet and where does its breakdown occur?
- The average lifespan of a platelet is 5–12 days. Breakdown occurs through macrophages in the red pulp of the spleen.
What commonality exists between platelets and red blood cells regarding their cellular components?
- Both platelets and red blood cells do not have a nucleus.
Describe the shape of an inactive platelet. What maintains this shape and how does it change upon activation?
- The platelet has a biconvex shape at rest, which is maintained by the microtubules of the cytoskeleton. After activation of platelets, the microtubules are restructured. Additionally, numerous cytoplasmic extensions (so-called pseudopodia) form.
How does a platelet gain energy?
- Platelets, like most body cells, possess mitochondria and can synthesize ATP through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the respiratory chain.
Which components of the platelet granules cause the activation of additional platelets after their release, in the sense of positive feedback?
- Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and serotonin are components of the δ-granules and promote the activation and degranulation of further platelets by binding as messenger substances to platelet receptors. Serotonin also promotes vasoconstriction and thereby additionally contributes to blood clotting.
### Primary Hemostasis (Cellular Hemostasis)

What is the function of von Willebrand factor in the first step of hemostasis?
- When an injury causes damage to the endothelium, von Willebrand factor binds to collagen exposed there as well as to the GP1b receptor (von Willebrand factor receptor) on the surface of platelets. This causes rapid adhesion of the platelets to the damaged endothelium.
What effect does the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) from platelet granules have?
- After its release from activated platelets, ADP binds to extracellular receptors on the platelet membrane and promotes the formation of pseudopodia as well as the synthesis of thromboxane A2; both support platelet aggregation.
Which protein links activated platelets together into a dense network during platelet aggregation?
- Fibrinogen molecules are able to link two platelets each by binding to their fibrinogen receptors, resulting in dense crosslinking of platelets.
What subunits make up the fibrinogen receptor of the platelet membrane?
- The fibrinogen receptor on platelets consists of a complex of the glycoproteins GPIIb and GPIIIa. It can bind fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor.
Where is Thromboxane A2 produced and what effect does it have on blood coagulation?
- Thromboxane A2 is produced in activated platelets and promotes their aggregation. It acts vasoconstrictively on the vessels.
Where is prostacyclin produced and what effect does it have on blood coagulation?
- Prostacyclin is continuously produced by intact endothelial cells and has a strong inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation and activation. It also acts vasodilatively and thereby hinders platelet adhesion to the endothelium.
### Secondary Hemostasis (Plasmatic Hemostasis)

What is the Tissue Factor and what is it also called?
- Tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin = factor III) is a transmembrane protein and is expressed by subendothelial fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.
Describe the extrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis up to the common final pathway.
- Secondary hemostasis is initiated at a lesion of the vascular endothelium through direct contact of tissue factor and blood. This activates coagulation factor VII, which then forms an enzyme complex (the so-called extrinsic tenase) together with factor III, calcium ions, and phospholipids. This complex subsequently activates factor X by enzymatic cleavage.
What is the composition of the enzyme complex "prothrombinase" and what reaction does it catalyze?
- Prothrombinase is a complex of activated factors X and V (Xa and Va), phospholipids, and calcium ions, and converts prothrombin (factor II) into thrombin (factor IIa) in the common final pathway of the coagulation cascade.
Thrombin ist biochemisch ein Serinprotease-Enzym, das die Umwandlung von Fibrinogen in Fibrin katalysiert.
- Thrombin is a protease that cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin by limited proteolysis.
Through the covalent bond between which amino acid residues of two neighboring fibrin molecules does an insoluble fibrin thrombus ultimately form? Which coagulation factor catalyzes this reaction?
- One of the final steps of secondary hemostasis is the crosslinking of fibrin monomers by covalent bonds between lysine and glutamine residues. This stabilization is catalyzed by factor XIIIa (the so-called fibrin-stabilizing factor).
### Inhibition of Blood Coagulation

What is the Protein C/S system and how is it activated?
- The protein C/S system is part of physiological coagulation inhibition that counters excessive blood clotting. Protein C is activated by thrombin after its binding to the transmembrane endothelial cell receptor thrombomodulin. The complex of activated protein C and its cofactor protein S inactivates coagulation factors Va and VIIIa.
What is heparin biochemically?
- Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (polysaccharide made of amino sugars) of variable length.
How does heparin exert its anticoagulant effect?
- Heparin is a cofactor of the physiological coagulation inhibitor antithrombin. When heparin binds to antithrombin, it causes a conformational change in antithrombin, which thereby more strongly inhibits the protease activity of factors IIa and Xa.
When can the onset of action of heparin be expected after subcutaneous injection?
- The anticoagulant effect of heparin occurs within a few hours after subcutaneous administration.
The synthesis of which coagulation factors is dependent on vitamin K, and in which step of the synthesis is it required as a cofactor?
- Factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X require vitamin K for the carboxylation of glutamate side chains.
How do vitamin K antagonists (so-called coumarins) work?
- Vitamin K antagonists act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase. Only reduced vitamin K can serve as a cofactor in the carboxylation of glutamate residues of coagulation factors. Inhibition of the enzyme reduces the synthesis of these factors in the liver and thereby inhibits secondary hemostasis.
### Fibrinolysis (Breakdown of the Clot)

Which is the key enzyme of fibrinolysis and what reaction does it catalyze?
- The key enzyme of fibrinolysis is the serine protease plasmin. It catalyzes the dissolution of the fibrin thrombus by cleaving fibrin into its degradation products.
Name two body-owned activators of fibrinolysis and describe their mechanism of action.
- Urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) are proteases that cleave the plasmin precursor plasminogen into plasmin and thereby activate it. Plasmin can then dissolve fibrin thrombi.
Name an example where the activators of fibrinolysis can also be used medically.
- The body's own activators of fibrinolysis, tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase, can also be produced recombinantly in cell cultures. Thus, they can be used clinically, for example, to dissolve an acute arterial occlusion caused by a blood clot.
Who is the direct "opponent" of plasmin?
- α2-antiplasmin is an inhibitor of plasmin that inactivates the enzyme by complex formation.
### Coagulation Tests

Assign the following coagulation parameters to the respective phases of hemostasis: bleeding time, Quick value, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
- Bleeding time checks the function of primary hemostasis; the latter two coagulation parameters examine the function of secondary hemostasis, whereby the Quick value tests factors of the extrinsic system and the aPTT tests those of the intrinsic system.
In what cases can there be an isolated prolongation of bleeding time?
- Bleeding time provides information about platelet function. A prolongation can thus be caused by a deficiency of platelets (thrombocytopenia) or by a functional disorder (e.g., deficiency of thromboxane A2).
Which coagulation parameters are altered in a deficiency of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors?
- The synthesis of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X is vitamin K-dependent. Factor VII belongs to the extrinsic system, factor IX to the intrinsic system, and factors X and II are part of the common final pathway. They can all be reduced, for example, in the context of anticoagulation therapy with coumarins, which primarily leads to a change in the Quick value (↓) and the INR value (↑). In severe vitamin K deficiency, due to factor IX deficiency, impairment of the intrinsic system with prolongation of the aPTT may also occur. An isolated reduction of factor IX (as in hemophilia B) would primarily lead to a prolonged aPTT.
In which hereditary disease is there an isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and which coagulation factors are typically affected?
- In hemophilia (also called bleeding disease), there is a disorder of coagulation factors of the intrinsic system of secondary hemostasis that causes an isolated prolongation of the aPTT. In hemophilia A, there is a deficiency of factor VIII; in hemophilia B, factor IX is lacking.
How does a deficiency of fibrin-stabilizing factor (XIII) affect coagulation tests?
- The fibrin-stabilizing factor ensures stable crosslinking of the fibrin thrombus after coagulation has occurred. Therefore, it does not influence the thromboplastin time (Quick value, INR) or the partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), so a deficiency cannot be detected with the usual coagulation tests.
