# Stress Models
## Summary

Stress occurs when there is an imbalance between external demands and personal coping abilities. The following will present both the physiological and psychological reactions to stress. In this context, particular attention is given to the various stress models that all address the emergence of stress and the human reaction to stress.
## Terms

- Definition of "stress": Imbalance between external demands (stressors) and personal coping abilities
    - Eustress: The demands can be managed and are perceived positively.
    - Distress: The demands can be difficult to manage and are perceived as a burden.
        - Separation distress: Depression and the feeling of helplessness after separations
- Stress state: Consists of two components
    1. Stressor: Stimulus that represents a demand
        - Environmental stressors: For example, high performance demands from the environment
        - Psychological stressors: For example, time pressure, sensory overload, high personal performance demands, critical life events
        - Physical stressors: For example, illness, lack of sleep
    2. Stress reaction: Specific adaptive response to the stressor
- Diathesis (Vulnerability): Individual sensitivity to stressors
    - Diathesis-Stress Model: Diseases arise from an interaction between the diathesis and stressors.

> [!NOTE] Endogenous Opioids in Social Bonds
> Endogenous Opioids are opioids produced by the body Opioids (e.g. Endorphins) that trigger positive feelings in social relationships. These feelings can also be artificially induced through exogenous Opioids without contact with other people, which is why individuals dependent on opioids often withdraw from their peers. Due to the positive effects of endogenous Opioids, they also alleviate negative feelings such as separation distress.

## Reaction to Stress

Stress as an imbalance between external demands and personal coping resources triggers both physiological and psychological reactions. Psychophysiology, as a subfield of psychology, deals with the relationships between physiological and psychological processes. The following sections will introduce the various adaptation reactions to stress, with particular reference to some "stress models."

### Physiological Reaction to Stress

The body responds to stress by releasing various hormones (e.g., glucocorticoids, catecholamines, thyroid hormones) as well as activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

- Homeostasis-Allostasis Model: Through adaptive responses or a setpoint shift (allostasis), the balance between the individual and the environment (so-called homeostasis) can be maintained. The physiological changes (e.g., increased cortisol levels) as a reaction to stress are temporarily necessary and helpful to adequately respond to stimuli. However, with prolonged stress, the altered physiological processes can negatively impact health and lead to somatic damage.

#### Activation and Awareness States

Depending on the situation a person is exposed to, their body is at different activation levels. For example, in response to a new, unexpected stimulus, the body exhibits an orienting response, the activation level increases, and the body is (ideally) prepared to respond to the stimulus. The activation level thus influences the performance capacity of an organism. The exact relationship between activation and performance is described by the Yerkes-Dodson law.

- Orientation reaction
    - Focusing concentration on a new, unexpected stimulus in order to be able to react to it
    - Elements of the orienting response :
        - Increase in heart and respiratory rate
        - Increase in blood pressure
        - Increase in muscle tension
        - Increase in blink frequency
        - Peripheral vasoconstriction and central vasodilation
        - Pupil dilation
        - Decrease in skin resistance, increase in skin conductivity (skin resistance = reciprocal of skin conductivity)
            - Objectifiable through measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA)
        - Diminution of the stimulus threshold
        - Beta waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG): Alpha blockade
- Yerkes-Dodson Law
    - Describes the relationship between activation and performance
    - The performance is ideal at moderate activation.
    - With lower or higher activation, performance declines.

### Stress Models

There are various models and concepts that deal with the emergence of stress and the human response to stress. The following presents a selection.

#### Transactional Stress Model (Coping Model) by Lazarus

According to the transactional model of stress developed by American psychologist Richard Lazarus in the 1970s, stress does not arise solely from a stimulus, but rather through the evaluation and interpretation of the situation in which the stimulus occurs. The model is divided into four phases, with the actual coping attempt (= Coping) taking place during the first three phases.

#### General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) by Selye

The AAS describes the physiological response to stressors. It assumes that the response, regardless of the type of stressor, is always the same.

#### Psychoendocrine Stress Model by Henry

According to the psychoendocrine stress model, stress can evoke various emotions that lead to different behaviors with specific endocrine reaction patterns.

| Anger/Fury                           | - Fight Reaction                     | - Norepinephrine↑<br>- Testosterone↑ |
| Anxiety                              | - Flight response                    | - Adrenaline↑                        |
| Depression                           | - Subordination<br>- Loss of control | - Cortisol↑<br>- Testosterone↓       |

#### Other Concepts

- Concept of reaction specificity: Describes how people respond to stress.
    - Individual-specific hypothesis: People respond to various stimuli (stressors) always specifically with the same response, which can differ between individuals.
    - Stimulus-specific hypothesis: Certain stressors trigger the same reaction in different people.
- Concept of critical life events: Life changes of a negative or positive nature require an adaptation effort.
    - Objective measurement of stress using the Social Readjustment Scale
    - Psychosocial protective factors help to cope with critical life events, psychosocial risk factors make coping more difficult.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Stress Models
### Terms

What is meant by "diathesis" or "vulnerability"?
- Diathesis or vulnerability refers to the individual sensitivity to stressors.
Which neurotransmitters produced by the body play an important role in pain and distress processing?
- Pain and negative feelings such as, for example, separation distress can be mitigated by endogenous opioids – that is, opioids produced by the body.

### Reaction to Stress

What does the homeostasis-allostasis model describe?
- The homeostasis-allostasis model describes that physiological adjustments – i.e., shifts in the set points of physiological parameters – may be necessary as a response to stress to restore a balance between the individual and the environment (a so-called homeostasis). This adjustment reaction is also called "allostasis." However, in the long term, this regulation by the body can lead to problems. For example, cortisone is needed and helpful in the short term to respond appropriately to stress, but in the long term, it can lead to the immune system being weakened.
What is the purpose of a so-called orienting response of the body? Name some examples of which parameters of the body change in this context!
- When a person is confronted with a new, unexpected stimulus, a so-called orienting response of the body occurs, which directs concentration to this stimulus so that the person can react to it. For example, heart rate and respiratory rate, blood pressure, and muscle tension increase, and skin resistance decreases (which in turn increases skin conductance). In the EEG, alpha waves are replaced by beta waves (so-called alpha blocking). Additionally, the response threshold for the corresponding sense that perceived the stimulus lowers. For instance, with a visual stimulus, the response threshold of the visual system decreases by the pupils dilating, and even a slight amount of light is sufficient to perceive a visual stimulus.
What does the Yerkes-Dodson law describe?
- The Yerkes-Dodson law states that a person's performance is highest at a medium level of activation or arousal and decreases at lower or higher levels of activation. In a graph, this relationship can be represented as an inverted U-curve: with low arousal, a person performs below their potential, performance increases with rising arousal until it becomes too strong and performance declines again.
Name the four phases of the transactional stress model by Lazarus and briefly explain what happens in each phase!
- The transactional stress model by Lazarus describes that stress does not arise solely from a stimulus but only through the appraisal. There are four phases: First comes the primary appraisal, where a quick initial assessment occurs to determine whether the event is positive or negative or relevant or irrelevant. After this, the secondary appraisal follows, in which one's own coping possibilities are evaluated. Next is the so-called coping, the attempt to manage the situation, followed by a reappraisal after the coping attempt.
