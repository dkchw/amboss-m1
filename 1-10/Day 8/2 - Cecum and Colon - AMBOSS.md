# Cecum and colon
## Summary

Cecum and colon represent the first sections of the large intestine, with the cecum being the most proximal area. Here, the ileum, as the final section of the small intestine, empties into the Bauhin's valve. Additionally, the cecum has a small, worm-like outpouching: the vermiform appendix. The colon is the longest part of the large intestine and can be divided into four sections based on its course. The primary function of the cecum and colon is the reabsorption of water and consequently the thickening of the chyme. At approximately the level of the sacrum, the colon transitions into the rectum, which together with the anal canal serves as a continence organ. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the small and large intestine in the section on microscopic anatomy.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

The loops of the cecum and colon surround the small intestine within the abdominal cavity, with the cecum having a small, worm-like protrusion: the vermiform appendix.

### Profile

- Function: Thickening of the food slurry through water resorption
- Location: Intra- and secondary retroperitoneal
- Form: Frame-shaped around the small intestine
- Length: 120–135 cm

### Structure

The colon can be divided into four sections based on its course. Macroscopically, the cecum and colon have some typical features that distinguish them from the small intestine.

#### Shares

- Cecum with the vermiform appendix
- Colon
    1. Ascending colon
    2. Transverse colon
    3. Descending colon
    4. Sigmoid colon

#### Macroscopic Features

The wall structure of the colon and cecum exhibits some special features that are already macroscopically visible: The longitudinal muscle layer is shaped into three band-like strips (so-called taeniae), to which fatty appendages (appendices epiploicae) are attached. Additionally, circular wall folds (so-called plicae semilunares) appear in the interior of the intestinal tube during muscle contraction, between which outpouchings (so-called haustra) can be seen.

- Taenia coli: Three longitudinal bundles of muscle that are formed from the longitudinal layer of the muscularis tunic.
    - Taenia omentalis: Fused with the greater omentum
    - Taenia libera: Free-floating, visible from the outside
    - Taenia mesocolica: Fused with the mesentery of the transverse colon
- Appendices epiploicae: Fat tags of the subserous tissue in the area of the taeniae
- Semilunar folds: Protrusions of all wall layers that project into the lumen in a crescent shape.
    - Occur only during muscle tension
    - Run according to the circular layer of the muscular coat.
- Haustra (Haustrae coli): Outpouchings of the intestinal wall between the semilunar folds

### Topography

#### Cecum and vermiform appendix

The cecum connects to the ileum at the Bauhin valve (syn. ileocecal valve) and forms the first section of the large intestine. Caudally, its lumen narrows to the smaller lumen of the vermiform appendix, and cranially it transitions into the ascending colon. Both the cecum and the vermiform appendix are variable in their position.

- Hello
    - Location: Variable intra- or secondary retroperitoneal
    - Course: From the Bauhin's valve cranially to the ascending colon
    - Length: 5–7 cm
    - Special features: Often, there is a space behind the cecum (retrocecal recess), which contains the vermiform appendix in most people.
- Vermiform appendix
    - Location: Intraperitoneal with variable position
        - Elevated behind the cecum (=ascending retrocecal position): 64%
        - Pulling caudally into the small basin (=descending position): 31%
        - Horizontal behind the cecum running (=transverse retrocecal position): 2%
        - Located in front of the ileum (=ascending paracolic, preiliacal position): 1%
        - Located behind the ileum (= ascending paracecal, retroiliac position): 0.5%
    - Length: Also variable, usually about 8 cm
    - Special features: At the exit of the vermiform appendix, the three taeniae converge and cover them with a uniform layer of longitudinal muscle.

> [!NOTE]
> Despite the various courses, the origin of the vermiform appendix from the cecum is relatively constant!

#### Colon

The colon is divided into four sections, each of which has a different relationship with the peritoneal cavity.

||Ascending colon|Transverse colon|Descending colon|Sigmoid colon|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Peritoneal relationship|- Secondary retroperitoneal|- Intraperitoneal|- Secondary retroperitoneal|- Intraperitoneal|
|Peritoneal ligaments|- Directly fused with the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity|- Transverse mesocolon|- Directly fused with the posterior wall of the abdominal cavity|- Sigmoid mesocolon|
|Course|- Extends from the right lower abdomen to the right colon flexure (flexura coli dextra)|- Runs transversely across the abdominal cavity from the right colon flexure (flexura coli dextra) to the left colon flexure (flexura coli sinistra)|- Extends from the left colon flexure (flexura coli sinistra) down to the left iliac fossa|- Extends from the iliac crest in an S-shaped loop to the third sacral vertebra|
|Length|- 12–20 cm|- About 45 cm|- About 22–30 cm|- About 40 cm|

> [!NOTE]
> The left colon flexure is always positioned higher than the right flexure due to its fixation by the phrenicocolic ligament to the diaphragm!

> [!NOTE] Diverticulosis
> In the colon (especially in the sigmoid colon), some people have small bulges (diverticula) of mucosa and submucosa through weak muscle areas of the intestinal wall. This is called diverticulosis. There is often a connection with a low-fiber diet, constipation, and lack of exercise, which is why it is also referred to as a disease of Western industrialized countries. Clinically, the disease often only becomes apparent through bleeding or inflammation of the diverticula (diverticulitis). In this colloquially referred to as "left appendicitis," patients suffer from left lower abdominal pain (up to acute abdomen), fever, and bloody-mucous stools. If diverticulitis is uncomplicated, patients can often be treated with antibiotic therapy; however, in more complicated cases, surgery to remove the affected section of the intestine may be necessary.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

The zäkum and colon are supplied depending on the section by branches of the A. mesenterica superior or A. mesenterica inferior. Like all other parts of the intestinal tube, they are also supplied by the autonomously functioning enteric nervous system. There is also a sympathetic and a parasympathetic supply. However, the parasympathetic supply from the N. vagus only goes up to the left colic flexure (to the so-called "Cannon-Böhm point"). From this point on, the Nn. splanchnici pelvici take over the parasympathetic innervation.

> [!NOTE]
> The area from which the pelvic splanchnic nerves, rather than the vagus nerve, take over the parasympathetic innervation is called the Cannon-Böhm point!

> [!NOTE]
> The A. colica media and A. colica sinistra form the so-called Riolan anastomosis slightly medial to the left colonic flexure!

> [!NOTE] Paralytic ileus
> In the case of a so-called paralytic ileus, it is a disorder of intestinal passage due to intestinal paralysis. Various factors, such as a blockage of the mesenteric vessels, inflammation, or trauma, can lead to paralysis of the intestine and thus to an inhibition of peristalsis. In the further course, the intestinal wall expands due to the accumulated intestinal contents; subsequently, fluid and bacteria can pass through the wall into the abdominal cavity. If this is not timely prevented with therapy (e.g., gastric tube or surgery), it can lead to a life-threatening hypovolemic (due to fluid loss) or septic (due to bacteria) shock. The paralytic ileus is contrasted with the mechanical ileus, which is caused by a mechanical obstruction in the intestinal lumen.

## Microscopic Anatomy

The colon and cecum exhibit a typical layering for the digestive tract in the tunica mucosa, tela submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica adventitia (when retroperitoneal) or tunica serosa (when intraperitoneal) (see also: overview of the digestive system). A special feature is the stratum longitudinale, as it is formed into band-like strips (taeniae) in the colon and cecum, which come together on the vermiform appendix.

### Colon and Cecum

- Special Features
    - In addition to the normal epithelium, there are many goblet cells and so-called colonocytes.
    - High transepithelial resistance of the epithelium (tight epithelium with low ion permeability) → Absorption of water
    - The mucous membrane has crypts but no villi.
    - Many lymph follicles in the tela submucosa
    - Uniform circular stratum and interrupted longitudinal stratum

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to the small intestine, the cecum and colon have only crypts and no villi!

### Vermiform Appendix

In its basic structure, the wall of the appendix vermiformis corresponds to the rest of the colon wall. However, one difference is the stratum longitudinale: In this section, it is not reduced to taeniae, but instead forms a complete layer around the appendix vermiformis. Additionally, the lymph follicles are particularly well-developed.

- Special Features
    - Uniform longitudinal stratum, no taeniae
    - Very large accumulation of lymph follicles that can penetrate the entire submucosal layer.

## Function

The digestion is completed at the end of the ileum, as from here no further absorption of nutrients occurs. The cecum and colon are primarily responsible for the reabsorption of water and thus for the thickening of the chyme. Additionally, mucus is produced in these sections to make the chyme more lubricated for further transport. In the colon, there are also bacteria that further break down the food and produce various substances. The vermiform appendix also fulfills an immunological function.

### Colon and Cecum

- Water resorption: Reabsorption of sodium and release of potassium (Na+/K+ exchange) → Water follows sodium.
- Mucus production: Better lubricity of the chyme
- Bacteria: In particular, anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Clostridium)
    - The bacteria further break down the food components.
        - This results in gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia)
        - The toxic substances produced (e.g. ammonia) must be detoxified in the liver again.
    - Some bacteria, such as E. coli, are capable of producing vitamin K (though in very small concentrations, so it plays a secondary role in human nutrition)

> [!NOTE]
> The colon has the highest bacterial density within the human body!

### Vermiform Appendix

The vermiform appendix is a protrusion of the cecum that has been transformed into a lymphatic organ. It has a "guarding function" at the transition from the small intestine to the large intestine, which is why the vermiform appendix is also referred to as the "intestinal tonsil."

- Immunological function: Through many secondary lymphoid follicles

> [!NOTE] Appendicitis
> Appendicitis refers to an inflammation of the vermiform appendix. Colloquially, it is often referred to as "appendicitis," which is not accurate, as "appendix" refers to the entire cecum. The most common cause of appendicitis is a blockage, leading to a buildup of stool remnants in the vermiform appendix. Affected individuals usually initially experience diffuse pain around the belly button, which then migrates to the lower right abdomen over time. Accompanying symptoms may include fever, nausea, and vomiting. Since the origin of the vermiform appendix from the cecum is relatively constant, there are specific pressure points for this location that can exacerbate pain during appendicitis. This includes, for example, the McBurney point (a point on the line between the right anterior superior iliac spine and the belly button, situated between the lateral and middle third) or the Lanz point (a point on the line between both iliac spines, located between the right and middle third). Appendicitis must typically be treated with an appendectomy (surgical removal of the vermiform appendix) in severe cases. In uncomplicated cases, however, conservative therapy consisting of bed rest, dietary restrictions, and antibiotic administration may be sufficient.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Cecum and Colon
### Macroscopic Anatomy

What are the macroscopic features of the cecum and colon?
- The wall structure of the cecum and colon shows some already macroscopically visible peculiarities: The longitudinal muscle layer is present in the form of three band-like strips (= taeniae), on which fat appendages of the tela subserosa (= appendices epiploicae) are located. When the smooth intestinal muscle contracts, circular wall folds also appear in the lumen (= plicae semilunares); from the outside, the intervening outpouchings (= haustra) can be seen.

Name the four sections of the colon. Which section extends the farthest cranially?
- The four sections of the colon from proximal to distal are: ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. The left colic flexure lies the most cranially due to its fixation by the phrenicocolic ligament at the diaphragm.

Which sections of the colon are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and which by the inferior mesenteric artery? Which branches of the two vessels form a well-known anastomosis?
- The vascular supply of the entire colon is provided by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. The superior mesenteric artery, with its branches, is responsible for supplying the intestinal sections up to the transverse colon. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the distal transverse colon, the descending and sigmoid colon, as well as the upper rectum. The middle colic artery (from the superior mesenteric artery) and the left colic artery (from the inferior mesenteric artery) form the so-called Riolan’s anastomosis in the area of the left colic flexure.

### Microscopic Anatomy

What is the essential histological distinguishing feature between the small and large intestine?
- The essential feature by which a histological preparation of the large intestine can be distinguished from that of the small intestine is the absence of villi. These occur exclusively in the small intestine. Crypts and goblet cells, however, are found in both the small and large intestines.

What are the histological features of the vermiform appendix compared to the rest of the colon?
- In its basic structure, the wall of the vermiform appendix corresponds to that of the rest of the large intestinal wall. However, its longitudinal muscle layer is not arranged as band-like taeniae but as a uniform layer. Because the vermiform appendix also fulfills an immunological function, the lymph follicles are particularly well developed here.

### Function

Where is the McBurney point and what does pain upon pressure there indicate?
- The McBurney point lies between the lateral and middle third of the line between the right anterior superior iliac spine and the navel. It is typically very tender upon pressure in appendicitis.

Where in the body is the highest physiological bacterial density located, and what functions do the bacteria perform there?
- The highest physiological bacterial density in the body is located in the colon. The bacteria there primarily help with the further breakdown of food. Some are additionally capable of producing vitamin K.
