# Embryonic Development
## Summary

As embryonic development, the prenatal development until the end of the 8th week of development is referred to. This time is very eventful, as fundamental developmental steps are taken, on the basis of which organ development later takes place. After the implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining, the embryo consists of embryoblast and trophoblast. While the embryoblast further develops into various embryological body structures, the trophoblast is primarily involved in the formation of the prenatal supply system. At the very beginning of the second week, the embryoblast further differentiates into epiblast and hypoblast, creating the bilaminar germ disc. During this time, the amniotic cavity and yolk sac as well as the extraembryonic mesoderm and the later chorionic cavity (= extraembryonic coelom) are formed. In the third and fourth weeks, the differentiation of the bilaminar to the trilaminar germ disc occurs during gastrulation. From the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm), various structures arise that are documented in the developmental plan. The nervous system also develops during these weeks. In the so-called neurulation, the neural tube and neural crest are formed from the ectoderm after stimulation with signaling molecules from the notochord. Furthermore, during this time, the body axes are established, and the embryonic structure reaches a three-dimensional form through cranio-caudal and lateral folding. The fifth to eighth week is primarily characterized by the formation of the still missing organs and the further differentiation of the embryonic tissue.
## Early Development (2nd Week)

After implantation in the first week, the germ consists of the embryoblast and trophoblast. The embryoblast further differentiates in the second week, resulting in the formation of two layers known as the epiblast and hypoblast. The area where the two layers lie on top of each other is referred to as the bilaminar germ disc. From this germ disc, cells migrate out to create two cavities, known as the amniotic cavity (formed by the epiblast) and yolk sac (formed by the hypoblast). Since the trophoblast grows faster compared to the amniotic cavity and yolk sac, a third cavity (chorionic cavity) is formed, which is lined by extraembryonic mesoderm. In addition to the development of the germ disc, the uteroplacental circulation also develops in the second week.

- Outline
    1. Development of the two-leaf germ disk
    2. Formation of the amniotic cavity and yolk sac
    3. Emigration of the extraembryonic mesoderm
- Duration: Days 8–14
- Goal: The embryonic structure develops from the blastocyst through further differentiation, consisting of a bilaminar germ disc, amniotic cavity, and yolk sac.

### The two-leaf germ disc

Directly after implantation, the embryoblast differentiates into two adjacent cell layers, which together are referred to as the bilaminar germ disc. After the formation of the amniotic cavity and yolk sac, the bilaminar germ disc is situated exactly in between.

- Epiblast: Cells that border the trophoblast.
- Hypoblast: Cells that border the blastocyst cavity

> [!NOTE]
> From the epiblast, all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) as well as all embryonic tissue arise, including the amniotic cavity! The extraembryonic mesoderm and the yolk sac arise from the hypoblast!

### Formation of the Amniotic Cavity and Yolk Sac

From the newly formed two-layered embryonic disc, cells subsequently migrate out, forming a cavity around the epiblast and hypoblast.

#### Formation of the Amniotic Cavity

The amniotic cavity is formed by cells of the epiblast.

- Primary amniotic cavity: Space between epiblast and trophoblast
- Secondary amniotic cavity
    - It arises from the emigration of epiblast cells (= amnioblasts) along the trophoblast, such that the primary amniotic cavity is lined by amnioblasts.
    - A closed liquid-filled space (= amniotic cavity) is formed

#### Formation of the Yolk Sac

The yolk sac is formed by cells of the hypoblast.

- Primary yolk sac: It arises from the lateral migration of hypoblast cells (= yolk sac epithelium), so that the former blastocyst cavity is lined by yolk sac epithelium.
- Secondary yolk sac: By constricting a part of the primary yolk sac, it reduces in size to the secondary yolk sac by the end of the second week.

> [!NOTE]
> The two-layered germ disc now forms the separating layer between the yolk sac and the amniotic cavity!

### Migration of the extraembryonic mesoderm

- Initial situation: The amniotic cavity and primary yolk sac are surrounded by the trophoblast.
- Course
    - Splitting between the trophoblast (outer) and amniotic cavity as well as the primary yolk sac (inner), as the trophoblast grows significantly faster.
    - The blastocoel is lined by extraembryonic mesoderm.
    - Through renewed cleavage in the extraembryonic mesoderm, a new cavity is formed, and the extraembryonic mesoderm divides into two layers connected by the stalk.
        - Parietal leaf: Covers the trophoblast
        - Extraembryonic coelom (= chorionic cavity)
            - Cavity that forms in the extraembryonic mesoderm and remains between the two layers
            - Lined by the so-called chorionic cavity from the middle egg membrane (= chorion, consisting of parietal layer + trophoblast)
        - Visceral layer: Surrounds the amniotic cavity and yolk sac with the intervening embryonic disc.
        - Stalk: Remains as a bridge between the parietal and visceral layers → Later part of the umbilical cord

> [!NOTE]
> The extraembryonic coelom corresponds to the chorionic cavity, which is lined by the middle egg membrane (= chorion, consisting of the parietal layer of the extraembryonic mesoderm and the trophoblast).

## Gastrulation, Neurulation, and Morphogenesis (3rd-4th Week)

During the third and fourth week, the embryonic structure continues to differentiate. The three germ layers form and blood formation in the mesenchyme of the yolk sac begins. Additionally, the nervous system and the gut tube are established. By the fourth week, the future body shape of the embryo develops through the lateral folding of the germ disc and the formation of limb buds. The first intra-embryonic blood vessels and the heart structure as the basis of the primordial circulatory system also arise. In the cranial region of the embryo, the pharyngeal arches, lens placode, and otic pits are formed.

- Outline
    - Prerequisites for gastrulation: primitive streak and primitive node
    - Gastrulation
    - Prerequisite for neurulation: Notochord
    - Neurulation
    - Morphogenesis
    - Differentiation of the germ disc
- Duration: 15th–28th day
- Goal: Further differentiation of the embryo and formation of the first organ rudiments.
    - Pharyngeal arches
    - Lens plaque
    - Dimples
    - Primordial circulatory system with heart formation and first intraembryonic blood vessels
    - Drain pipe
    - Nervous system
## Prerequisites for Gastrulation: Primitive Streak and Primitive Node

The primitive streak forms as an elongated cell condensation in the median plane of the epiblast. Together with the primitive node and the structures derived from it, it creates the prerequisite for the development of the trilaminar germ disc.

- Definition
    - Primitive streak: Elongated cell condensation in the median plane of the epiblast.
    - Primitive node: Rounded cell condensation at the cranial end of the primitive streak
- Associated Structures
    - Primitive groove: Elongated indentation in the primitive stripe
    - Primitive pit: Point-shaped depression in the primitive node
- Function
    - Prerequisite for the formation of the trilaminar germ disc
    - Definition of the cranio-caudal body axis

> [!NOTE]
> The primitive streak establishes the cranio-caudal body axis, and the primitive node defines the cranial pole!

## Gastrulation

During gastrulation, the three-layered germ disc is formed by the migration of epiblast cells. Starting from the epiblast, cells migrate between the epiblast and hypoblast and become the intraembryonic mesoderm. The hypoblast is completely displaced by cells of the epiblast, from which the endoderm subsequently develops. The original epiblast becomes the ectoderm.

- Definition: Migration of epiblast cells (invagination) between the epiblast and hypoblast, as well as the displacement of the hypoblast, so that the three-layered germ disc can form.
- Starting point: Primitive streak as an elongated thickening of the epiblast
- Goal: Formation of the trilaminar germ disk (Mesoderm, Endoderm, and Ectoderm)
- Process
    - Formation of mesoderm (intraembryonic mesoderm)
        - Epiblast cells beneath the primitive streak detach from the cell group and transform into mesoderm cells (= epithelial-mesenchymal transformation)
        - Mesoderm cells migrate into the primitive groove that has formed.
        - Spread of the cells on both sides of the primitive streak and the formation of a new layer between the epiblast and hypoblast, the so-called mesoderm
    - Formation of Endoderm
        - Epiblast cells migrate from the primitive streak and primitive node into the hypoblast layer.
        - Epiblast cells completely displace the hypoblast cells and form another germ layer, the so-called endoderm.
    - Origin of Ectoderm: Differentiation of the remaining epiblast cell layer into ectoderm

> [!NOTE]
> All the embryonic tissue originates from the epiblast!

## Prerequisite for Neurulation: The Notochord

The notochord develops parallel to the trilaminar germ disc from the notochordal process. It serves as the guiding structure for the formation of the nervous system. Relics of the notochord are the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.

- Definition: Tube-like invagination between ectoderm and endoderm, which is considered a guiding structure for the formation of the nervous system.
- Localization: The chordal process moves along the later cranio-caudal body axis from the primitive node (the cranial end of the primitive streak) further cranially and ends at the prechordal plate.
- Period: 3rd Development Week
- Procedure:
    - During gastrulation, epiblast cells migrate through the primitive node and streak between the epiblast and hypoblast to form the mesoderm.
    - Axial Mesoderm: Some of these cells grow tubular from the primitive node further cranially and form the notochord extension. In front of the notochord extension lies the prechordal mesoderm.
    - The notochordal process merges with the underlying endoderm. Additionally, at least part of the "floor" of the notochordal process dissolves, leaving only the "roof" as the so-called notochord plate. As a result, there can temporarily be a connection between the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac (neurenteric canal).
    - The chordal plate merges into the rod-shaped notochord. Additionally, a continuous endoderm layer forms again, so that the three-layered germ disc is complete once more, and the notochord now lies again between the ectoderm and endoderm.
    - During these processes, neurulation begins already.

> [!NOTE]
> The notochord regresses during embryonic development. Relics are the nucleus pulposi of the intervertebral discs!

## Neurulation

Neurulation refers to the formation of the neural tube and the neural crest, which are the precursors of the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, a number of other tissues also arise from the neural crest. Parallel to the formation of the neural tube, the surface ectoderm is formed, which later develops into the epidermis of the back.

- Definition: Formation of the neural tube and neural crests through the folding of the neural plate.
- Starting situation
    - The notochord secretes signaling molecules for the differentiation of the medial ectoderm (located directly above the notochord) into neural cells.
    - This area is referred to as the neural plate.
- Process
    - The central area of the neural plate sinks down, thus forming the neural groove.
    - The neural folds are located on both long sides of the neural groove.
    - Through the fusion of the neural folds, the neural groove develops into the neural tube.
    - Cranially and caudally, the neural tube is connected to the amniotic cavity through an opening (neuroporus).
        - Neuroporus cranialis: Closes on the 24th–25th day
        - Neuroporus caudalis: Closes on the 26th-27th day
    - Through the fusion of the neural folds from the opposite sides, the surface ectoderm is formed above the neural tube, which directly borders the amniotic cavity.
    - During the fusion of the neural folds, some cells detach from the epithelial layer and accumulate as the neural crest between the neural tube and the surface ectoderm.
- Result
    - Neural tube: Becomes the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord)
    - Neural crest: Differentiates into various cell types, including neurons, spinal ganglia, and glia of the peripheral nervous system.
    - Surface ectoderm: Becomes the epidermis of the back

> [!NOTE]
> The entire nervous system develops from the ectoderm!

> [!NOTE] Neural tube defects
> Neural tube defects or embryonic clefts are among the most common CNS malformations and occur when the embryonic neural tube fails to close completely (usually at the caudal or cranial end). Cleft formations at the caudal end are more common and are referred to as spina bifida. A distinction is made between spina bifida occulta and spina bifida aperta. In spina bifida occulta, there is only a cleft formation of the bony vertebral arch, while in spina bifida aperta, the defect additionally involves the meninges and possibly the spinal cord, which is why the clinical presentation is significantly more pronounced and can even lead to the occurrence of a paraplegic symptomatology. The clinical features of cranial clefts (cranium bifidum) are also strongly dependent on the localization and severity, with the maximum variant, anencephaly, being incompatible with life. The diagnosis of a neural tube defect is often made during pregnancy using sonography and the determination of elevated AFP and acetylcholinesterase levels in the amniotic fluid. Therapeutically, only defect coverage can be performed; the neurological prognosis is often only marginally influenceable. Preventively, adequate amounts of folic acid should be taken during pregnancy, as it is important for cell division and can help prevent the occurrence of neural tube defects.

## Morphogenesis

Morphogenesis refers to the development of body shape. This involves so-called folds (i.e., curvatures) of the embryo, transforming the flat, two-dimensional embryonic disc into a three-dimensional embryonic structure that increasingly resembles the later human body shape throughout the course of pregnancy. During these folding processes, the body cavity, body wall, and intestinal tube are formed. In addition to the development of the intestinal tube, this section also addresses the formation of the upper and lower body openings: At the cranial and caudal embryonic poles, there is a mesoderm-free region where the endoderm and ectoderm lie directly against each other and are referred to as the pharyngeal and cloacal membranes. In these two areas, the mouth and anus develop over time.

### Definition of the Body Axes

- Dorsoventral body axis: Arises from the differentiation of the embryoblast into the bilaminar germ disc.
    - Dorsal body axis: Epiblast
    - Ventral body axis: Hypoblast
- Cranio-caudal body axis: Arises from the growth of the primitive streak.
    - Cranial Pole: Primitive Node
- Right-Left Differentiation: The side-specific arrangement of the unpaired thoracic and abdominal organs is determined by the molecular asymmetry of signaling molecules in the lateral plate mesoderm.

> [!NOTE] Situs inversus
> Very rarely, there is a faulty right-left differentiation that leads to heterotaxy, i.e., a displacement of the thoracic or abdominal organs from the right side to the left side or vice versa. The clinical picture is referred to as situs inversus. It is primarily not a disease, but this peculiarity should be considered during examinations.

### Caudal Folding

- Goal: Constriction of the yolk sac
- Process: The cranial and caudal embryonal poles roll in, causing the germinal disc to curve.
- Result: Embryo has a C-shape
    - Caudal part: Coccix
    - Cranial part: Head fold

### Lateral Folding

- Goal
    - Further narrowing of the yolk sac
    - Formation of the body cavity and the gut tube
- Process
    - Outgrowth of the lateral margins of the embryonic disc ventrally
    - Approach of the ectoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm overlaying it on both sides
    - The fusion of both sides leads to the formation of the lateral and anterior body wall as well as a cavity, the secondary body cavity (intraembryonic coelom).
    - Approach of the endoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm overlaying it on both sides → Formation of the gut tube
- Result
    - Secondary body cavity (= intraembryonic coelom)
    - Drain pipe
        - Pharynx
        - Foregut
        - Midgut
        - Rectum

### Formation of Pharyngeal and Cloacal Membrane

- Goal: Formation of the later body openings
- Process
    - Pharyngeal membrane (= Buccopharyngeal membrane or Oropharyngeal membrane): Mesoderm-free area at the cranial embryonic pole
        - Sinks deep due to brain growth and the mouth pouch (= stomodeum) forms
        - The pharyngeal membrane tears shortly after folding → Formation of a connection between the oral cavity (and thus also the amniotic cavity) and the gut tube
    - Cloacal membrane: Mesoderm-free area at the caudal embryonic pole
        - Sinks down through the growth of the tailbone and the anal sinus (= proctodeum) is formed
        - Cloacal membrane tears significantly later than the pharyngeal membrane → Formation of a connection between the amniotic cavity and the urogenital or anal tract
- Result
    - The embryo is connected to the outside world through the body openings (e.g., the amniotic fluid)
## Differentiation of the Germ Disc

### Differentiation of the Mesoderm

#### Axial Mesoderm

- Location: Central part of the mesoderm
- Components: Notochord and prechordal mesoderm

#### Paraxial Mesoderm

- Location: Mesoderm adjacent to the notochord in a strand-like formation
- Components: Somites
- Procedure:
    - The paraxial mesoderm segments along the neural tube into rounded cell clusters (somites)
    - By the beginning of the fifth week, 42–44 pairs of somites initially develop in a craniocaudal direction.
    - Regression of some somite pairs, so that ultimately 35–37 somite pairs remain
    - Somites as primordial segments also determine the still recognizable segmented structure of the body (metamerism) in the fully developed organism (e.g., in the vertebrae).
    - Differentiation of the somites by signaling molecules of the notochord into different sections
- Sections of the somites
    - Sclerotome: Migration of cells medially towards the notochord and fusion of the two sclerotomes of a somite pair.
    - Dermomyotome
        - Dermatom: Migration towards the surface ectoderm
        - Myotom: Subdivision into dorsal epimer and ventrally located hypomer
            - Epimer (Embryology): Cells do not migrate but remain in place.
            - Hypomer: Cells migrate out

#### Intermediate Mesoderm

- Location: Located laterally of the paraxial mesoderm.
- Components: Urogenital fold, which contains the nephrogenic cord and the genital ridge.

#### Lateral Plate Mesoderm

- Location: Lateral of the intermediate mesoderm
- Components

    - Parietal layer (somatopleura): Layer adjacent to the ectoderm
    - Visceral layer (splanchnopleura): Layer adjacent to the endoderm

    Process
    - Already in the second week of development, small gaps form in the mesoderm where the lateral plate mesoderm will later be located.
    - Through lateral folding, the fusion of the lateral plate mesoderm on both sides occurs, and the coelomic spaces merge into a large cavity (intraembryonic coelom).
    - It represents the secondary body cavity, which later differentiates into the pericardial cavity, the pleural cavity, and the peritoneal cavity.
    - This results in the division of the lateral plate mesoderm into two layers

> [!NOTE]
> Mesenchyme ≠ Mesoderm: Mesoderm refers to one of the three germ layers that can differentiate into various tissues. In contrast, mesenchyme represents the embryonic connective tissue, which primarily arises from the mesoderm but also from other germ layers.

### Embryonic Development Plan

As an inductive plan (engl. fate map), one refers to the listing of the derivatives of a cell population, such as a germ layer. The following table provides an overview of the different types of tissues and structures that arise from the three germ layers.

## Development of the Embryo (5th-8th Week)

The fifth to eighth week of embryonic development is primarily characterized by the formation of organ systems and the further differentiation of the embryo. In the subsequent fetal period, the fetus only grows and matures; all organ systems are established by the end of the eighth week. The differentiation and precise development of individual organs (organogenesis) will not be discussed further at this point. You can find this information at the beginning of each respective organ chapter.

- Duration: Day 29–56
- Goal: Establishment of all remaining organ systems and further differentiation of the individual tissues

| **Week** | **Characteristics**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Review Questions on the Chapter Embryonic Development### Early Development (2nd Week)

Directly after implantation, the embryoblast differentiates into the so-called "bilaminar germ disc," which consists of epiblast and hypoblast. What structures arise from the epiblast?  
- The epiblast is the layer of cells of the bilaminar germ disc that borders the trophoblast. From it arise, besides the amniotic cavity, all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and thus all embryonic tissue.

### Gastrulation, Neurulation, and Morphogenesis (3rd-4th Week)

What is the notochord and where are its remnants located in the adult human?  
- The notochord (Chorda dorsalis) is a tubular structure between ectoderm and endoderm that plays an essential role in the development of the nervous system. It regresses during embryonic development except for the nuclei pulposi of the vertebral column.

The neural tube is initially open cranially and caudally after its formation. Which structure is the neural tube connected to as a result, and when do the openings close?  
- In the first embryonic weeks, the neural tube is connected to the amniotic cavity via cranial and caudal openings (neuropores). These openings close between the 24th and 27th day of development.

How does the neural crest form and what structures of nervous tissue arise from it?  
- The neural crest forms together with the neural tube and the surface ectoderm through the fusion of the two opposing neural folds. Neural crest cells are cells that detach from the epithelial layer during this fusion and become positioned between the neural tube and surface ectoderm. From them arise various cell types, including neurons, spinal ganglia, and glia of the peripheral nervous system.

From which embryonic structures do the following structures or cells originate: septum and outflow tract of the heart, intrinsic back musculature, limb skeleton, thyroid cells, glandular tissue?  
- All tissue types and structures of the body arise from the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). The septum and outflow tract of the heart develop from the neural crest, glandular tissue from the surface ectoderm; thus, both structures arise from the ectoderm. The intrinsic back musculature develops from the epimer of the myotome of the paraxial mesoderm; the limb skeleton develops from the parietal layer of the lateral plate mesoderm (the so-called somatopleura). Thyroid cells originate from the endoderm.
