# Psychotherapeutic Methods (Preclinical)
## Summary

For the treatment of mental disorders, a variety of different psychotherapies are available in addition to medication therapy. In the context of psychotherapies, healing from mental illness is pursued through conversations. Depending on the underlying problem and the goals of the respective psychotherapy, different forms can be chosen. In some cases, it is also advisable to combine different forms. The two main orientations of psychotherapy are the psychodynamically oriented and the behavioral therapy oriented methods. In addition, relaxation techniques, humanistic methods, as well as systemic therapy and couple therapy can be applied.
## Overview of Psychotherapeutic Methods

### General Definitions

- Psychology: The science of human experience and behavior
- Psychotherapy (according to Strotzka 1975): “Interaction between [...] patients and [...] therapists [...], for the purpose of treating behavioral disorders or states of suffering (mainly of psychosocial origin) with psychological means (through communication, primarily verbal, but also nonverbal), with a teachable technique, a defined goal, or based on a theory of normal or abnormal behavior.”

### Psychotherapeutic Procedures

The following lists the fundamental psychotherapeutic methods and their areas of application. The listing is kept very general at this point to better highlight the differences between the individual therapeutic methods. In fact, the areas of application are not so clearly definable and overlap in some cases. For example, work on the patient's self-image can also be done within the framework of behavioral therapy. A detailed presentation will follow in the respective chapters.

- Psychodynamic Psychotherapies: Psychodynamic Psychotherapies are applied when the structure of the personality and the self-concept need to be changed.
- Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Modification: Behavioral Therapeutic Procedures are applied to modify dysfunctional thoughts (cognitions) and behaviors.
    - Relaxation techniques as methods of behavior therapy: Relaxation techniques, such as biofeedback and autogenic training, are used to achieve physiological changes.
- Humanistic Procedures: With the help of humanistic therapeutic methods, the way mentally ill individuals cope with their disorder is to be improved.
- Systemic therapy and couples therapy: Systemic therapy and couples therapy are used when the patient's environment is considered relevant to the illness and should be included in the therapy.
## Psychodynamically Oriented Psychotherapies

The fundamentals of psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are explained in the chapter “Behavioral and Psychodynamic Models.” The following section discusses the practical application of these fundamentals. Psychodynamic models assume that relationship patterns from childhood shape the way people form later relationships (object relations theory), and the cause of mental illnesses lies in unconscious, repressed conflicts from the past. A central component of psychodynamically oriented therapies is the therapist-patient interaction, which enables the patient to re-experience and process these conflicts, thereby building new relationship experiences.

### Classical Psychoanalysis according to Freud

- Goal: Uncovering unconscious conflicts, personality change
- Duration: 2–3 times per week over several years
- Position: The patient lies on the couch, the therapist sits behind the patient and has no eye contact with him.
- Techniques of Psychoanalysis
    - Free association as a fundamental rule of psychoanalysis: The patient should articulate everything that comes to mind. This is intended to create access to the repressed unconscious.
    - Dream Interpretation: In dream interpretation, Freud sees the ideal path to the unconscious and to repressed wishes and drives.
    - Interpretation of resistance: The patient often reacts to the recognition of unconscious conflicts with resistance. The therapist's task is to recognize this resistance and determine its origin.
    - Interpretation of transference and countertransference: The patient enters the relationship with their therapist shaped by past (relationship) experiences, carrying certain expectations and feelings, which they unconsciously project onto the new relationship. In response to this transference phenomenon, the therapist also projects their feelings onto the patient (countertransference). This allows for previous relationships, feelings, and conflicts to be revisited and interpreted, enabling the patient to gain new relationship experiences.
    - Promotion of regression: Regression refers to the return to earlier developmental stages (e.g., childish behavior, denial of responsibility, tearfulness). The promotion of regression serves the purpose of recognizing and addressing early childhood conflicts.

### Depth-Psychologically Based Psychotherapy

The depth-psychologically based psychotherapy is an evolution of the classical psychoanalysis according to Freud and is now preferred in practice.

- Goal: Focusing on central conflicts and their resolution
- Duration: 1× per week over 1–1.5 years
- Sitting position: Patient and therapist sit facing each other.
- Techniques: Use of the techniques of classical psychoanalysis

> [!NOTE] Projective Test
> The so-called projective tests are based on depth psychological methods. In this case, the patient is shown ambiguous images (e.g., a splash of color) that they are to describe. The basic assumption behind these tests is that many emotions and needs only express themselves unconsciously and indirectly. Projective tests are intended to reveal these unconscious processes and thereby enable the overcoming of these defense mechanisms. Well-known examples of projective tests are the thematic apperception test (picture cards that show people in everyday situations) and the Rorschach test (picture cards with inkblots).

## Behavioral Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Modification

The following explains the practical application of learning theoretical foundations. All forms of psychotherapy that utilize the cognitive abilities of the patient to change learned behaviors that have led to a disorder are referred to as behavioral therapeutic (cognitive-behavioral) methods. Accordingly, the basic assumption of behavior therapy is that 'unhealthy' behavior is based on learning theoretical rules just like 'healthy' behavior and can be learned, but also unlearned. The learning theoretical foundations of behavior therapy are explained in the chapter “Learning, Cognition, and Development”.

- Goal: Modification of dysfunctional behaviors and cognitions
- Duration: Specific treatment goals are formulated in advance (e.g., the modification of a certain behavior), after which therapy is typically concluded.

### Techniques

#### Problem and Behavior Analysis

The behavioral therapeutic approach initially involves creating an individual behavioral analysis (e.g., using the SORKC model), which is crucial for a successful therapy.

SORKC-Model according to Kanfer

- S = Stimulus: External or internal stimulus situation, condition for the triggered behavior
    - Guiding question: In what situation does the behavior occur?
- O = Organism: Individual starting conditions, personality structures, and characteristics of the person regarding their reaction to a stimulus.
    - Guiding question: What personality type is the person?
- R = Reaction: Problem behavior
    - Guiding question: What is the reaction on the motor, emotional, cognitive, and physiological levels?
- K = Contingency: The frequency with which a consequence follows a reaction or behavior.
    - Guiding question: Does the same reaction always lead to the same consequence? Is the time interval always the same?
- C = Consequence: Reinforcement or punishment as a result of the response
    - Guiding question: What follows the reaction? This refers to both the immediate consequences in terms of operant conditioning as well as the long-term ones.

#### Confrontation Procedure (Exposure Training)

- Indication: Especially in cases of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders
- Basis: It is assumed that a learned dysfunction can also be unlearned through confrontation with the anxiety-inducing stimulus.
- Principle: The patient is confronted with the anxiety-inducing stimulus in order to achieve extinction or counter-conditioning of the learned dysfunctional behavior or to achieve habituation.
    - Terminology
        - Primacy of Affect: Before actual conscious perception occurs, an emotion (affect) towards what is currently perceived has already formed.
        - Exposition in sensu: Replication of anxiety-inducing situations; the anxiety stimulus lies in the patient's mental representation.
        - Exposition in vivo: Actual confrontation
        - Flooding (= Reizüberflutung): In Flooding, the patient is "flooded" with the fear-inducing stimulus by being exposed to the situation directly and in full extent, rather than gradually (after thorough preparation).
        - Implosion: Confrontation at the highest level in the patient's mental representation (in sensu), where the intensity can be escalated to the unrealistic in their imagination.
        - Graduated Confrontation (graduated exposure): In contrast to Flooding, the patient is gradually introduced to the anxiety-provoking situation. A hierarchy of stimuli is established, and the patient is initially confronted with objects/situations that he associates with the phobia to a limited extent.
            - Outline of a fear hierarchy
        - Systematic Desensitization: The confrontation occurs gradually and in sensu (in the mental representation), with the feeling of anxiety being antagonized by relaxation exercises (reciprocal inhibition).

#### Cognitive Methods

In cognitive approaches, the focus is not solely on behavior modification. The goal is to make the patient aware of the existence of automatic thoughts, their distortions, and their impact on behavior.

- Indication: Various psychological disorders, particularly panic attacks, depression and phobias
- Principle: Through the analysis and exchange with the therapist, an understanding of the disease connections should be achieved and dysfunctional cognitions uncovered. These can be modified through "reframing" from the patient's subjective perspective.
    - Dysfunctional Cognitions (cognitive distortions): Self-reinforcing thinking errors and irrational judgments of situations and experiences that negatively impact the psyche:
        - Overgeneralization
        - Catastrophization
        - Dichotomous Thinking (“Black-and-White Thinking”)
        - Arbitrary Conclusions
        - Incorrect prediction
        - Cognitive Triad according to Aaron T. Beck: The content of thoughts is negatively oriented towards the self, the (surrounding) world, and the future.
- Technique: After analyzing potentially negative thought patterns (e.g., "I am always to blame."), an attempt is made to gradually achieve a change in thought patterns (= cognitive restructuring, e.g., "No, the last time I was to blame, this time it's not my fault!").
    - Socratic Dialogue: In the context of the Socratic dialogue, the therapist asks the patient questions that help them realize that there are other, more realistic ways to evaluate a situation mentally.

#### Interpersonal Psychotherapy

- Indication: Mild Depression
- Principle: The patient should be assisted in managing the emotional burden caused by interpersonal problems arising from depression and in resolving interpersonal conflicts.
- Technology
    - Short therapy conducted in individual sessions (12-20 individual sessions, each lasting 45-60 minutes).
    - Focus: Interpersonal conflicts that have arisen due to the depressive illness.
    - It is based on psychoanalytic principles (transference, countertransference, regression (psychoanalytically) etc.), but uses cognitive-behavioral approaches.

#### Relaxation Techniques

- Progressive Muscle Relaxation according to Jacobson
    - Indication: Somatoform disorders, anxiety and panic disorders, sleep disorders, migraine, tension-type headache, chronic back pain
    - Principle: By consciously tensing and relaxing individual muscle groups, calming effects can be exerted on physical as well as mental tension states.
    - Technique: Patients are taught to sequentially tense individual muscle groups in a specific order, hold them, and then relax. After some time, patients are able to induce voluntary muscular relaxation through improved body awareness to counteract a state of restlessness or agitation.
- Biofeedback
    - Indication: As in progressive muscle relaxation
    - Basis: Typically, certain regulatory processes of the body (e.g., blood pressure or vascular tone) cannot be consciously perceived by humans. Through biofeedback, these processes are communicated to the patient in the form of specific signals (e.g., visually or acoustically). They can then learn to better perceive these processes (so-called increased interoceptive ability) and also to influence them willfully.
    - Principle/Example: A migraine patient is shown the pulse amplitude curve of their A. temporalis, which is attributed a significant role in the pathogenesis of migraine. In the second step, the patient learns methods to influence the pulse amplitude, for which various effective methods (such as in combination with autogenic training) can be employed. The patient can then receive direct feedback about an objectively measured change via biofeedback. The goal is to train this ability to the extent that the patient can exert influence without the aid of a device.

#### Other Forms (Excerpt)

- Assertiveness Training: Learning the ability to make demands and say "no."
- Aversion Therapy: A specific pleasant stimulus (e.g., a substance that triggers addiction) is paired with a negative stimulus (e.g., electrical shocks), so that after repeated joint application, the pleasant stimulus alone leads to the unpleasant effect, thereby causing the formerly pleasant stimulus to be avoided.
- Stimulus Control: The term Stimulus Control describes a behavioral therapy technique in which the confrontation with the stimulus is reduced by planned avoidance and modification of stimulus conditions.
- Time-Out Procedure: The Time-Out procedure is applied to children and adolescents with behavioral disorders and ADHD (which is controversial!). In cases of persistent aggressive restlessness, the child is isolated in a low-stimulus environment (Time-Out room) for a period of time. Two principles are utilized in this process: The low-stimulus environment is intended to reduce the state of restlessness. Isolation as a consequence for undesirable behavior can create a learning effect in terms of operant conditioning.
- Paradoxical Intervention according to Frankl: The paradoxical intervention is a method from psychotherapy in which the behavior deemed problematic is consciously promoted. Particularly in bipolar communication relationships (e.g., couples, supervisor-employee), such an intervention can reveal and potentially resolve a dependency issue. It is also successfully used in cases of sleep onset disturbances.
- Operant reinforcement programs
    - Reinforcers in the sense of operant conditioning are regularly used in the context of behavioral therapeutic methods.
    - Special operant reinforcement programs, known as token programs, are primarily used in child and adolescent psychiatry.
        - Reward for exhibiting the desired behavior through a token
- Modeling programs
    - People learn behaviors by observing them in other people (Observational Learning)
    - The patient learns the desired behavior by observing the behavior of their therapist or other patients, for example, in the context of role-playing.
## Humanistic Methods and Systemic Therapy

### Humanistic Procedures

Indication: The humanistic therapeutic approaches are rather general methods intended to improve the way individuals with mental illnesses cope with their disorders. They are typically used supportively in cases of mild to moderate mental disorders (in combination with pharmacotherapy and/or other psychotherapies).

#### Client-Centered Therapy According to Rogers

- Principle: Conversational therapy characterized by active listening aimed at promoting the self-actualization tendency
- Technology
    - The therapist must ensure the following three aspects
        - Appreciation
        - Empathy
        - Authenticity/Congruence
    - Behaviors and experiences that serve self-actualization are being pursued more intensively.

### Systemic Therapy

The systemic therapy views a person's familial or social environment as a system in which all elements influence each other. In particular, the communication and interaction between members of a system can be causally related to the emergence and maintenance of symptoms.

- Technology (example)
    - Reframing: A negative event/behavior is reinterpreted in a positive light.
## Review Questions for the Chapter on Psychotherapeutic Methods (Preclinical)
### Overview of psychotherapeutic methods

What is psychology actually?
- Psychology is the science of human experience and behavior.
What is meant by psychotherapy? Provide a rough overview of the different psychotherapeutic methods!
- Psychotherapy is the collective term for different non-medication treatment methods of psychological and psychosomatic illnesses. The most important methods are psychodynamic psychotherapies (e.g., the classical psychoanalysis according to Sigmund Freud) as well as behavioral therapy (e.g., exposure training for anxiety disorders); in addition, further psychotherapeutic directions such as humanistic methods and systemic therapies have emerged.
### Psychodynamically oriented Psychotherapies

Where do, according to psychodynamic models, the causes of mental illnesses lie?
- Psychodynamic models assume that the cause of psychological disorders lies in unconscious, repressed conflicts from the past.
Describe the object relations theory of the psychodynamic personality model!
- The object relations theory of the psychodynamic personality model states that the relationship patterns to the attachment figures (called "objects") from childhood (e.g., to the mother) shape the manner of later relationship formation and personality development.
Which are the five techniques of classical psychoanalysis according to Freud?
- The five techniques of classical psychoanalysis according to Freud are free association, dream interpretation, interpretation of resistance, interpretation of transference and countertransference, and promotion of regression.
Which psychoanalytic technique involves the patient saying everything that comes to mind?
- In the psychoanalytic technique of free association, the patient says everything that comes to mind. Free association serves to uncover unconscious, repressed conflicts.
What is meant by transference and countertransference in psychoanalysis?
- In psychoanalysis, it is assumed that patients unconsciously reactivate (relationship) experiences from the past onto the relationship with the therapist (= transference). In response to this transference phenomenon, the therapist also projects their feelings onto the patient (= countertransference). The interpretation of transference and countertransference is an essential part of psychoanalysis.
What distinguishes depth-psychologically founded psychotherapy from classical psychoanalysis according to Freud?
- Both depth-psychologically founded psychotherapy and classical psychoanalysis according to Freud assume that unconscious, repressed conflicts of the past can lead to psychological illnesses. The goal of classical psychoanalysis according to Freud is a holistic change of personality. The patient lies on the couch without eye contact to the therapist; the therapy is often conducted (2–3 times per week) over a long period (several years). Depth-psychologically founded psychotherapy is the (now preferred) further development of classical psychoanalysis according to Freud. Patient and therapist meet less frequently (only once a week) over a shorter period (1–1.5 years) and sit opposite each other. The goal of depth-psychologically founded psychotherapy is the resolution of central conflicts.
To what type of tests does the Rorschach test belong?
- The Rorschach test belongs to projective tests: in this depth-psychological procedure, ambiguous images (in the case of the Rorschach test: image plates with inkblots) are shown to the patient, who is asked to describe them. The test is based on the assumption that many emotions and needs are only expressed unconsciously and that describing the images helps to uncover unconscious processes and overcome defense mechanisms.
### Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Modification

What is the SORKC model used for?
- The SORKC model is used to create an individual problem and behavior analysis within the framework of behavioral therapy. Learned behaviors and cognitions that have led to a disorder and maintain it are identified and can then be specifically changed in therapy.
What terms are hidden behind the individual letters of the SORKC model?
- The letters of the SORKC model stand for the following terms: S stands for stimulus, which triggers the problem behavior. O stands for organism – this means the individual starting conditions and personality structures of the patient. R stands for reaction and thus represents the problem behavior. K stands for contingency – this describes how regularly a consequence occurs following the problem behavior. C stands for the consequence of the performed behavior; it can be either a reinforcement or a punishment.
In which mental disorders is exposure therapy particularly useful?
- Exposure training is especially useful in anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders. It is assumed that a learned, dysfunctional behavior can be unlearned through therapeutic confrontation with the anxiety-inducing stimulus.
What is the difference between Flooding and graduated exposure?
- Flooding and graduated exposure are both confrontation procedures in which the patient is exposed to the anxiety-inducing stimulus. In flooding (stimulus flooding), the confrontation occurs fully at once; in graduated exposure, however, it occurs stepwise and in a weakened form – thus achieving systematic desensitization. For example, a patient suffering from fear of heights would have to immediately climb the highest platform of a tower during flooding, whereas in graduated exposure, they would only climb a few steps higher each time.
What are dysfunctional cognitions?
- Dysfunctional cognitions are distorted, irrational, self-reinforcing thinking errors and judgments of situations and experiences. These include overgeneralization ("Nothing ever works for me"), catastrophizing ("My headache must be from a brain tumor – I will die!"), dichotomous thinking ("A person is either good or bad"), arbitrary conclusions ("My cat was run over because I didn't take good enough care of it"), and the cognitive triad according to Aaron T. Beck.
What does cognitive behavioral therapy aim at?
- Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to show the patient their dysfunctional thinking patterns and then change them step by step. It is particularly effective in depressive disorders.
What does the cognitive triad refer to according to Aaron T. Beck?
- The cognitive triad according to Aaron T. Beck refers to a cognitive distortion of reality that often occurs in depression. The patient's thought content is negatively oriented toward the self, the (surrounding) world, and the future. This leads, for example, to the assumption: "I am worthless, everyone finds me terrible, and the future will be even worse."
What is the purpose of the time-out procedure?
- The time-out procedure is controversially used in children and adolescents with conduct disorders and ADHD. In non-interruptible aggressive states of unrest, the child is isolated for some time in a low-stimulus environment (time-out room) – which is supposed to reduce the unrest and produce a learning effect in terms of operant conditioning.
What does the term “stimulus control” describe?
- The term "stimulus control" describes a behavioral therapy technique in which confrontation with a stimulus is deliberately avoided. For example, alcoholic beverages are removed from the daily environment so they cannot tempt drinking.
What is the purpose of biofeedback?
- Biofeedback serves to make unconscious bodily regulation processes (e.g., blood pressure) consciously perceptible to the patient using (e.g., visual or acoustic) feedback signals. The goal is that the patient learns to perceive and voluntarily influence these processes even without feedback via technical devices.
### Humanistic Methods and Systemic Therapy

What are the three basic characteristics of client-centered therapy according to Rogers?
- The three basic characteristics of client-centered talk therapy according to Rogers are appreciation, empathy, and authenticity. By the therapist adopting these basic characteristics toward the patient, they encourage the patient to seek the solution to the problem within themselves.
