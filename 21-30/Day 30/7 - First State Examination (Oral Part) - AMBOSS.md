# First State Examination (Oral Part)
## Summary

The written Physikum is just one hurdle on the way to the clinic. The greater concern for many students is the oral Physikum. It is a completely different examination situation than the written exam. You are not sitting anonymously in a large room with many other students bent over a pile of questions and marking your answers (with the knowledge that you have already marked a number of past questions in the last few weeks). You cannot postpone a question for later if you initially cannot answer it. Even guessing or relying on good old gut feelings is not necessarily a good strategy in the oral exam.

And yet: We all made it! And you can too! Unlike in the written exam, you can influence the course of the oral exam. If you prepare well and manage your excitement during the exam to some extent, the oral Physikum can become an interesting professional conversation on equal footing. Remember that no examiner is fundamentally interested in failing a student. We want to give you a few useful tips for preparing and for the course of the oral Physikum. Possible exam questions have been compiled for you in the chapter “Example Questions from the Oral Physikum”.

We are keeping our fingers crossed for you!
## What can I expect?

If you are asked about detailed knowledge in the multiple-choice format during the written exam, the oral exam mainly focuses on the presentation of this acquired knowledge, but at a more general level. The examiners want to see that you have developed a basic understanding of the subjects being tested and can explain complex processes and relationships.

### Procedure

The procedure for the examination varies depending on the university or teaching hospital and, of course, also depends on the respective examiners.

- You will be tested in the three subjects of anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry.
- The exam takes place on one day and lasts about one hour per candidate, so depending on the number of candidates, it will be 1 to 4 hours.
- At least one histological preparation must be recognized under the microscope.
- It is often expected that you can recognize or demonstrate certain structures in macroscopic specimens (usually individual organs).
- Depending on the examiner, simple chemical structural formulas (e.g. glucose or amino acids) must be recorded.
## How do I best prepare?

Between the written and the oral exam, there are one to several weeks. Whether your oral exam takes place before or after the written exam depends on your university and the state examination office. It can also happen that you have to prepare for both exams simultaneously. Ideally, there should be enough time between the two exams. But even if that’s not the case: No panic!

You can easily customize the AMBOSS study plan for the written Physikum by stretching it out (starting earlier), shortening it, or pausing it if it conflicts with your preparation time for the oral exam. And keep in mind that the material you study for one of the two exams will also help you with the other exam. So you are not studying anything for nothing.

How do you best proceed now that you have received the invitation to the oral Physikum (with the announcement of the date, examination location, and examiners)?

### Get to know your examiners

- Obtain the examination protocols from your examiners.
- Go to the preliminary discussion with your examiner.
- Search the internet and the libraries
- If it is still possible to arrange it in the short time (or perhaps it has already happened): Try to see your examiners live in a lecture.

### Find yourself a study group

- Best suited for this: Your fellow exam candidates
    - You often find your fellow exam takers through the telephone game principle.
    - If you have no success through this route, the student council often offers assistance in the search, usually through forums, but sometimes for a small fee.
- Learn specifically the material from the old protocols and the research focuses of the examiners.
    - For the oral exam, you should not learn any IMPP details, but rather develop a fundamental understanding of a topic.
- Talk to each other as much as possible and quiz each other.
    - Summarizes all learned content loudly and freely.
    - Ask each other questions, help and correct each other with the answers.
        - Possible exam questions have been compiled for you in this chapter: Sample questions from the oral medical examination
    - Practice presenting your arguments confidently and keeping a cool head in stressful situations.
- Draw more complex processes.
    - It can also happen that you will be asked to create such a sketch during the exam.
- Practice recognizing the microscopic preparations and the electron microscopy images.
    - Describe to each other what you see
    - List the most important characteristics for identifying the preparation or the electron microscopic image.
    - Also creates sketches here
- Go to the dissection room and take another look at the "favorite organs" of your anatomy examiner there.
    - Describe to each other what you see
    - Check each other.
    - Here, the functions of the respective structures are reiterated again.
## Tips for the Examination Interview

Oral exams are generally not just a simple question-and-answer game, but rather an examination conversation, meaning that you can partially influence the direction in which the discussion develops. Make it clear in advance: Every examiner knows enough to fail you if they want to. No matter how much you study, you won't be able to cover every detail. Therefore, it is more important to conduct a confident subject discussion than to recite 100 individual details from memory.

Most examiners want to assess their students well, as their performance ultimately reflects on them and the teaching at the university. They are therefore willing to follow the candidates in their reasoning or to give them hints.

Here are a few tips on how you can influence the exam conversation in your favor:

- Don't be surprised if very open introductory questions are asked: Such questions give you the opportunity to freely share what you have learned.
- Try to present your answers with confidence, but without any grandstanding.
- Watch the examiners during your answer.
- If there are topics that you are very knowledgeable about and that interest you, feel free to showcase that.
- If you do not understand a question, ask for clarification and do not try to guess what the examiner might want to hear.
- If you notice any gaps in knowledge or learning during your response, try to keep the topic more general or gently steer it in another direction.
- Feel free to interrupt and correct yourself if you notice a mistake in your response.
- If you need to think about a question, feel free to say so and take a few seconds to sort out your thoughts.
- If you do not know the answer to a question even after some consideration, you can earn extra points by thinking aloud and trying to derive the answer from the foundational knowledge you possess.
