# Uterine tube
## Summary

The paired fallopian tubes (tubae uterinae) connect the ovaries to the uterus. They are located intraperitoneally in the small pelvis and are about 10 cm long. The blood supply to the fallopian tubes comes from branches of the ovarian artery and the uterine artery. After ovulation, the egg cells are captured by finger-like projections of the fallopian tubes, the so-called fimbriae, and transported towards the uterus with the help of specialized ciliated epithelium. If the egg cell is fertilized, the first divisions of the embryonic cells already take place in the fallopian tube. By the way, you can also find a histo-trainer episode on the fallopian tubes and ovaries in the section on the microscopic anatomy of the fallopian tubes.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function: Reception, fertilization site, and transport of the mature egg cell
- Location: Pairing, intraperitoneal in the small pelvis
- Shape: Tubular with a funnel-shaped, fringed extension at the abdominal end
- Size: Approximately 10–15 cm long

### Structure

- Sections
    1. Infundibulum of the uterine tube: Funnel-shaped, with fringe-like extensions towards the ovary (= fimbrial funnel)
    2. Ampulla of the uterine tube: Expansion that curves around the ovary.
    3. Isthmus of the uterine tube: Narrow, elongated part of the fallopian tube that opens into the uterus.
    4. Uterine part: Intramural portion located in the uterus with uterine ostium of the tube (section with the narrowest lumen)

### Topography

- Bands
    - Mesosalpinx: The portion of the broad ligament of the uterus adjacent to the fallopian tube
    - Lig. suspensorium ovarii: Flexible suspension on the pelvic wall
- Location
    - Intraperitoneal in the cranial part of the ligamentum latum uteri in the small pelvis
    - The fallopian tube is connected to the uterus via its uterine part.
    - Curves around the ovary
- Location relationships
    - Fimbriae and ampullae of the uterine tube: They are adjacent to the ovary, especially during ovulation.
    - In their course between ovary and uterus
        - Bladder: Can be in contact with the isthmus of the fallopian tube in anteversion-anteroflexion of the uterus.
        - Intestinal segments: Alternating adjacent sections of the small and large intestine
        - Appendix: May be located on the right side in close proximity.

> [!NOTE] Right-sided lower abdominal pain in women
> In the case of right-sided lower abdominal pain, due to close anatomical relationships, salpingitis (inflammation of the fallopian tube) and adnexitis (inflammation of the fallopian tube and ovary) must also always be ruled out alongside appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix).

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

|Vessel Supply|   |
|---|---|
|Arterial|- A. ovarian from abdominal aorta<br>- R. tubarius of A. uterine from internal iliac artery|
|Venous|- Ovarian vein<br>- Uterine venous plexus in uterine veins|
|Innervation|   |
|Sympathetic|- Ovarian plexus<br>- Inferior hypogastric plexus|
|Parasympathetic|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |
|Lymph nodes|- Left lumbar lymph nodes (left)<br>- Intermediate lumbar lymph nodes (right)|

### Microscopic Anatomy

The fallopian tube consists of four wall layers. The ciliated epithelium of the tunica mucosa works together with the musculature of the tunica muscularis to transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus.

|Wall Layer|Components|
|---|---|
|Tunica mucosa|- Labyrinthine branched, high mucosal folds with epithelial lining<br>- Simple columnar (= high prismatic) epithelium<br>    - Two different cell types, specialized for oocyte transport<br>        1. Glandular cells: Secretion formation for transport and nourishment of the oocyte<br>        2. Ciliated cells: Ciliated epithelial cells, movement towards the uterus<br>    - Cyclical changes of the epithelium<br>        - Follicular phase and ovulation: Ciliated cell lining and height of the epithelium in the ampulla tubae uterinae↑↑<br>        - Secretory phase: Glandular cell lining and secretion↑↑|
|Muscularis layer|- Three layers of longitudinal and circular muscle components<br>- Increases towards the uterus|
|Subserosal tissue|- Loose connective tissue with vessels|
|Tunica serosa|- Visceral Peritoneum|
## Function

1. Capture of the egg from the ovary using the fimbriae.
    - Mobility of the fallopian tube and ovary: The fallopian tube and ovary actively move towards each other to ensure the transport of the egg.
    - Goal: The fimbriae of the fallopian tube are adjacent to the ovulating part of the ovary.
    - Involved structures
        - Smooth muscle cells in the suspensory ligament of the ovary and the broad ligament of the uterus
        - Muscular layer of the fallopian tube
        - Fimbriae funnel
2. Site of fertilization
3. Transport of the (fertilized) egg to the uterus

> [!NOTE] Ectopic pregnancy
> An ectopic pregnancy, which implants outside the uterus, is called an ectopic pregnancy. It most commonly occurs in the fallopian tubes, for example, when there are constrictions in the fallopian tube pathway that impede the passage of the eggs. Possible causes include previous ascending infections (e.g., due to chlamydia) or surgeries of the fallopian tubes. Patients often only present late with abdominal pain in combination with a missed menstrual period.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Uterine Tube
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Name the individual sections of the uterine tube! Where is its narrowest point located?  
- The uterine tube consists of the funnel-shaped infundibulum ("fimbrial funnel"), the ampulla, the isthmus that opens into the uterus, and the uterine part, which is already located within the uterine wall. The uterine part also represents the section with the narrowest lumen.

### Microscopic Anatomy

How is the mucous membrane of the uterine tube structured?  
- The tunica mucosa of the uterine tube consists of a single-layered, tall columnar epithelium containing two different cell types: glandular cells and ciliated cells. The latter support the transport of the ovum by beating their cilia towards the uterus. The mucous membrane also forms high, labyrinthine branched folds.  
How is the muscle layer of the uterine tube structured?  
- The tunica muscularis of the uterine tube is a three-layered muscle with longitudinal and circular muscle components.
