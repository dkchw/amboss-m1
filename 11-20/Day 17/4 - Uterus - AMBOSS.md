# Uterus
## Summary

The uterus (Uterus) is one of the female sexual organs and is responsible for nourishing the unborn child during pregnancy. It is approximately the size of a fist and pear-shaped, but can grow to many times its size during pregnancy. The mucous membrane is also adapted to the function of the uterus: it is built up during the course of the menstrual cycle to potentially house a fertilized egg. If this does not occur, the mucous membrane is shed and menstruation occurs. During childbirth, the muscles of the uterus play a special role: they contract rhythmically ("contractions") and thus push the baby through the birth canal. Furthermore, the ligaments of the uterus are also designed to adapt to its rapid growth.
## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function: Menstruation, implantation of the fertilized egg, housing of the fetus during pregnancy, expulsion for childbirth
- Location: Central in the small basin
- Shape: Pear-shaped
- Size: Approximately 10 cm long, approximately 5 cm wide, approximately 3 cm thick
- Weight: Approx. 50–120 g

### Structure

The uterus is divided into the uterine body and the cervix. Inside lies the uterine cavity, where the child can develop during pregnancy.

|Shares|Description|
|---|---|
|Corpus uteri|- Body of the uterus (upper 2⁄3 of the uterus) with:<br>    - Fundus uteri: Roof of the uterus with the openings of the two fallopian tubes<br>    - Cavitas uteri (uterine cavity): Cavity of the uterus with cycle-dependent mucosal lining|
|Isthmus uteri|- 0.5–1 cm long uterine constriction at the transition to the cervix uteri|
|Cervix uteri|- Cervix (lower ⅓ of the uterus) with:<br>    - Supravaginal portio of the cervix: Intrauterine section of the cervix with the internal cervical os<br>    - Canal of the cervix uteri (cervical canal)<br>        - 2–3 cm long<br>        - Between the internal and external cervical os<br>        - Distal uterine ostium opens at the vaginal portio into the vagina<br>    - Vaginal portio of the cervix<br>        - Intravaginal section of the cervix with the uterine ostium (external cervical os)<br>        - Macroscopic appearance depends on whether the woman has given birth<br>            - Nullipara: Round with a central round uterine ostium<br>            - Primipara/Multipara: Transversely oval with anterior and posterior lips and transversely oriented uterine ostium|
### Topography

The uterus is centrally located in the small pelvis and is fixed on both sides by three supporting ligaments. The position of the uterus is additionally described by the terms flexion, version, and position.

#### Stopping Device

The parametrium is a connective tissue, flexible attachment of the uterus in the small pelvis that surrounds the cervix uteri and anchors it ventrally, dorsally, and laterally. Included in the parametrium are the uterine ligaments, which allow the uterus to adapt to the filling state of the bladder and rectum or to the requirements during pregnancy. The cranial roof of the parametrium is formed by the lig. teres uteri. Distally, the uterus is supported not only by the subperitoneal holding apparatus but also by the pelvic floor muscles (see: pelvic floor).

|Uterus Support Device|Description|Course|Contained Structures|
|---|---|---|---|
|Broad ligament of the uterus (mesometrium)|- Extensive support ligament of the uterus<br>- Lies intraperitoneally|- Lateral uterine wall → Lateral pelvic wall|- Uterine artery and vein<br>- Ureter (caudal)|
|Lig. teres uteri (Lig. rotundum, round ligament of the uterus)|- Connective tissue support ligament that holds the uterus in anteversion-anteflexion<br>- Remnant of the embryonic gubernaculum ovarii<br>- Clinically significant as it can serve as a guiding structure for tumor cells|- Tube angle → Inguinal canal → Labia majora|—|
|Subperitoneal Support Apparatus of the Uterus|- Fan-shaped connective tissue fibers running from the cervix uteri to the pelvic wall, bladder, and rectum<br>- Main component: Lig. cardinale<br>- Other components: Lig. vesicouterinum, Lig. rectouterinum, Lig. sacrouterinum|- Horizontal course between the supravaginal portion of the cervix and the lateral pelvic wall|- A. and V. uterina<br>- Ureter<br>- Lymphatic vessels and nerves to the cervix and uterus|

> [!NOTE] Uterine Prolapse
> If the holding apparatus of the uterus and the pelvic floor muscles loosen, for example after multiple vaginal or complicated births, it can lead to a prolapse of the uterus (uterine prolapse). The severity can vary greatly: from a slight descent into the vaginal canal during strain (such as when using the abdominal press or coughing) to a permanent total prolapse with the entire uterus descending in front of the vaginal entrance. If the patient desires treatment, support can be achieved conservatively, for example, by inserting pessaries. If family planning is complete, a surgical removal of the uterus can also be performed.

#### Peritoneal Relationships

The uterus is partially located intraperitoneally and subperitoneally in the female pelvis. The broad ligament of the uterus divides the female pelvis into an anterior and a posterior peritoneal compartment.

- Vesicouterine excavation: The anterior compartment of the female pelvic cavity located between the bladder and uterus.
- Rectouterine excavation (Douglas space): The posterior compartment of the small pelvis located between the rectum and the uterus, and also the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity in a standing woman.

> [!NOTE] Douglas Space
> Free fluid in the intraperitoneal abdominal cavity (e.g., in inflammatory processes or bleeding) accumulates in the Douglas pouch in standing women and can be clinically detected here, for example, through sonography or computed tomography.

#### Situation

Three terms illustrate the position of the uterus in the small pelvis: Flexio, Versio, and Positio. Versio and Flexio describe the vertical position with bending in two planes, while Positio refers to the horizontal position.

- Flexio: Bending of the body of the uterus in relation to the cervix of the uterus
    - Anteflexion: In general, the body of the uterus is tilted forward (angle approximately 100°)
    - Retroflexion: The body of the uterus is tilted backwards, a normal variant.
- Version: Angulation of the cervix uteri in relation to the vaginal canal
    - Anteversion: In general, the cervix is also tilted forward (angle approximately 90°, which increases when the bladder is filled)
    - Retroversion: Tilted cervix uteri, normal variant
- Position: Position of the uterus relative to the midline in the small pelvis at the level of an imagined line connecting the two ischial spines.
    - Center-positioned: Central location, occurs in most women
    - Dextropositioned: Shifted to the right
    - Sinistropositioned: Shifted to the left

> [!NOTE]
> Normally, the uterus is in anteversion-anteflexion in the small pelvis of the woman. In 10% of women, there is a deviation from the norm!

> [!NOTE] Retroflexion of the uterus
> The retroflexion of the uterus is usually congenital and rarely causes discomfort. However, a retroflexed uterus can be an obstacle to conception, as the uptake of sperm cells is more difficult. Also, when performing surgical procedures on the uterus, the position of the uterus must always be determined beforehand to avoid injuries. In the case of a uterus tilted backward, if there are complaints, a return to the normal flexion can be achieved through a surgical shortening of the ligaments teres uteri on both sides.

#### Location Relationships

- Ventral: Urinary Bladder
- Dorsal: Rectum
- Lateral: Broad ligament of the uterus, Uterine tubes, Ovaries, Parametrium, Ureter
- Cranial: Varying bowel loops
- Distal: Vagina

### Layers of the Uterine Wall

The uterus consists of three layers: endometrium, myometrium, and perimetrium. The endometrium refers to the cyclically varying mucous membrane that is surrounded by the thick muscle layer of the myometrium. Partially, the uterus is covered by peritoneum; these portions are called perimetrium. The cyclic changes of the mucous membrane are discussed under "menstrual cycle."

> [!NOTE] Endometriosis
> In endometriosis, endometrial tissue also appears outside the uterine cavity. At least 15% of women are affected by this condition. The displaced tissue also participates in the menstrual cycle. This leads to bleeding that often cannot drain (for example, so-called "chocolate cysts" in the ovary) and causes cyclical pain.

### Histological Structure of the Cervix

The epithelium of the cervical canal and the vaginal portion differs from the endometrium of the uterine cavity.

#### Epithelium of the Cervical Canal

- Characteristics: The mucous membrane of the cervix has numerous folds (Plicae palmatae) and crypts.
- Epithelium: Columnar, mucus-producing cells
- Secret of the cervical epithelial cells: Alkaline (increases sperm motility)
    - Formation of the "mucus plug": Viscous mucus; protects the uterus from germs
    - At ovulation, the mucus is thinned and "stretchable"

#### Epithelium of the vaginal portion of the cervix

- Epithelium: Stratified, non-keratinized squamous epithelium
- Characteristics: Changes depending on the menstrual cycle and the age of the woman.
    - For cyclical changes see: Cyclical mucosal changes of the vagina and vaginal cervix portio
    - Before puberty/after menopause: Surface completely covered with multilayered, non-keratinized squamous epithelium.
    - From sexual maturity: Ectopy (mucosa of the cervical canal shifts to the surface of the portio)
        - This makes the boundary between the mucous membrane and the stratified, non-keratinized squamous epithelium visible during a vaginal examination.
        - Over time, the less resilient mucosa transforms into the more robust squamous epithelium; this metaplastic area between the original and current transition of the two epithelial types is referred to as the transformation or transition zone.
        - The transformation zone shifts endocervically with age; during this process, the squamous epithelium can grow over ectopic mucous glands, causing their ducts to become obstructed and leading to the formation of secretory inclusions (so-called "Nabothian follicles").

> [!NOTE] Cervical cancer and prevention
> In the transition zone of the vaginal portion of the cervix, malignant cervical cancer can develop from both the squamous epithelium of the portio and the columnar epithelium of the cervix. It is the second most common sex-specific cancer in women after breast cancer. An infection with the human papillomavirus is considered the main risk factor for the development of cancer in the cervix. There is now a vaccination available against the particularly risky types of the papillomavirus. For the early detection of cervical cancer, annual Pap smears are performed on women aged between 20 and 34 years (from age 35, only every 3 years along with an HPV test [co-test]). The abbreviation "Pap" stands for the staining of the collected cells according to Papanicolaou, which helps to assess altered cervical cells effectively.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Uterus
### Macroscopic Anatomy

In which part of the uterus do the fallopian tubes open?  
- The fallopian tubes (Tubae uterinae) open into the fundus of the uterus (the roof of the uterus) with the ostium uterinum tubae.

Through which structures is the uterus anchored in the pelvic cavity?  
- The uterine ligaments (Lig. latum uteri, Lig. teres uteri) form a connective tissue, flexible fixation of the uterus in the pelvis. Distally, the uterus is supported by the subperitoneal suspension apparatus (especially Lig. cardinale) and the pelvic floor musculature.

Which band can malignant tumors of the uterus metastasize to the inguinal lymph nodes? Describe its course!  
- The Lig. teres uteri begins at the transition of the fallopian tube into the uterus (tubal angle) and runs laterally and ventrally. There it enters the inguinal canal and thus reaches the labia majora. This course is clinically significant because tumors can metastasize accordingly from the tubal angle into the inguinal lymph nodes.

How is the uterus normally positioned in the small pelvis?  
- The position of the uterus in the pelvis is described by three indicators: flexio, versio, and positio. Flexio denotes the bending of the corpus uteri forward or backward in relation to the cervix uteri. Versio designates the inclination of the cervix uteri in relation to the vaginal canal. Positio indicates the location of the uterus relative to the median plane in the pelvis; physiologically, the portio vaginalis lies at the level of the interspinous line in the pelvis center and is not shifted to the left or right. In 90% of women, the uterus lies in anteversio-anteflexio in the small pelvis.

What clinical significance can a retroflexion of the uterus have? What measures can be taken in that case?  
- The usually congenital retroflexion of the uterus rarely causes complaints but can make conception more difficult. A restoration to the normal flexio can possibly be achieved by surgical shortening of both ligaments teres uteri.

How is the arterial supply of the uterus provided?  
- The arterial supply of the uterus is provided by the uterine artery (A. uterina) from the internal iliac artery (A. iliaca interna): on the one hand by its highly twisted helicine branches (which reach the uterus via the broad ligament), on the other hand by its two anastomosing end branches (R. tubarius and R. ovaricus).

### Microscopic Anatomy

Describe the structure and function of the endometrium! Which structure triggers menstruation?  
- The mucosa of the endometrium consists of surface epithelium with a lamina propria, tubular glands (Glandulae uterinae), and many spiral arteries (tortuous arterioles within the lamina propria). The endometrium is divided into the stratum basale, which represents the cycle-independent regenerative layer, and the stratum functionale, which changes depending on the cycle and is shed during menstruation. The contraction of the spiral arteries in the desquamation phase leads to hypoxia and shedding of the built-up mucosa (menstrual bleeding).

What is the purpose of the secretion from the uterine glands?  
- The tubular uterine glands produce an alkaline secretion to protect against infections, which also facilitates implantation and transport of the ovum.

Which part of the uterus has the so-called plicae palmatae (mucosal folds)?  
- The mucosa of the cervix possesses numerous folds (plicae palmatae) and crypts.
