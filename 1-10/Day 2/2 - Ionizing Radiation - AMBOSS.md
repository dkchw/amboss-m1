# Ionizing Radiation
## Summary

Ionizing radiation is high-energy radiation, which includes not only the types of radiation from classical radioactivity (alpha, beta, and gamma radiation) but also X-rays. This describes what the different types of radiation consist of and the physical properties that can be used to describe them.

For medicine, the interactions that occur between ionizing radiation and matter are of particular importance. Here, the attenuation and penetration depth of radiation in tissue, as well as the consequences for living matter, are of interest – that is, which radiation dose is harmless or fulfills the therapeutic purpose one aims for.
## Basic Concepts of Radioactivity

Since most types of ionizing radiation belong to the so-called "radioactive radiation types," some basic properties of radioactivity will be introduced here.

- Radioactive radiation: Radiation that is emitted from an atomic nucleus
    - Particle radiation: Fragments from the atomic nucleus (alpha radiation) or elementary particles (beta radiation) are emitted.
    - Photon radiation (electromagnetic waves): Photons (electromagnetic radiation, gamma radiation) are emitted from the atomic nucleus.
- Radioactive elements
    - Light elements: Atomic nuclei (nuclides) with an unstable ratio of neutrons to protons, such as in carbon-14.
    - Heavy elements: nuclei with more than 83 protons (i.e., atomic number ≥84) are unstable
- Nuclear decay: Transformation of an unstable nucleus into daughter nuclei, e.g. 226Ra → 222Rn + 4He
- Decay series: A chain reaction that occurs when nuclear decay initially leads to unstable daughter nuclei and ends with the formation of a stable nucleus.

> Particle radiation can be completely shielded by appropriate protective measures, while electromagnetic radiation can only be attenuated!

> [!note]
> The terms radioactive radiation and ionizing radiation are not synonymous: Radioactive radiation refers to radiation emitted from the nucleus of an atom; ionizing radiation encompasses all types of radiation whose energy is high enough to ionize matter regardless of its origin!

## Types of Radiation

As ionizing radiation, all types of radiation are referred to whose energy is high enough to remove electrons from an atom. These can be classified as follows:

### Alpha Radiation

- Characteristics: Particle radiation from alpha particles, i.e., helium nuclei, each consisting of two protons and two neutrons.
    - Origin: Is emitted by radioactive nuclides (= alpha emitters) (= alpha decay)
    - Reaction: AZX → (A-4)(Z-2)E2- + 42He2+
- Energy: Compared to beta or gamma radiation, there is approximately a 20-fold higher harmful effect on the tissue.
- Effect: Directly ionizing
- Range: Approx. 5 μm in water (≈ tissue)
- Protective measures: Sheet of paper sufficient
- Medical application (example): radionuclide therapy for bone metastases

### Beta Radiation

- Characteristics: Particle radiation of two types
    - β+-radiation: Consists of positrons
        - Origin: A proton in the nucleus transforms into a neutron, a positron (and a neutrino); the positron (and the neutrino) are emitted as radiation.
        - Reaction β+: AZX → A(Z-1)E + e++ neutrino
    - β--Radiation: Consists of electrons
        - Origin: A neutron transforms into a proton, an electron (and an antineutrino); the electron (and the antineutrino) are emitted as radiation.
        - Reaction β-: AZX → A(Z+1)E + e- + antineutrino
- Energy: A constant energy is not always emitted. During beta decay, no monochromatic radiation is produced (i.e., with particles of a defined energy); rather, an energy spectrum is generated that depends on the decaying element.
- Effect: Directly ionizing
- Range: Approx. 5mm in water (≈ tissue)
- Protective measures: E.g. several mm thick aluminum sheet
- Medical application (example): Primarily for therapeutic purposes (e.g. 131Iod for radioiodine therapy)

### Gamma Radiation

- Characteristics: Electromagnetic Wave
    - Typical occurrence: Energy is released in the form of photons when an atomic nucleus transitions from an excited state to the ground state. (Radiation is emitted from the atomic nucleus.)
    - Reactions: [AZX]* →AZX + Photon
- Energy: Electromagnetic, ionizing radiation with higher energy than X-rays.
- Effect: Indirectly ionizing
- Protective measures: Materials with high atomic numbers, e.g. lead
- Medical application (example): Primarily for diagnostic purposes (e.g. 123Iod or 99mTc for scintigraphy)

### X-ray Radiation

- Characteristics: Electromagnetic Wave
    - Typical formation: Ionizing radiation produced by the impact of highly accelerated electrons on a metallic anode (radiation is emitted from the electron shell)
        - Characteristic X-ray radiation: Characteristic line spectrum for the respective anode material.
        - Bremsstrahlung: Continuous braking radiation spectrum
            - Electrons from the X-ray cathode are deflected and slowed down near the (positively charged) atomic nuclei of the anode material. In the process, they emit a portion of their kinetic energy as electromagnetic bremsstrahlung. A continuous spectrum is produced with many energies and a maximum in the low energy range.
            - It holds: The greater the voltage of the anode, the
                - Greater the maximum energy and radiation power (energy per time) of the X-ray photons
                    - The maximum photon energy of bremsstrahlung is attained when the entire kinetic energy of an electron is used for photon production and can be calculated using EPhoton = e×U.
                        - EPhoton = Energy of the Photon, e = Elementary charge = 1.6 ×10^-19C, U = Anode voltage
                - Greater the cutoff frequency of the X-rays
                - Smaller the limiting wavelength of X-ray radiation
    - Reactions: [AZX]* →AZX + Photon
- Energy
    - Corresponds to the kinetic energy of the radiation particles; the unit is electronvolt (eV)
    - Depending on the anode material and the applied anode voltage, either "soft" (<100 keV) or "hard" radiation (≥100 keV) is generated.
- Effect: Indirectly ionizing
- Half-value thickness: The tissues of the body weaken X-rays to differing degrees due to their varying densities, resulting in different exposures on an X-ray film.
- Protective measures: Materials with high atomic numbers, e.g. lead
- Medical application (example): Diagnostic purposes (e.g. CT = computed tomography or X-ray)

> [!note]
> Radioactive radiation refers to ionizing radiation that is emitted from an atomic nucleus; this includes alpha, beta, and gamma radiation!

> [!note] X-ray diagnostics
> X-rays that strike a tissue are absorbed to varying degrees depending on the properties of the tissue (thickness, density, atomic number) and the radiation itself (soft or hard). The remaining intensity after passing through the tissue is sufficient to expose an X-ray film. This is utilized diagnostically to visualize various structures.
> Soft X-rays (with an energy <100 keV) have a low penetration depth and are used, among other things, for the diagnosis of tissues with a high proportion of atoms with high atomic numbers, such as bones, but also in mammography to make fine density differences (e.g. microcalcifications or tumors) visible. Hard X-rays (with an energy >100 keV) have a high penetration depth and are used, for example, in conventional chest X-rays.

> [!note] Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
> In PET, we are dealing with a non-invasive procedure in nuclear medicine that allows for functional statements about a disease process. The patient is administered metabolism-relevant molecules that have been previously labeled with β+-emitters, also known as positron emitters (e.g., 11C, 13N, 15O). These emit positrons that shortly thereafter annihilate with an electron from the surrounding tissue, emitting two γ-quanta (= high-energy photons) in opposite directions. These γ-quanta are then recorded. Their position allows for conclusions to be drawn about the distribution of the labeled molecules in the body. In clinical practice, PET is primarily used in cardiology (heart PET), for example, to assess the severity of coronary heart disease, in oncology (oncology PET) for the examination of tumors (e.g., thyroid carcinomas, pancreatic carcinomas, brain tumors, or malignant melanomas), and in neurology (neuro PET), for example, to investigate certain neurotransmitter systems (including differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or early detection of Huntington's chorea or primary dementia).

## Properties of Radiation

If one wants to characterize radiation more precisely, one must know not only the type of radiation but also how strong the radiation is: This can be inferred, for example, from the radiation activity, which provides information on how quickly a radiation source decays. Conversely, the number of nuclei can also indicate how many radioactive nuclei a radiation source still has. Both quantities exhibit an exponential trend. However, the half-life is usually used to characterize radiation and the radiation source.

- Radioactive activity: Number of nuclei that decay in a specific amount of time
    - Formula: A(t) = N(t) × λ = A0×e-λt
        - Unit: Bq (Becquerel, 1 Bq = 1/s)
        - t = Considered time; A(t) = Activity at the considered time, N(t) = Number of cores at time t, λ = Decay constant, e = Euler's number ≈ 2.718
- Number of cores: Number of atomic nuclei of a radiation source participating in radioactive decay.
    - Formula: N(t) = N0 × e-λt
        - t = time at which it is considered; N(t) = number of nuclei at the time of consideration, N0 = number of nuclei before the decay starts, λ = decay constant, e = Euler's number ≈ 2.718
- Half-life: The time after which half of all originally present radioactive nuclei have decayed.
    - Formula: t1/n = ln(n) / λ => t1/2 = ln2 / λ
        - Unit: s (second)
        - t1/2 = half-life, λ = decay constant
- Mean lifetime: Describes the average time required for a certain radioactive nucleus to decay.
    - Formula: τ = 1 / λ
        - Unit: s (second)
        - τ = average lifetime, λ = decay constant

> [!note]
> The radiation energy of elementary particles is very small; therefore, it is usually expressed in the unit keV: 1 eV = 1 V × elementary charge = 1 × 1.6 × 10^-19 VAs = 1.6 × 10^-19 J.

### Example Calculation Half-Life

A radioactive element has a decay constant of 0.0005/s. What is the half-life of this element?

- Sought: Half-life t½ (the time after which half of the existing nuclei have decayed)
- Given: Decay constant λ
    - The half-life can be calculated with the formula t½ = ln2 / λ
    - ln2 corresponds to a numerical value of approximately 0.7
    - t½ = ln2 / 0.0005/s = 0.7 / 0.0005/s = 1386 s (= 23 min)
    - The half-life of the element is approximately 23 minutes.

### Example Calculation of Radioactive Activity

A radioactive element has a decay constant of 0.0078/s. How many nuclei of the element are still present after 30 minutes if the initial amount is 10^15 nuclei?

- Sought: The core number after 30 minutes (N30)
- Given: The initial quantity N0, the decay time t, the decay constant λ
    - For radioactive decay, the equation is N(t) = N0 ×e-λt
    - For the present case, it then holds that N(30) = 1015 × e-0.0078/s × 1800 s = 1015 × e-14 = 1015 × 0.0000008 = 8 × 108
    - After 30 minutes, there are still 8 × 10^8 atomic nuclei present.

## Interaction of Ionizing Radiation and Matter

When radiation interacts with matter, it is attenuated as a result. The exact nature of the interaction mainly depends on whether it is particle radiation (as in alpha and beta radiation) or electromagnetic waves (as in gamma and X-ray radiation). The following statements apply particularly to electromagnetic radiation.

### Law of Attenuation and Half-Thickness

The further the path of radiation through the matter, the stronger the attenuation. Furthermore, the attenuation of radiation depends on the type of matter and the frequency of the radiation. The decrease in radiation is described by the so-called attenuation law, but the attenuation is often also expressed in the form of the half-value thickness.

- Law of attenuation for radiation: When radiation hits matter, there are absorption and scattering effects that lead to an exponential attenuation of the radiation.
    - Weakening of radiation intensity
        - Formula: I = I0 × e-μd
            - Unit: W/sr (sr = "Steradian", a measure of solid angle 1 sr = 1 m2/m2)
            - I = Radiation intensity after interaction with matter, I0 = Radiation intensity before interaction with matter, μ = Attenuation coefficient, d = Layer thickness
            - The attenuation coefficient is proportional to the atomic number of the material being penetrated raised to the fourth power (μ∼Z4), meaning that absorption increases with the atomic charge = the atomic number of an element.
    - Weakening of radiation energy: For the energy of radioactive radiation, the inverse square law applies.
        - Formula: E ∼ 1/r²
            - E = radiant energy, r = distance
- Half-value thickness: The distance that radiation travels in a material until the radiation intensity is reduced by half.
    - Formula: dH = ln2 / μ
        - Unit: m
        - dH = half-value thickness, μ = attenuation coefficient

> [!note]
> Radiation from uncharged particles (e.g. gamma radiation) is attenuated less strongly by matter than radiation from charged particles (alpha radiation)!

> [!note]
> The radiation energy E decreases inversely proportional to the square of the distance r from the radiation source (E ∼ 1/r2). For example, if you stand 2 m away instead of just 1 m from an X-ray machine, the radiation energy is only a quarter (1/22 = 1/4); at a distance of 10 m, the radiation energy is only one-hundredth (1/102 = 1/100)!

#### Sample Invoice

The radiation of a laser decreases in muscle tissue according to an exponential attenuation law. The absorption coefficient of the tissue is 750/cm. After what distance through the tissue is approximately 1/10th of the original intensity still present?

- Sought: layer thickness (radiation path through the tissue) d
- Given: Absorption coefficient of the radiation μ,
    - The attenuation of radiation can be calculated using the formula I = I0×e-μd
    - It is to be considered that I = 1/10 × I0 should hold true
    - => 1/10 = e-750 × d ⇔ ln(1/10) = -750 × d ⇔ d = ln(1/10) / -750 = 0.003 cm = 0.03 mm = 30 μm
    - The radiation intensity decreases to 1/10 after it has traveled 30 μm through the tissue.

### Special Interaction of Gamma Rays

- Attenuation of the energy of the photon (γ-quant) when passing through matter due to
    - Photoelectric effect
        - Photon energy is completely absorbed by the atomic electron shell, causing an electron to be ejected from it.
        - In particular, for photons in the low energy range of a few keV
    - Compton Effect
        - Collision of photon and electron with the transfer of part of the photon energy to the electron, where the photon is scattered with reduced energy.
        - Especially with photons in the medium energy range of a few 100 keV to a few MeV
    - Pair formation
        - Conversion of the photon into an electron-positron pair in the atomic nucleus, which self-annihilates by producing 2 highly energetic photons.
        - Especially for photons in the energy range of at least 1.022 MeV, becoming more likely with increasing energy.

## Radiation Dose

- Dose: Amount of radiation that affects an object
- Dosimetry: Method for determining the dose of radiation
- Energy dose: Emitted radiation energy related to mass
    - Formula: D = E/m
        - Unit: Gy (Gray) = J/kg
        - D = Energy dose, E = absorbed energy, m = irradiated mass

- Equivalent dose: The multiplication of energy dose and a radiation type-dependent quality factor allows for the comparison of radiation energies of different types of radiation.
    - Formula: H = D × q
        - Unit: Sv (Sievert) = J/kg
        - H = Equivalent dose, D = Energy dose, q = Quality factor
        - The quality factor q is 1 for beta and gamma radiation, 10 for neutrons, and 20 for alpha radiation.
- Dose rate: Radiation energy emitted per unit mass and time
    - Formula: D' = D/t
        - Unit: Sv/s = Gy/s = J/(kg×s)
        - D' = Dose rate, D = Energy dose, t = Time unit

> [!note] Radiation exposure
> Every person is exposed to natural radioactive radiation, which is about 2 mSv/year at ground level. In medicine, much higher radiation doses are used: The radiation exposure caused by a chest X-ray taken in 2 views corresponds to about 0.1 mSv, which is already equivalent to the radiation exposure of an eight-hour flight at over 10,000 meters altitude; a CT scan of the chest even results in a radiation exposure of about 5 mSv. Doses over 250 mSv are considered cell-damaging – this damaging effect is deliberately used to combat cancer cells, in radiation therapy with doses of 20,000–80,000 mGy, and in radioiodine therapy even with doses of 100,000–400,000 mGy. To understand what this means, it is worth noting that per Gy (= 1000 mGy) radiation dose, about 5000 DNA damages/cell occur! See also: DNA damage.

> [!note]
> Since the energy amounts of individual radiant nuclei are so tiny, the unit "electron-volt" (eV) is often used here. The conversion to the "normal" energy unit joule (J) is done with the following formula: 1 eV = 1 V × elementary charge = 1 × 1.6 × 10^-19 VAs = 1.6 × 10^-19 J!

### Example Calculation

A person is exposed to a continuous, low-level radioactive radiation from gamma rays. Each decay event corresponds to a radiation energy of 10^-12 J. What is the energy dose absorbed by this person in one month (30 days), if the person weighs about 80 kg and is exposed to approximately 10,000 decay events per day?

- Sought: Energy Dose D
- Given: mass m, time t, number of decay events, radiation energy (E)
    - The number of radioactive decays that humans are exposed to is 10,000 × 30 = 300,000
    - For each decay, an energy of 10-12 J is released; the total radiation energy that a person is exposed to is therefore 300,000 × 10-12 = 3 × 10-7 J.
    - The energy dose (D) is now calculated using the formula D = E/m = 3 × 10-7J/80 kg = 0.00000000375 Gy ≈ 3.8 nGy
    - The energy dose of radioactive radiation to which a person is exposed per month is approximately 3.8 nGy.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Ionizing Radiation
### Types of Radiation
What does alpha radiation consist of, and how do the radioactive nuclides change due to the radiation?
- Alpha radiation is classified as so-called particle radiation. It consists of helium nuclei (i.e., particles with two protons and two neutrons). The proton number of a nuclide therefore decreases by 2 through the radiation process, and the nucleon number decreases by 4.

What does beta radiation consist of, and how do the radioactive nuclides change due to the radiation?
- Beta radiation belongs to the so-called particle radiations and consists either of positrons (β+ radiation) or electrons (β− radiation). β+ radiation occurs when a proton in the nucleus converts into a neutron; thus, the proton number of the radiating nuclide decreases by 1, but its nucleon number remains the same. β− radiation occurs when a neutron in the nucleus converts into a proton; thus, the proton number of the radiating nuclide increases by 1, but its nucleon number remains the same.

What is gamma radiation and how does it originate?
- Gamma radiation is electromagnetic radiation. Energy in the form of photons is released by the transition of an atomic nucleus from an excited state to the ground state (the emitted radiation therefore originates from the atomic nucleus). The number of nucleons and protons remains constant.

Describe X-rays and their origin or generation!
- X-rays are classified as electromagnetic radiation and are generated in a so-called X-ray cathode. For this, the cathode material is heated until electrons are released, which are then accelerated towards a metallic anode in an electric field. The nuclides are not changed during the radiation process. In contrast to gamma radiation, X-rays originate from the electron shell and are longer-wavelength and less energetic comparatively.

What type of radiation is used in scintigraphy?
- Gamma radiation is used in scintigraphy.

What type of radiation is used in computed tomography (CT)?
- X-rays are used in computed tomography.

Which radiation sources are used in positron emission tomography (PET)?
- In positron emission tomography (PET), metabolically relevant molecules previously labeled with β+ emitters, also called positron emitters, are administered as the radiation source. Some important nuclides are, for example, 11C, 13N, and 15O.

### Properties of Radiation

How is the strength of radiation indicated?
- The strength of radiation can be indicated using the so-called radiation activity. This is the number of nuclei that decay within a certain time and emit radiation in the process. The unit of radiation activity is the becquerel (Bq = 1/s).

What are the half-life and the mean lifetime of a radioactive nucleus, and how are they related?
- The half-life is the time after which half of all radioactive nuclei in a sample have decayed. It is calculated as the quotient of ln2 and the decay constant of the radiation; the unit of the half-life is the second. The mean lifetime is also given in seconds; however, it describes the average time required for a specific radioactive nucleus to decay. Since it corresponds to the reciprocal of the decay constant, it can be converted into the half-life by multiplying it by ln2.

What is the unit electronvolt (eV) and what is it used for?
- The electronvolt is a unit of energy used because the energy amounts of individual radiating nuclei are so tiny that it would be cumbersome to calculate with the “normal” energy unit joule (J). 1 eV is approximately 1.6 × 10^-19 J.

### Interaction of Ionizing Radiation and Matter

What happens to ionizing radiation when it hits matter?
- Ionizing radiation is attenuated when it hits matter because absorption and scattering effects occur, among others. The attenuation occurs exponentially, i.e., proportional to the square of the distance traveled (∼1 / r²) and can be calculated with the formula I = I0 × e^(-μd) (I = intensity of the attenuated radiation, I0 = initial intensity of the radiation, μ = attenuation coefficient, d = distance traveled).

What is the half-value thickness?
- The half-value thickness is the distance that radiation travels in a material until the radiation intensity has halved.

Which types of radiation are particularly strongly/less attenuated?
- Radiation from uncharged particles (e.g., gamma radiation) is attenuated less strongly by matter than radiation from charged particles (alpha radiation).

What is meant by the law of the square of the distance?
- The law of the square of the distance states that the radiation energy E of a point radiation source is inversely proportional to the square of the distance r: E ∼ 1 / r². If you move three times farther away from a radiation source, the radiation energy does not decrease to one-third, but already to 1/3² = 1/9. This relationship is of great importance in radiation protection and in the therapeutic application of radiation in radiotherapy.

### Radiation Dose

What is meant by the energy dose and equivalent dose of radiation? How are they calculated and what units are used for this?
- The energy dose is the amount of energy delivered by ionizing radiation to an object. It is calculated as the quotient of absorbed energy and irradiated mass and is given in the unit gray (Gy = J/kg). The equivalent dose is the weighted energy dose, which makes it possible to compare different types of radiation with each other. The weighting is done by multiplying the energy dose with a quality factor specific to each radiation type. The unit of the equivalent dose is the sievert (Sv = J/kg).
