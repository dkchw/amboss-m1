# Fundamentals of Embryology
## Summary

As the science of prenatal development, embryology provides the foundation for understanding many anatomical relationships and physiological processes in the human organism. While general embryology focuses more on the basic developmental steps of essential components such as the germ disc and prenatal supply structures, special embryology describes organ development. Following the first eight weeks of the (pre-)embryonic period is the fetal period, which lasts until birth. Already during the embryonic stage, so-called primordial germ cells develop and migrate into the gonadal structures. The further development into a fertilizable egg cell and a fertilizable sperm cell occurs at different times for females and males, specifically through meiotic division - this process is referred to as the germline. Both in this context and later during the course of pregnancy, malformations of the unborn child can occur (e.g., due to harmful toxins). These are classified based on the timing of the damage into gameto-, blasto-, embryo-, and fetopathies and have varying degrees of severity for those affected. Clinically, stem cells have also become increasingly important. In addition to adult stem cells, which can only replace renewable tissue, embryonic stem cells can take on nearly any tissue differentiation and are therefore interesting for testing new therapies.
## Overview

- Definition: Embryology is the study of prenatal development.
- Classification
    - By focus
        - General Embryology: Development of the germ cells and the embryo during the first weeks of pregnancy
        - Special Embryology: Development of the Organs
    - After the passage of time (development weeks)
        - Preembryonic period (1st week of development): From the fertilization of the egg until implantation in the uterus
        - Embryonal period (2nd-8th week of development): Formation of germ layers, development of the human shape, and establishment of organs
        - Fetal period (9th week of development to birth): Growth and differentiation of the tissues and organs established during the embryonic period.

> [!NOTE]
> The formation of all organ systems occurs during the embryonic period, whereas organ maturation takes place during the fetal period.

## The Carnegie Stadiums

The staging of the embryo can be based on its age, size, or morphological properties. Each embryo sequentially develops the same structures during its development; however, each embryo takes a different amount of time to do so. Therefore, it is challenging to compare embryos of the same age. For this reason, O'Rahilly and Müller focused on morphological properties and divided the first eight weeks of embryonic development (56 days) into 23 Carnegie stages that each embryo goes through in succession. Since the internal and external morphological changes are no longer as pronounced after the 8th week, this classification is not applicable during the fetal period.

Example: Carnegie Stadium 14

- Main features
    - Arm buds shaped like paddles
    - Lenticular and olfactory foveae recognizable
    - Eye cups available.
- Length: 5.0-7.0mm
- Age: 31-32 days
## The Development of Germ Cells (Gametogenesis)

Very early in embryonic development, primordial germ cells are formed, which migrate into the gonadal structures during the course of development. Through a maturation division, the mature gametes (egg cells or sperm) develop sex-specifically from the primordial germ cells (oogonia or spermatogonia).

### The Formation of the Germ Cells

- Time: 4th embryonic week
- Location: Wall of the yolk sac
- Process: Diploid germ cells develop and migrate into the gonadal ridge of the urogenital fold by means of amoeboid movement.
    - From the female primordial germ cells, oogonia develop.
    - From the male primordial germ cells, spermatogonia develop.

### The Germ Line

- Definition: Sex-specific development of primordial germ cells into mature gametes (= gametes)
- Procedure: Meiosis of the primordial germ cell (see below)
    - Oogenesis (=development of the egg cell): An oocyte is formed with 2-3 polar bodies.
    - Spermatogenesis (=Development of sperm): Four functional sperm are produced.

> [!NOTE]
> From a primordial germ cell, four functional sperm cells or one oocyte with three polar bodies are formed!

## Meiosis

### Overview

In both sexes, a maturation division (meiosis) occurs as part of further germ cell development.

- Definition: Meiosis of germ cells, in which one germ cell divides to form four daughter cells with recombined genetic material.
- Goal: Random distribution of the diploid set of chromosomes to haploid daughter cells to ensure the genetic diversity of the offspring.
- Preparation: In order for meiosis to occur, the DNA is first replicated during the S phase of interphase.
- Process: Meiosis occurs in two stages.
    - Meiosis I (=Reduction division)
        - Reduction of the chromosome set: The diploid chromosome set is divided by separating the homologous chromosomes from each other.
        - Recombination of genetic material: Originally maternal and paternal chromosomes are randomly distributed to daughter cells → This results in genetic diversity
    - Meiosis II (=Equational division): The two chromatids of each chromosome of the haploid chromosome set are separated → Essentially corresponds to the phases of mitosis
- Balance
    - Cell count: 1 mother cell → 4 daughter cells
    - Chromosome set: Diploid mother cell (2n) → Haploid daughter cells (1n)
    - DNA content: 4 chromatids of the mother cell (4C) → 1 chromatid per daughter cell (1C)
- Gender-specific characteristics
    - Oogenesis: The development of all female egg cells occurs before birth, but both Meiosis I and Meiosis II are interrupted by a resting phase.
        - 1. Resting phase (Dictyotene): Interruption of prophase I in diplotene and remaining in the resting phase until shortly before the onset of ovulation.
        - 2. Resting phase: Interruption of meiosis II during metaphase II and remaining in the resting phase until fertilization.
    - Spermatogenesis: With the onset of puberty, the continuous production of sperm begins in the testis. In this process, spermatogonia mature into viable sperm through four developmental stages.

> [!NOTE] Numerical chromosomal aberrations
> In cases of numerical chromosome aberrations, the number of chromosomes deviates from the norm. The cause is a non-disjunction during meiosis, meaning the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate (meiosis I) or the failure of sister chromatids of a chromosome to separate (meiosis II). The resulting aneuploidy manifests in cells with one extra chromosome (trisomy) and in cells with one fewer chromosome (monosomy). Clinically, this can lead to the death of the embryo or to various syndromes such as trisomy 21 or Klinefelter syndrome. For more information, see also chromosome aberrations.

> [!NOTE]
> For the pairing of chromosomes during prophase, the homologous sections of the chromosomes must lie exactly opposite each other. However, the two sex chromosomes (X and Y chromosome) differ significantly in their structure. Only a small homologous sequence (the so-called pseudoautosomal region) at the distal end of the short arm allows for their pairing and crossing-over!

## Stem Cells

Stem cells have recently come into focus due to advancements in research. Their ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types makes them one of the most significant cell types in the organism. In addition to embryonic stem cells, there are adult stem cells, which are already more differentiated.

- Definition: Stem cells are cells that, on one hand, produce copies of themselves (and thus renew themselves), and on the other hand, can differentiate into specialized cells.
- Cell division
    - Symmetric division: Self-reproduction → Both resulting cells have stem cell properties
    - Asymmetric division: Differentiation → A cell with stem cell properties and a precursor cell with differentiated properties is formed.
- Properties
    - Omnipotence (syn. Totipotence): The ability of a cell to differentiate into any cell type.
    - Pluripotency: The ability of a cell to differentiate into various, but not all, cell types.
- Classification
    - Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
        - Origin: Derived from the inner cell mass in the blastocyst stage
        - Degree of differentiation: Pluripotent cells that can only develop into embryonic body cells, but not into trophoblast cells.
    - Adult stem cells
        - Origin: They are located in differentiated tissues with high renewal potential (e.g., in the bone marrow)
        - Degree of differentiation: Pluripotent cells that provide replenishment for regenerable tissue
    - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS)
        - Origin / Degree of differentiation: Differentiated body cells that have been artificially modified in their genome to be reverted to pluripotent cells and are used, among other things, in research.

> [!NOTE] Stem cell therapy
> Stem cell research is often critically discussed because it could be very beneficial for studying developmental processes. In addition, adult hematopoietic stem cells are already being used to treat leukemias or other hematological malignancies. Typically, high-dose chemotherapy is first administered to kill the malignant cells. Subsequently, a transplantation of one's own (autologous) or donor (allogeneic) stem cells can take place to regenerate the blood and immune system. A particular case is the therapy with stem cells from one's own umbilical cord blood (Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant).

## Developmental Disorders and Malformations (Teratology)

Malformations are the result of embryonic or fetal intrauterine developmental disorders. They can vary greatly in severity and may be noticeable at birth or may only become apparent later in development. Additionally, the changes can occur at macroscopic, microscopic, or molecular biological levels and thus manifest in very different ways. Malformations occur in approximately 2-3% of newborns. The causes of these malformations are very diverse; both exogenous and endogenous factors can facilitate their occurrence. In more than half of the cases, the cause of congenital malformations is unknown. In 20-25% of cases, there is likely a multifactorial genesis. Depending on the time of mutation occurrence, different forms of disease are distinguished:

- Gametopathies: They arise preconceptionally during the formation or through damage to the parental germ cells (gametes).
- Blastopathies: Disorders that occur until the 14th day of development.
- Embryopathies: Disorders that occur between the 3rd and 8th week of development.
- Fetopathies: Disorders that occur after the 8th week of development.

> [!NOTE]
> The earlier the disturbance in child development, the more complex the malformations!

### Gametopathies

Already at the preconception stage during the formation or damage of the parental germ cells (gametes), serious DNA errors can occur. The resulting disease patterns are usually severe and are referred to as gametopathy. Gametopathies can be further divided into two different types of DNA damage: chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations.

#### Chromosome Aberrations

Chromosomal aberrations are disorders that affect the number or structure of chromosomes. They are the cause of congenital malformations in humans in 6-7% of cases.

- Numerical chromosomal aberrations
    - They mainly arise from non-disjunction during mitosis or meiosis and lead to aneuploidy.
    - No separation of the chromatid pairs, resulting in one cell with one excess chromosome (trisomy) and one cell with one fewer chromosome (monosomy)
    - For more information and clinical examples, see chromosomal aberrations.
- Structural chromosomal aberrations: Primarily due to chromosome breaks. Particularly common is the loss of chromosome segments (deletion). The table is intended to provide an overview of typical gametopaties caused by chromosomal damage.

|Defect|Disease|Symptoms|
|---|---|---|
|Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5|Cri-du-chat syndrome (cat cry syndrome)|- Cat-like crying in infancy<br>- Intellectual disability<br>- Simian line<br>- Facial anomalies<br>- Skeletal anomalies<br>- Short stature|
|Microdeletion of the long arm of chromosome 22|DiGeorge syndrome|- Variable phenotype<br>- The typical symptoms can be summarized under the acronym CATCH-22 syndrome:<br>    - Cardiac Anomalies=Heart defects<br>    - Anomalous Face=Facial dysmorphia<br>    - Thymic aplasia/hypoplasia<br>    - Cleft palate=Cleft palate<br>    - Hypocalcemia=Hypocalcemia<br>    - Affected chromosome=22|
|Microdeletion of the long arm of chromosome 15 in combination with genomic imprinting|Deletion of the maternal gene copy → Angelman syndrome|- Delayed motor and cognitive development in infancy and early childhood<br>- Intellectual disability<br>- Ataxic gait disturbance<br>- Characteristic happiness with frequent laughing<br>- In more than 80% of cases, pronounced epilepsy|
|Deletion of the paternal gene copy → Prader-Willi syndrome |- Muscle hypotonia<br>- Increased appetite and obesity<br>- Short stature<br>- Hypoplasia of the genitalia<br>- Facial dysmorphia|

#### Gene mutations

In a gene mutation, there is damage to individual gene loci with a change in the nucleotide sequence of the DNA. It can occur spontaneously or due to exogenous influences. Gene mutations account for 7-8% of cases of congenital malformations.

- Mode of inheritance
    - Autosomal-dominant/recessive
    - Gonosomal (X-Chromosomal) dominant/recessive

|Inheritance Mode|Disease|Symptoms|
|---|---|---|
|Autosomal-dominant|Achondroplasia|- Disproportionate dwarfism with:<br>    - Short arms and legs<br>    - Relatively large head and trunk|
|Marfan Syndrome|- Connective tissue disorder with<br>    - Skeletal changes: Arachnodactyly, hyperlaxity of joints, tall stature, etc.<br>    - Cardiovascular changes: Mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysm/dissection<br>    - Ocular symptoms: Myopia|
|Autosomal-recessive|Cystic fibrosis|- Thick secret of the exocrine glands causes:<br>    - Failure to thrive<br>    - Chronic digestive insufficiency<br>    - Chronic lung diseases<br>    - Electrolyte loss due to highly salty sweat|
|Phenylketonuria|- The missing conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine causes:<br>    - Accumulation of phenylalanine in the CNS<br>        - Intellectual disability<br>        - Frequent epileptic seizures|
|X-chromosomal dominant|Rett syndrome|- Most common cause of intellectual disability in girls<br>    - Initially normal development<br>    - Developmental stagnation with loss of previously acquired abilities at 6-8 months of age|
|X-chromosomal recessive|Hemophilia A and B|- Coagulation factor deficiency with:<br>    - Bleeding tendency<br>    - Prolonged bleeding time|

### Blastopathies

Diseases that occur due to disturbances up to the 14th day of development are referred to as blastopathies.

- Malformations: Very complex malformations with duplications, absence of body parts
    - High risk of miscarriage

#### Conjoined Twins (Siamese Twins, Pagi)

Doppel malformations arise from incomplete separation during the formation of identical twins from day 14 after fertilization and pose a significant medical challenge. The adhesion can be superficial, affecting only the skin or body wall, or it can also involve shared organ structures. Organ malformations are not uncommon. Depending on the degree of adhesion, separation is possible today; however, the operation is very complex and usually associated with high risks for the patients. Double malformations can be classified based on their manifestation or according to their site of adhesion.

- Classification by manifestation
    - Complete symmetric double malformation: Both fetuses are fully developed and connected at certain parts of their bodies.
    - Incomplete symmetric double malformation: Only the upper or lower half of the fetus's body is duplicated.
    - Asymmetric parasitic twin malformation: Only a rudimentary remnant of a twin structure. The more developed child carries the less developed child on or in its body.
- Classification by adhesion site
    - Craniopagus: Fused at the head
    - Thorakopagus: Fused at the chest.
    - Pygopagus: Fused at the sacrum

### Embryopathies

Embryopathies are diseases caused by disorders that occur between the 3rd and 8th week of development.

- Malformations: Complex malformations of individual organs
- Cause
    - Medication-toxic, drugs, alcohol → Embryofetopathies caused by toxins
    - Infectious: Infectious embryofetopathies and congenital infections can occur in the case of seronegative mothers or through contact with the pathogen during birth.
        - Significant pathogens (see also embryofetal pathologies caused by infectious agents)
            - S for Syphilis
            - T for Toxoplasmosis
            - O for Others: Listeriosis, Varicella, Parvovirus B-19
            - R for Rubella
            - C for Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
            - H for Herpes simplex

> [!NOTE]
> "STORCH"

> [!NOTE]
> Primary infection of the mother during pregnancy → Maternal IgM antibodies are not placentally transferable (and IgG antibodies have not yet been formed) → Transplacental infection of the child! Generally, the earlier the infection occurs during pregnancy, the more severe the consequences!

|Pathogen|Malformations|
|---|---|
|Syphilis|- Different symptoms depending on the stage|
|Toxoplasmosis|- 1. First trimester: frequent miscarriage<br>- 2. and 3. Trimester: retinochoroiditis, hydrocephalus, intracerebral calcifications, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice|
|Others (Listeriosis, Varicella, Parvovirus B-19)|- variable|
|Rubella|- Rubella embryopathy:<br>    - frequent abortion<br>    - Gregg triad: inner ear deafness, cataract, and various heart defects<br>- Rubella fetopathy:<br>    - hepatitis, splenomegaly<br>    - hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia<br>    - symptoms usually resolve|
|Cytomegalovirus|- Diverse symptoms<br>    - CNS: Periventricular calcifications, hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhages, microcephaly<br>    - Eye: Chorioretinitis<br>    - Jaundice and acholic stools, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia<br>- Late effects<br>    - Hearing impairments, vision impairments<br>    - Psychomotor retardation, learning difficulties (intellectual deficits)<br>    - Dental defects|
|Herpes simplex|- Transplacental transmission (rare): Hypotrophy, microcephaly, and -ophthalmia, intracerebral calcifications<br>- Intrapartum and postpartum transmission (more common):<br>    - Local infection with typical herpes blisters, herpes simplex keratitis<br>    - Disseminated systemic infection, possibly with CNS involvement (resembles a septic clinical picture)|

> [!NOTE] Pharmacotherapy in Pregnancy
> The medicinal treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding presents a special challenge for the treating physician. Many medications can cross the placenta or pass into breast milk and can therefore harm the child.

### Fetopathies

Fetopathies occur when the disturbance takes place after the 8th week of development. They are usually less severe than disturbances in earlier weeks.

- Malformations: The organ development is mostly complete except for the CNS development. The damage is therefore particularly severe in the CNS. The other organs are less severely affected.
- Causes
    - Infectious: s.o.
    - Antibodies: Rhesus incompatibility → Neonatal hemolytic disease
    - Metabolism: Gestational diabetes

> [!NOTE] Neonatal Hemolytic Disease
> Morbus haemolyticus neonatorum is an intensified hemolysis in the fetus or newborn, which is triggered in more than 95% of cases by a Rh incompatibility. If a Rh-negative mother forms so-called anti-D antibodies against the blood cells of a Rh-positive child, severe cases can lead to hydrops fetalis even in utero. Since the formation of antibodies occurs only towards the end of pregnancy, the first child is usually not affected. Only in a second pregnancy with a Rh-positive child do symptoms occur. Postnatally, affected infants show hemolysis-related anemia, which can lead to neonatal jaundice due to an increased level of unconjugated bilirubin. In rare cases, the administration of red blood cell concentrates is necessary in cases of significantly reduced Hb levels. Since Rh incompatibility can lead to a life-threatening hydrops fetalis with fatal consequences, anti-D prophylaxis must be conducted for Rh-negative mothers.

> [!NOTE] Gestational diabetes
> Gestational diabetes refers to a glucose tolerance disorder that first occurs or is diagnosed during pregnancy. While there is an increased (!) insulin sensitivity with a tendency toward hypoglycemia in the first trimester, a hormonally induced increasing insulin resistance develops in the second and third trimesters, leading to an elevated risk of diabetes. The consequences of gestational diabetes for the mother include an increased risk of gestosis, urinary tract infections, excessive amniotic fluid, and a higher risk of preterm birth. Affected children may develop diabetic fetopathy with macrosomia and postnatal regulation disorders. The risk of malformations is also increased. The most severe complication is caudal regression, which can result in aplasia or hypoplasia of the coccyx and lumbar spine. Due to the serious complications for both mother and child associated with undetected gestational diabetes, a mild oral glucose tolerance test should be performed on every pregnant woman between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. In most cases, this form of diabetes mellitus disappears after childbirth.

> [!NOTE] Critical phases of organ development
> Since the various parts, tissues, and organs of the human body develop at different times during the prenatal period, there is a specific phase for each structure in which development is particularly susceptible to disruption. While a disturbance in the first two weeks of development is more likely to lead to abortion, disturbances in the subsequent weeks particularly affect the organs that are forming or maturing during that time. Therefore, a disturbance in the third week of development primarily affects the CNS and heart, for example.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Basics of Embryology
### Meiosis

When does DNA replication take place?
- DNA replication occurs before the first meiotic division during the synthesis phase (S-phase). A diploid mother cell (2n = double chromosome set = 46 chromosomes) with two-chromatid chromosomes (2n4C) is formed.
Why is meiosis I also called reduction division?
- In meiosis I, firstly, the division (= reduction) of the diploid chromosome set occurs by separating the homologous chromosomes from each other, and secondly, the recombination of genetic material takes place to create genetic diversity (daughter cells are not identical to mother cells). This results in two haploid daughter cells with a single chromosome set and diploid chromatids (1n2C).
The prophase I of meiosis I is divided into further stages. Name them along with a brief explanation of the processes taking place!
- Prophase I is divided into five stages, during which cell number, chromosome set, and DNA remain unchanged (2n4C). It begins with condensation and the chromosomes becoming visible in leptotene, followed by the pairing of homologous chromosomes in zygotene and the crossing-over of chromatids in pachytene. Thereafter, the synaptonemal complex dissolves in diplotene and the chromosomes are again present individually. In diakinesis, the nuclear membrane finally dissolves and the cell can enter metaphase I. It should be noted in this context that in female individuals meiosis I stops at diplotene (the first resting phase = dictyotene), and the oocyte only completes meiosis I shortly before ovulation begins.
In which phase of meiosis I does the division of the mother cell occur into two daughter cells?
- The division of the mother cell into two haploid daughter cells (1n2C) occurs in the telophase of meiosis I.
How does the crossing-over of sex chromosomes (gonosomes) differ from that of autosomal chromosomes?
- For crossing-over, homologous sections of chromosomes align exactly opposite each other. However, the X and Y chromosomes differ in their structure except for a small homologous sequence at the distal end of the short arm (= pseudoautosomal region), so pairing and crossing-over can only occur there. Autosomes, on the other hand, can exchange larger blocks of DNA sequences among each other.
What causes numerical chromosomal aberrations?
- If in meiosis I the homologous chromosomes fail to separate, or in meiosis II the sister chromatids fail to separate, this is called non-disjunction. The result is aneuploidy with either one chromosome too few (monosomy) or one too many (trisomy). Aneuploidy can lead to embryo death or various clinical syndromes.
### Stem Cells

How do asymmetric stem cells differ from symmetric stem cells?
- Stem cells can divide asymmetrically or symmetrically. In asymmetric division, one cell with stem cell properties and one differentiating daughter cell are produced. Symmetric division serves self-reproduction, meaning two daughter cells with stem cell properties are produced. This leads to the proliferation of stem cells, which is important, for example, for wound healing.
What are induced pluripotent stem cells?
- Induced pluripotent stem cells are derived from differentiated body cells which are artificially changed in their genome (“reprogramming”) and converted back into pluripotent stem cells. The discovery of this possibility revolutionized stem cell research!
### Molecular Biology of Development

What function do transcription factors have? Which transcription factors do you know?
- The presence or absence of certain transcription factors determines the expression of genes: the DNA domains of transcription factors interact with specific sequences in the promoter of the gene and thus influence transcription. Transcription factors include homeobox proteins (= Hox proteins), Pax proteins, zinc finger proteins, helix-loop-helix proteins, and the testis-determining factor (TDF).
What is the function of E-cadherin and where is it found?
- E-cadherin is a Ca2+-dependent transmembrane protein (from English Calcium adherent) that causes adhesion (i.e., attachment) of cells to their neighboring cells (e.g., as part of desmosomes). During embryonic development, its expression is physiologically low in many cells, thus enabling cell migration. In tumor cells such as malignant epithelial cells (= carcinoma cells), E-cadherin may also be expressed to a small degree. This allows these tumor cells to detach from the cell cluster and spread via the blood or lymphatic system (= metastasize).
