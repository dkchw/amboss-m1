# Pelvic cavity
## Summary

The pelvic cavity is located within the bony pelvis. The transition to the abdominal cavity is gradual upwards: parts of the abdominal organs lie in the pelvic space; the peritoneum (abdominal lining) also covers parts of the pelvic organs in women. Downwards, the pelvic cavity is limited by the so-called pelvic floor. This consists of several overlapping muscle plates that hold the pelvic organs in place and play an important role in continence.

In the pelvic cavity run large vessels and nerve plexuses that supply the lower extremity and the pelvic area: the iliac vessels with their branches, the lumbosacral plexus, and various lymph vessels.
## Structure of the Pelvic Cavity

The pelvis is located between the abdomen and the lower extremity and is divided into a large and a small pelvis. The linea terminalis serves as a separation between the two sections. In a stricter sense, the term "pelvis" often refers only to the small pelvis, which also contains the pelvic organs. The large pelvis contains abdominal organs and is therefore functionally more akin to the abdominal cavity.

### Pelvic cavity

The pelvic cavity is divided into a peritoneal space and a subperitoneal space. Below that, the pelvic floor muscles follow.

#### Peritoneal Relationships

The peritoneum folds from the anterior abdominal wall over the apex of the bladder. In men, it then extends backward over the upper part of the bladder and folds from there onto the rectum. In women, the uterus lies between the bladder and rectum, its surface largely covered by peritoneum.

- Protrusions of the peritoneum
    - Rectovesical excavation (Proust space) (♂): Depression between the bladder and rectum
    - Excavatio vesicouterina (♀): Depression between the bladder and uterus
    - Rectouterine excavation (Douglas space) (♀): Depressed area between the uterus and rectum
- Intraperitoneal organs of the pelvic cavity
    - ♀ and ♂

> [!NOTE]
> The rectovesical excavation (♂) or rectouterine excavation (♀) forms the lowest point of the peritoneal cavity in a standing human!

> [!NOTE]
> In women, the small pelvis contains the following intraperitoneal organs: uterus, fallopian tube, ovary!

> [!NOTE] Douglas Space
> The rectouterine excavation (Douglas pouch) is of clinical significance as it can be easily accessed from the vagina. Using ultrasound, for example, the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and anterior wall of the rectum can be examined. In the case of an inflammation in the abdominal cavity, pus collections may occur in the Douglas pouch (so-called Douglas abscess), which can also be punctured from the vagina. Intraperitoneal bleeding or peritoneal carcinomatosis (malignant processes of the peritoneum) can also be detected through a puncture of the Douglas pouch.

#### Spaces of the pelvic cavity

The pelvic cavity can be divided into three levels from top to bottom. At the very top is the peritoneal cavity, which functionally belongs to the abdominal cavity. Below it lies the subperitoneal (or supralevator) space, located between the pelvic organs and the M. levator ani. Beneath the M. levator ani is the infralevator space. The spaces are each filled with connective tissue and contain various structures.

##### Ischioanal fossa

The ischioanal fossa is a wedge-shaped space in the posterior pelvic floor filled with fat (corpus adiposum fossae ischioanalis) and connective tissue. On the lateral side of the ischioanal fossa, the pudendal canal contains a vascular-nervous bundle consisting of the internal pudendal artery and vein and the pudendal nerve.

## Pelvic Floor

The pelvic floor forms the lower boundary of the small pelvis. It is mainly composed of skeletal muscle - the so-called pelvic floor muscles - as well as connective tissue components. The pelvic floor serves as the caudal and dorsal closure of the pelvic cavity. It primarily ensures the stability of the pelvic organs. Additionally, it plays an important role in continence.

- Portions of the pelvic floor: The pelvic floor is divided from top to bottom into three levels.
    1. Pelvic diaphragm
    2. Urogenital diaphragm
    3. Sphincters and erectile body muscles of the urogenital and intestinal tract

### The Muscle Layers of the Pelvic Floor

#### Muscles of the pelvic diaphragm

The muscles of the pelvic diaphragm are innervated by direct branches of the sacral plexus.

|Associated muscles|   |Origin|Insertion|Innervation|Special features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. levator ani|M. puborectalis|- Symphysis|- Tendinous center of the perineum<br>- Coccyx|- Sacral plexus|- Forms the so-called levator hiatus for the passage of the rectum, urethra - and in women the vagina - through the pelvic floor|
|M. pubococcygeus|- Pubic bone|
|M. iliococcygeus|- Fascia of the M. obturator internus|
|M. coccygeus|   |- Ischial spine|- Coccyx|- Additional reinforcement of the pelvic floor<br>- May sometimes be absent|

#### Muscles of the urogenital diaphragm

The muscles of the urogenital diaphragm are innervated by the pudendal nerve.

|Associated muscles|   |Origin|Insertion|Innervation|Special features|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. transversus perinei profundus|   |- R. of the ischium<br>- R. of the inferior pubic bone|- Perineal suture (Raphe perinei)|- Pudendal nerve|- Formed from fibers of the external urethral sphincter<br>- Forms the supporting plate of the pelvic floor|
|M. transversus perinei superficialis|   |- Ischial tuberosity|- Tendinous center of the perineum|- Supports the deep transverse perineal muscle<br>- Forms an additional closure of the levator ani|

#### Sphincter and erectile muscles

The sphincter and bulbospongiosus muscles form the bottom layer of the pelvic floor.

- Involved muscles
    - M. bulbospongiosus
    - M. ischiocavernosus
    - M. external anal sphincter

### Fascia of the Pelvic Floor

- Superior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm: Covers cranially the pelvic diaphragm (M. levator ani and M. coccygeus)
- Inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm: Covers the caudal side of the pelvic diaphragm (M. levator ani and M. coccygeus)
- Fascia diaphragmatis urogenitalis superior: Covers cranially the urogenital diaphragm (Mm. transversus perinei profundus and superficialis)
- Fascia of the inferior urogenital diaphragm: Covers caudally the urogenital diaphragm (Mm. transversus perinei profundus and superficialis)

> [!NOTE] Uterine prolapse
> Normally, the organs of the small pelvis are held in position by the pelvic floor like a tight hammock. Especially in women who have given birth to several children, there can be a weakening of the pelvic floor with subsequent descent of the organs as they age. In the worst case, the uterus may slip out through the vagina (uterine prolapse). For this reason, it is recommended that women strengthen their pelvic floor muscles again after childbirth with the help of pelvic floor training.

## Nerve pathways of the pelvis

### Arteries

The arteries supplying the pelvis and lower extremity originate from the abdominal aorta. This divides at the bifurcation of the aorta approximately at the level of lumbar vertebra 4 into two common iliac arteries, which shortly thereafter split into an internal iliac artery and an external iliac artery, respectively. The internal iliac artery, with its visceral branches, is primarily responsible for the supply of the pelvic organs, while its parietal branches are involved in supplying the lower extremity. The external iliac artery also gives off some branches to supply the pelvis, then passes through the lacuna vasorum and becomes the femoral artery.

#### Common iliac

The abdominal aorta splits at the aortic bifurcation into the right and left common iliac arteries, which in turn shortly thereafter each divide into an internal and an external iliac artery.

#### Internal iliac artery

##### Parietal branches of the internal iliac artery

|Main Outflows|Course, Branches, Special Features|Service Area|
|---|---|---|
|A. iliolumbalis|- Pulls diagonally upwards towards the M. iliopsoas<br>- Divides into two smaller branches|- M. psoas major<br>- M. iliacus|
|Lateral sacral arteries|- Superior branch: Pulls medially → Enters the first or second anterior sacral foramen → Gives off small branches → Exits from a posterior sacral foramen again → Branches into the musculature<br>- Inferior branch: Passes over the piriformis muscle → Travels medially along the sacral foramina on the sacrum downwards → Gives off small branches that enter and exit the sacral foramina and form anastomoses with the middle sacral artery!|- Sacral canal<br>- Piriformis muscle<br>- Muscles and skin dorsal to the sacrum|
|A. glutea superior|- Passes together with the eponymous nerve through the suprapiriform foramen<br>    - R. superficialis: Branches in the gluteus maximus muscle → Anastomoses with the inferior gluteal artery and lateral sacral arteries<br>    - R. profundus: Splits under the gluteus medius muscle into many small branches|- Gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus muscles<br>- Piriformis muscle<br>- Tensor fasciae latae muscle<br>- Skin over the sacrum|
|A. obturatoria|- Runs along the lateral wall of the pelvis downward and forward → Gives off branches to the ilium and iliacus muscle → Passes through the obturator canal → Gives off additional branches<br>    - Branches within the pelvis<br>        - Rr. iliaci<br>        - R. vesicalis<br>        - R. pubicus → Anastasizes with the inferior epigastric artery (Corona mortis)<br>    - Branches outside the pelvis<br>        - R. posterior (→ R. acetabularis → A. capitis femoris)<br>        - R. anterior|- Ilium<br>- Iliacus muscle<br>- Adductors of the thigh<br>- Pubis<br>- External hip muscles<br>- Femoral head|
|A. glutea inferior|- Runs along the M. piriformis in a downward direction → Passes together with various vessels through the infrapiriform foramen → Runs together with the N. cutaneus femoris and the N. ischiadicus and is covered by the M. gluteus maximus between the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity to the skin of the lower buttock and thigh|- Mm. glutei maximus, medius, and minimus<br>- M. piriformis<br>- M. quadratus femoris<br>- Skin of the lower buttock and upper thigh|

### Veins

In the pelvis, on both sides, the external iliac veins, which carry blood from the lower extremities, merge with the internal iliac veins, which collect blood from the pelvic cavity. The two combine to form a common iliac vein, which in turn joins to form the inferior vena cava.

|V. iliaca externa|- V. femoralis<br>- V. epigastrica inferior|- Originates from the V. femoralis after its passage through the Lacuna vasorum → Runs together with the A. iliaca externa → Joins in the small pelvis with the V. iliaca interna to form the V. iliaca communis|- V. iliaca communis|
|V. iliaca communis|- V. iliaca externa<br>- V. iliaca interna|- Arises from the confluence of the V. iliaca externa and the V. iliaca interna → Runs together with the A. iliaca communis cranially and medially → The right and left V. iliaca communis unite at the level of LWK 5 to form the V. cava inferior|- V. cava inferior|

### Lymph Vessels

The lymphatic vessels of the lower extremity are discussed in the chapter "Conduits of the Lower Extremity," those of the pelvic and abdominal cavity in the chapter "Abdominal Cavity."
## Review Questions on the Chapter Pelvic Cavity
### Structure of the Pelvic Cavity

What are the peritoneal relations in the pelvic cavity?
- The pelvic cavity is divided into a peritoneal space and a subperitoneal space, which is why some organs lie intraperitoneally and others subperitoneally. There are sex-specific outpouchings of the peritoneum: In men, the rectovesical pouch, which lies between the bladder and the rectum; in women, the vesicouterine pouch between the bladder and the uterus as well as the rectouterine pouch (= Douglas pouch), which is located between the uterus and the rectum.

What is referred to as the greater and lesser pelvis? How are they distinguished from each other and what forms the lower boundary of the pelvic cavity?
- The pelvis is divided into a greater and a lesser pelvis. The greater pelvis contains abdominal organs, which is why functionally it counts more as part of the abdominal cavity (abdomen). The lesser pelvis contains the pelvic organs and is meant in the actual sense when referring to the "pelvis." The boundary between the two is the pelvic inlet plane (= Apertura pelvis superior). Laterally, it is limited by the linea terminalis or spans as an imaginary plane between the linea terminalis. The linea terminalis runs along the medial edges of the symphysis, pecten ossis pubis, arcuate line, and promontory. Caudally, the pelvic cavity is closed off by the pelvic floor musculature.

Which extra- or subperitoneal organs are located in the pelvic cavity?
- The extra- or subperitoneal organs in both sexes include the rectum and bladder. In women, the cervix uteri and vagina should also be mentioned; in men, the prostate and seminal vesicle are also included.

What is the ischioanal fossa, what does it contain, and what are its boundaries?
- The ischioanal fossa is a wedge-shaped space in the posterior pelvic floor and is filled with fat and connective tissue. Caudally, it is limited by the deep transverse perineal muscle (= urogenital diaphragm); cranially, it extends to the meeting point of the levator ani muscle and the obturator internus muscle. The medial border is formed by the levator ani muscle and the external anal sphincter; laterally, the fascia of the obturator internus muscle and the ischial tuberosity close off the ischioanal fossa.

What is referred to as the bulb of the penis and in which section of the pelvis is it located?
- The bulb of the penis is the club-shaped widened base of the corpus spongiosum. It is located in the superficial perineal space (= superficial perineal pouch), which lies between the perineal membrane and the superficial perineal fascia (directly beneath the subcutaneous fat tissue).

### Pelvic Floor

What are the fasciae that limit the M. levator ani cranially and caudally called?
- The levator ani muscle is covered caudally and cranially by the superior and inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm.

### Nerve pathways of the pelvis

Pelvic organs and gluteal muscles are supplied by branches of the internal iliac artery. Which belong to its parietal branches, and which belong to its visceral branches?
- The three visceral branches of the internal iliac artery are the inferior vesical artery, the middle rectal artery, and the umbilical artery (which is largely obliterated postnatally); in women, there is additionally the uterine artery. Furthermore, the internal iliac artery also has some parietal branches: the iliolumbar artery, superior gluteal artery, and inferior gluteal artery, lateral sacral arteries, obturator artery, as well as the internal pudendal artery.
