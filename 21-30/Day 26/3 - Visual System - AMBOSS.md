# Visual System
## Summary

Seeing is a highly complex process that begins with light entering the eye. On one hand, it is subject to physical laws; on the other hand, it depends on the processing of stimuli in the brain. The most important functional units in seeing are the dioptric apparatus and the retina. The dioptric apparatus is responsible for projecting a smaller, inverted image onto the retina. The retina converts light impressions into electrical signals (so-called "transduction") and transmits them to the brain. The pathway of optical perception from the retina to the brain is referred to as the visual pathway.
## Dioptric Apparatus

In order for an object to be perceived clearly, the light rays that are reflected from it must converge at a point on the retina. The dioptric apparatus - consisting of the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous body - performs the necessary refraction of light for this purpose. These components of varying refractive power are arranged in series and together function like a converging lens. Thus, the light rays create a smaller and inverted image on the retina, which is "translated back" by the brain so that conscious vision can occur.

### Physical Principles

See also Optics and Optical Devices

If light strikes obliquely on the boundary between two media with different optical density, the light is refracted (i.e., it changes its direction of propagation).

- Refractive index (n)
    - Describes a material property (the so-called optical density), by which light rays are slowed down (compared to their propagation speed in a vacuum)
    - The higher the refractive index, the higher the optical density, the slower light propagates in the examined medium.
        - Air: n = 1.0003
        - Water: n = 1.33
        - Cornea: n = 1,376
        - Eye lens: n = 1,413
        - Kammerwasser: n = 1,336
        - Vitreous body: n = 1.336
- Refraction (= Light refraction): Change in the direction of the beam
    - Occurs at all interfaces between two materials with different refractive index (n)
    - The stronger the difference in refractive index, the more the light is refracted.
- Focal Point (F): Point where the broken light rays intersect that strike the lens parallel to the optical axis.
- Focal length (f): Distance from the center of the lens to the focus in meters (m)
- Refractive power (D): Reciprocal of the focal length in diopters (dpt) (D = 1/f → 1 dpt = 1/m)

> [!NOTE]
> The greater the difference in the refractive indices of two media, the more the direction of light is altered at the interface!

### Components and Breaking Strength

- Components: Cornea (+43 dpt), Lens (+19.5 dpt), Vitreous body and Aqueous humor (together -3.7 dpt)
- Combined refractive power (of the resting, far-accommodated eye): 58.8 dpt

> [!NOTE]
> The cornea has the highest refractive power of the dioptric apparatus, as it represents the boundary between air and liquid medium (strongly different refractive indices)!

### Function: Accommodation (Eye)

During accommodation, the curvature of the lens changes, thereby altering the overall refractive power of the eye. This makes it possible to project an object sharply onto the retina, regardless of whether it is far away or close to the eye. The further an object is away, the more parallel the incoming light rays are, and the lower the refractive power needs to be. Conversely, the required refractive power must be higher the closer the object to be depicted is to the eye, so that the image can be sharply projected onto the retina.

- Basic principle: The lens is suspended by the zonular fibers and can change its shape and thus its refractive power by altering the tension of the fibers.

#### Nahakkommodation

- Principle: Contraction of the ciliary muscle → zonular fibers relax → Lens rounds due to its own elasticity → Refractive power increases
- Near point: The closest point that can still be seen sharply (is about 10 cm for normally sighted young adults)
- Close-up reaction
    - Approaching the visual axes (convergence movement)
    - Constriction of the pupils by the M. sphincter pupillae (Miosis)
    - Increase in breaking strength
- Lens breaking strength: High
- Total refractive power of the eye: Up to 73 dpt

#### Fernakkommodation

- Principle: Passive pulling forces from the rupture membrane and sclera → Zonular fibers are taut at rest → Lens is flat → Low refractive power
- Focal point: The farthest point that can still be seen sharply (is at infinity for those with normal vision)
- Remote adjustment reaction
    - Divergence of the line of sight (divergence movement)
    - Dilation of the pupils by the M. dilatator pupillae (Mydriasis)
    - Reduction of the refraction power
- Lens refractive power: Low
- Total refractive power of the eye: approx. 59 dpt

> [!NOTE]
> Since the near accommodation is an active process (contraction of the ciliary muscle), the resting state of the eye is the far accommodation!

#### Accommodation Width

The accommodative range is the range in which the eye can change its focusing power when switching between distant and near vision.

- Calculation: Accommodation width (dpt) = 1/Near point (m) – 1/Far point (m)

> [!NOTE]
> In youth, the accommodation range is still about 14 dpt, but in old age it can drop to about 1 dpt (presbyopia)!

## Refraction Anomalies

The individual components of the optical device must be precisely aligned, as even small deviations can manifest as refraction anomalies (= refractive errors of the eye). This includes conditions such as nearsightedness (= myopia) and farsightedness (= hyperopia). In both cases, there is a mismatch between the lens power and the length of the eyeball. Due to this mismatch, the point of light is not displayed as a point, but as an area or distorted on the retina. The patient sees blurry.

### Myopia (= Nearsightedness)

- Pathophysiology: The eyeball is too long or the refractive power of the eye is too strong. The light rays from a point light source converge at a point in front of the retina and then diverge again.
- Symptoms/Clinic: Good near vision; poor distance vision
- Correction: Diverging lenses (concave lenses, minus lenses)

### Hyperopia (= Farsightedness)

- Pathophysiology: The eyeball is too short or the refractive power of the eye is too weak. The light rays from a point of light converge only behind the retina to form a point again.
- Symptoms/Clinic: Poor near vision; sharp distance vision possible only through accommodation.
- Correction: Collecting lenses (Convex lenses, Plus lenses)

### Astigmatism (= Corneal Curvature)

- Pathophysiology: Here, the cornea is not uniformly curved, causing light to be refracted differently and resulting in a distorted image.
- Symptoms/Clinic: Blurred vision at any distance
- Correction: Cylindrical glasses

### Presbyopia (= Age-related farsightedness)

- Pathophysiology: Reduced accommodation ability
- Symptoms/Clinic: Poor near vision (e.g., problems reading), good distance vision
    - Since the accommodation ability is reduced, it may happen that a hyperope(!) person can no longer see objects in the distance clearly at an older age.
- Correction: Reading glasses with collecting lens (convex lenses)

### Aphakia

- Pathophysiology: Lens is missing (usually due to surgical removal in the case of lens opacification (= Cataract))
- Symptoms/Clinic: Severe hyperopia, objects at any distance cannot be sharply imaged on the retina
- Correction: Nowadays mainly art lenses; in rare cases so-called "star glasses" (collecting lens with up to 15 dpt)

> [!NOTE]
> Since the far point in hyperopia lies "behind infinity," constant accommodation is necessary. This coupling of convergence and accommodation leads to overexertion of the eye's internal muscles. Such hyperopia can lead to esotropia!

## Cells of the Retina

The retina is, from an embryological perspective, part of the diencephalon. It has a light-sensitive part (pars optica) and a light-insensitive part (pars caeca). In the pars optica, the conversion of light stimuli into membrane potentials (= signal transduction) occurs, along with the first neural processing of the information. For the capture of optical stimuli, the first three neurons of the visual pathway are located in the pars optica: photoreceptor cells (1st neuron), bipolar cells (2nd neuron), and ganglion cells (3rd neuron). Since there are approximately 130 million photoreceptor cells in the eye, but only about 1 million ganglion cells, the information must be bundled. For this purpose, many photoreceptor cells are connected to significantly fewer bipolar cells, which in turn pass the information on to only one ganglion cell. This principle is called signal convergence. Additionally, two interneurons play an important role in signal transmission within the retina: the horizontal cells, which connect neighboring photoreceptor cells to each other, and the amacrine cells, which are in contact with the axons of the bipolar cells and the dendrites of the ganglion cells.

### Photoreceptors

There are two different types of photoreceptors: cones and rods. They are present only in the light-sensitive part of the retina (pars optica), with a total ratio of cones to rods of about 1:20. The photoreceptors consist of an axon, cell body, and light-sensitive extension, which is further divided into an outer and inner segment. The outer segments contain the visual pigments (also known as “visual dyes”) that are stimulated by the energy of incoming light to undergo a chemical conformational change. The adequate stimulus for the photoreceptors is light, specifically electromagnetic waves in the visible wavelength range of 400–750 nm.

#### Cones (Photoreceptors)

- Spectrum: Adopt the photopic vision
- Location: Highest density in the fovea centralis
- Number: Approximately 6 million
- Sehpigment: Three different cone opsins with varying absorption maxima (420 nm, 535 nm, 565 nm), see: Color Vision
- Resolution: In the fovea centralis high

#### Rods (Photoreceptors)

The rods are more light-sensitive than the cones and therefore react even in dim light.

- Spectrum: Take over the scotopic vision
- Location: Highest density in the parafoveal zone (about 10° to 40° away from the foveal center), no occurrence in the fovea centralis
- Number: Approximately 120 million
- Sehpigment: Rhodopsin with an absorption maximum of about 500 nm
- Resolution: Rather low

> [!NOTE]
> In the fovea centralis, there are no rods, only cones!

### Bipolar Cells

The bipolar cells receive information (glutamate release) from the photoreceptors and transmit it to the ganglion cells. Three different types of bipolar cells are distinguished: on-cone bipolar cells, off-cone bipolar cells, and rod bipolar cells.

- On-Opponent Bipolar Cells
    - Possess a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGLUR) and are inhibited by the glutamate released by the cones in darkness.
    - Are excited when little or no glutamate is released (light signal)
- Off-Zapfenbipolar cells
    - Primarily possess an ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGLUR) and are excited by the glutamate released by the cones in darkness.
    - Are inhibited when little or no glutamate is released (light signal)
- Rod bipolar cells
    - Rods possess only one type of bipolar cell (On-rod bipolar cell)
    - They become excited when little or no glutamate is released (light signal) and transmit this signal through the amacrine cells to the on-bipolar cells.
    - Are inhibited when glutamate is released (dark signal) and transmit this signal through the amacrine cells to the Off-cone bipolar cells further

### Ganglion Cells

The ganglion cells receive information from the bipolar cells and transmit it to the brain. Their axons form the optic nerve. As with the bipolar cells, on-center and off-center cells are distinguished (on-center ganglion cells and off-center ganglion cells). In addition, three groups can be distinguished morphologically: the fast-conducting M-cells of the magno-cellular system and the slow-conducting P- and K-cells of the parvo-cellular and konio-cellular systems. There are also some ganglion cells that contain a visual pigment (melanopsin) and are thus photosensitive, like the rods and cones. However, their information does not serve vision, but rather the light-induced synchronization of the circadian rhythm (day-night phases) as well as the control of pupil movement and reflexive eye movements.

#### On- and Off-Center Ganglion Cells

- Wiring of the cones (direct path)
    - On-center ganglion cells: Illumination in the center of the receptive field of the cones → Glutamate release↓ → Depolarization (excitation) of the on-cone bipolar cells and glutamate release from these cells↑ → Depolarization (excitation) of the on-center ganglion cells; Illumination in the periphery of the receptive field inhibits them (among other things, through horizontal cells)
    - Off-center ganglion cells: Illumination in the center of the receptive field of the cones → glutamate release↓ → hyperpolarization (inhibition) of the off-cone bipolar cells and glutamate release from these cells↓ → hyperpolarization (inhibition) of the off-center ganglion cells; illumination in the periphery of the receptive field excites them (among other things through horizontal cells)
- Circuitry of the rods (lateral pathway): Illumination of the rods → Depolarization (excitation) of the rod bipolar cells → Depolarization (excitation) of the amacrine cells → Excitation of the On-bipolar cellsbipolar cells or inhibition of the Off-bipolar cellsbipolar cells → Depolarization of the On-center ganglion cells or hyperpolarization of the Off-center ganglion cells

#### Morphological Groups

The ganglion cells are classified into three morphologically and functionally distinct groups. The three cell types give rise to different systems, which in turn perform various functions in vision.

- M-cells (= magnocellular system)
    - Number: About 10% of the ganglion cells
    - Propagation speed: Fast
    - Function: Detection of movement and distance of objects
    - Forwarding: To the primary visual cortex
- P-cells (= parvocellular system)
    - Number: About 80% of the ganglion cells
    - Conduction velocity: Slow
    - Structure: Smaller receptive fields → High spatial and low temporal resolution
    - Function: Capture of color and shape of the objects
    - Forwarding: To the primary visual cortex
- K-cells (= konio cellular system)
    - Number: About 10% of the ganglion cells
    - Transmission speed: Slow
    - Function: Control of pupil movement and reflexive eye movements
    - Forwarding: To the midbrain
## Signal Processing in the Retina

The signal processing of a light stimulus begins in the photoreceptors (rods and cones), which are located in the light-sensitive part of the retina. Since the photoreceptors are already depolarized at rest, the light stimulus causes hyperpolarization, which is transmitted to the bipolar cells. The photoreceptors are capable of adapting to different lighting conditions; this process is called adaptation. Furthermore, the cones can process different color impressions, resulting in light with a wavelength between approximately 400 nm (blue-violet) and 750 nm (red) leading to various color perceptions.

### Signal Transduction within the Photoreceptors

The resting potential of the photoreceptors is about -30mV; thus, they are already relatively strongly depolarized at rest. The reason for this is the high conductivity for Na+ and Ca2+ ions in darkness. A light stimulus causes the channels for these ions to close, leading to hyperpolarization with reduced release of the transmitter glutamate. The following diagram illustrates the signal transduction in the rods as an example. In the cones, it proceeds similarly, except that instead of rhodopsin, cone opsins are used.

#### Rods before exposure (= darkness)

In darkness, the visual pigment rhodopsin is in its resting state; the conductivity of the cell membrane for sodium and calcium is high, causing the cell to be depolarized.

- Ground state of the visual pigment rhodopsin: G-protein-coupled receptor, which consists of opsin (glycoprotein) and 11-cis-retinal (vitamin A derivative)
- Ground state of the rods: Depolarized
    - High Na+ and Ca2+ conductance through opened cGMP-dependent channels (CNG channels) → Constant influx of cations → Depolarization of the cell ("dark signal") → Release of glutamate
    - Resting potential: About -30 mV

#### Sticks during exposure

1. Conversion of 11-cis-retinal into all-trans-retinal through a light-induced isomerization and conversion of rhodopsin into meta-rhodopsin II ("active rhodopsin")
2. Meta-Rhodopsin II binds to the G-Protein Transducin and activates it → exchange of GDP for GTP at the α-subunit of the Transducins → release of the α-subunit
3. The released α-transducin subunit leads to the stimulation of the cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE), which hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP.
4. Decrease of cGMP concentration → Closure of cGMP-dependent channels (CNG channels) → Decrease of Na+ and Ca2+ conductivity → Decrease of cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ concentration
5. Hyperpolarization of the cell ("light signal") and inhibition of glutamate release to bipolar cells

#### Rods after exposure

1. The termination of light exposure inactivates the α-subunit of transducin and rebinds to the β- and γ-subunits → Inactivation of the cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase
2. Additionally, the low Ca2+ concentration activates a guanylate cyclase that synthesizes cGMP
3. Reopening of the Na+ and Ca2+ channels (CNG channels) through accumulation of cGMP → Phosphorylation of the active rhodopsin (Meta-rhodopsin II)
4. The protein arrestin binds to the phosphorylated rhodopsin and seals it.
5. Detachment of all-trans-retinal from opsin → Enzymatic regeneration to 11-cis-retinal in pigment epithelial cells.
6. Connection of 11-cis-Retinal and Opsin to Rhodopsin

> [!NOTE]
> Photoreceptors respond to a light stimulus with hyperpolarization!

> [!NOTE] Vitamin A Deficiency 
> Due to insufficient intake of Vitamin A, there is a disturbed formation of Rhodopsin. Infections can also trigger a Vitamin A deficiency, typically, for example, during measles infections. Initially, the deficiency manifests as night blindness, as the rods react more strongly than the cones.

### Adaptation

The adaptation is the ability of the retina to adjust to different lighting conditions.

#### Dark adaptation (scotopic vision)

- Transition from cone to rod vision: The light-sensitive rods take over vision in darkness when the minimum perception threshold of the cones is reached (this is visible in a graphical adaptation curve after about 10 minutes at the so-called Kohlrausch inflection point).
- Pupil dilation: Ensures greater light intake in darkness.
- Increase in rhodopsin concentration: The more rhodopsin present, the higher the light sensitivity.
- Spatial Summation: Expansion of the receptive fields in darkness due to a decrease in lateral inhibition → Increased light sensitivity of the neurons
- Temporal Summation: Subthreshold stimuli become suprathreshold when they persist over a longer period of time.
- Purkinje Effect: A blue point appears brighter than a red point in darkness because in low light conditions, primarily the rods are active, which have an absorption maximum in the short-wavelength (about 500 nm) blue-green range.
- Decrease in flicker fusion frequency
- Decrease in visual acuity
- Decrease in contrast vision

#### Helladaptation (photopic vision)

- Transition from rod to cone vision: Perception occurs exclusively through cone cells.
- Positioning of the pupil
- Decrease in rhodopsin concentration
- Increase in flicker fusion frequency
- Increase in visual acuity
- Increase in contrast vision

#### "Twilight Vision" (Mesopic Vision)

- Both rods and cones are active.

> [!NOTE]
> Since the point of sharpest vision is located in the fovea centralis and only cones are present there, proper fixation can no longer be achieved from the point of pure rod vision!

### Color Vision

Visible light has a wavelength between about 400 nm (blue-violet) and 750 nm (red). A blue object appears blue, for example, because it absorbs wavelengths other than the blue spectrum; thus, the blue wavelengths are reflected.

- Principle: There are three different cones (red, blue, and green) for color vision with different opsins, through whose excitation the different color impressions arise.
- Dispersion: The refraction of light depends on the wavelength of the light.
    - The smaller the wavelength, the stronger the refraction.
    - Example: Red Light
        - Red light has a long wavelength, which is why the refraction is weak and the eye must accommodate more to focus.
        - Strong accommodation "enlarges" the red dot and makes it appear closer than a blue dot.
- Tap types
    - Blue-(K)-cones: Absorb blue-violet light and have an absorption maximum at about 420 nm
    - Green-(M)-cones: Absorb blue-green to yellow light and have an absorption maximum at about 535 nm.
    - Red-(L)-Cone: Absorb yellow to red light and have an absorption maximum at about 565 nm.
- Forms of color mixing
    - Additive color mixing: Mixing of light (e.g., in a television) of different wavelengths → A new color impression is created (the spectrum is larger after the mixing than before)
    - Subtractive color mixing: Mixing of colors (e.g., in painting) of different wavelengths → A new color impression is created (the spectrum is smaller after mixing than before, as the wavelengths of both colors are absorbed)

> [!NOTE]
> When wavelengths of the entire spectrum are mixed, the impression of the color "white" is created!

> [!NOTE] Color anomalies
> The term color anomaly refers to a genetic disorder of color vision, in which one (or more) of the three types of cones is not functioning normally. Color anomalies are generally X-chromosomal-recessively inherited, which is why primarily men are affected. In the so-called dichromacy, only two (of the physiologically three) cone types in the retina are functioning normally. The most common form is deuteranomaly (green weakness), which occurs in about 5% of the male population. Deuteranopia (green blindness), protanomaly (red weakness), and protanopia (red blindness) occur with a frequency of 1% each in the male population, making them somewhat rarer. In a so-called red-green weakness, affected individuals can still perceive the colors "red" and "green," but they confuse them.

### Visual Field

The visual field is the area that can be seen while an object is being fixated - that is, the optically perceivable area without eye movement and with a stationary head position. It can be measured with a perimeter.

- Monocular field of view: Observable with one eye
- Binocular visual field: Observable with both eyes simultaneously.
- Through perimetry, visual fields for achromatic light stimuli and for the detection of colored light stimuli can be measured: detection of light stimuli occurs depending on the color sensitivity of the retina; initially the extreme periphery with a color-blind area, then blue, red, and green sensitivity.
## Cable Car

The visual pathway consists of four neurons and transmits the optical stimulus from the retina to the visual cortex of the brain.

- 1. Neuron: Photoreceptors
    - Transmission from the photoreceptor to bipolar cells via glutamate receptors
- 2. Neuron: Bipolar cells
    - On-Bipolar cells: Metabotropic (G-Protein-coupled) glutamate receptors
    - Off-Bipolar Cells: Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors
- 3. Neuron: Retinal Ganglion Cells
    - The axons of the ganglion cells form the optic nerve
        - The axons of the temporal retinal areas (= visual information from the medial visual field) run laterally
        - The axons of the nasal retinal areas (= visual information from the temporal visual field) run medially
        - The axons from the lower retinal area run in the lower part
        - The axons from the upper retinal area run in the upper part
- The optic nerve leaves the bulb at the optic disc: Since there are no photoreceptors present here, this spot is also called the "blind spot"
- Optic chiasm: Union of the optic nerves from both sides directly above the pituitary gland
    - The fibers of the nasal retina regions cross to the opposite side.
- Optic tract: Contains the fibers of the ipsilateral temporal and contralateral nasal retina halves.
- 4. Neuron: Lateral geniculate body in the Thalamus
    - Conducts the stimulus to the visual cortex (= striate area)

> [!NOTE] Disorders of the Visual Pathway  
> In a variety of neurological disorders or diseases of the eye, the wiring of the visual pathway can be disrupted. This can lead to impairments that, depending on their location, result in visual disturbances in typical areas of the visual field. Based on localization and symptomatology, the diseases can be divided into three sections: prechiasmal diseases (= disruption in the optic nerve), chiasmal diseases (= disruption in the optic chiasm), or retrochiasmal diseases (= disruption in the area of the optic tract up to the visual cortex). In prechiasmal diseases, there are usually unilateral visual field losses on the same side as the lesion. Chiasmal diseases typically lead to bitemporal hemianopsia (= loss of both temporal visual fields), and retrochiasmal diseases – for example, in the area of the left optic tract or due to occlusion of the left posterior cerebral artery – can lead to homonymous hemianopsia to the right.

## Visual Cortex

The fibers of the 4th neuron reach the visual cortex via the optic radiation (= Radiatio optica). This is divided into the primary and the secondary visual cortex.

- Primary visual cortex (= Area striata)
    - Located in the occipital lobe in area 17 according to Brodmann on both sides of the calcarine sulcus [1]
    - Retinotopic organization: Points that are neighboring on the retina are also represented as neighboring here.
    - Here the awareness of visual impressions takes place.
    - Lamina IV: End myelinated fibers of the optic radiation with macroscopically visible stripe (Gennari stripe)
- Secondary visual cortex
    - Located in areas 18 and 19 according to Brodmann
    - Surround the primary visual cortex in a horseshoe shape
    - Here the interpretation and processing of the visual impressions take place.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Visual System
### Dioptric Apparatus

What is the near point and what is the far point?
- The near point is the closest point that can still be seen clearly. Analogously, the far point is the furthest point that can still be seen clearly.
What is the accommodation width and how can it be calculated?
- The accommodation width is the range in which sharp vision is possible. It lies between the far and near points and is given in diopters (dpt, 1/m). The accommodation width is calculated from the reciprocal of the near point in meters minus the reciprocal of the far point in meters (accommodation width (dpt) = 1/near point (m) - 1/far point (m)).
Where is the far point of a person with normal vision (emmetropic)?
- The far point of a person with normal vision lies at infinity!
How does the near accommodation of the eyes occur? How does the far accommodation occur?
- Near accommodation is an active process that occurs through contraction of the ciliary muscle: when the muscle contracts, the zonular fibers relax and the lens can bulge according to its elasticity; the refractive power increases and near objects can be focused sharply. Far accommodation, on the other hand, is a passive process caused by the tensile forces of the sclera and Bruch’s membrane. These tensile forces flatten the lens, reducing the refractive power so that distant objects can be seen sharply.
What happens during the near reflex reaction?
- The near reflex reaction occurs during visual fixation of a near object and is thus part of near accommodation. Three steps lead to adjustment: 1. Convergence movement of the visual axes to avoid double images; 2. Narrowing of the pupils by the sphincter pupillae muscle (miosis) to improve depth of field; 3. Contraction of the ciliary muscle to achieve increased refractive power.
How high is the total refractive power of the eye? Which part of the dioptric apparatus has the largest share in this?
- The total refractive power of the eye is about 59 dpt, with the cornea as the interface between air and liquid medium contributing the largest share with 43 dpt.
### Refraction Anomalies

How does myopia develop and what are the clinical symptoms?
- In myopia (nearsightedness), the refractive power of the eye is too strong or the eyeball is too long. Therefore, the light rays from a point source converge before the retina and diverge again afterward. The result is good near vision and poor distance vision.
How does hyperopia develop and what are the clinical symptoms?
- In hyperopia (farsightedness), the refractive power of the eye is too weak or the eyeball is too short. Therefore, the light rays of a point source converge only behind the retina, resulting in a blurred image on it and poor near vision. Sharp distance vision is only possible through accommodation, which can lead to inward squinting because of overexertion of the inner eye muscles.
Which refractive anomaly leads to a reduced accommodation ability? What symptoms do those affected report?
- Reduced accommodation ability occurs with presbyopia (age-related farsightedness). It leads to poor near vision while distance vision remains good.
How can it happen that a patient with presbyopia also reports issues with distance vision?
- In presbyopia, reduced accommodation ability causes impaired near vision while distance vision is still problem-free. If hyperopia additionally exists alongside presbyopia, objects in the distance can no longer be seen clearly since with hyperopia sharp distance vision is only enabled by accommodation.
How does aphakia occur and what are the clinical symptoms?
- Aphakia refers to the absence of the lens (e.g., surgical removal due to cataract). Because the eye is no longer capable of accommodation, objects at any distance cannot be sharply imaged on the retina.
### Cells of the Retina

Which photosensitive cells in the eye do you know?
- The photosensitive cells include cones and rods — the photoreceptors of the eye that serve vision. Additionally, some ganglion cells contain the visual pigment melanopsin, which is important for light-induced synchronization of the circadian rhythm. Therefore, they are also counted among the photosensitive cells.
What are the visual pigments of the cones called? What are their absorption maxima?
- The visual pigments of cones are called cone opsins and are responsible for color vision. They have absorption maxima at 420 nm (blue), 535 nm (green), and 565 nm (red).
What role do the rods play in vision? What are their visual pigments called and what is their absorption maximum?
- Rods are more light-sensitive than cones and are responsible for scotopic vision, i.e., night and black-and-white vision. Their visual pigment is rhodopsin with an absorption maximum of about 500 nm.
Where do cones and rods have their highest density on the retina?
- Cones are found exclusively in the fovea centralis, i.e., the site of the sharpest vision is night blind. Rods have their highest density in the parafoveal zone. The density of both photoreceptors decreases toward the periphery.
How can ganglion cells be distinguished based on their conduction velocity?
- Three groups of ganglion cells are distinguished: M-, P-, and K-cells. M-cells belong to the magnocellular system and conduct fast. P-cells (parvocellular) and K-cells (konio-cellular) conduct slowly.
### Signal Processing in the Retina

What is the ground state of the visual pigment rhodopsin? What is it made of?
- Rhodopsin is in its depolarized ground state in darkness. It is a G-protein-coupled receptor composed of opsin and 11-cis-retinal.
What reactions occur in a rod cell during exposure to light?
- Upon illumination, 11-cis-retinal undergoes light-induced isomerization to all-trans-retinal. Likewise, rhodopsin is converted into the active meta-rhodopsin II, which binds to the G-protein transducin and activates it: GDP is exchanged for GTP on the α-subunit of transducin, which is then released. The freed α-transducin subunit stimulates cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP. As a result, the cGMP concentration decreases, cGMP-dependent ion channels close, and the cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ concentrations fall. The cell hyperpolarizes and glutamate release is inhibited.
What role does the protein arrestin play in photo-signal processing?
- Arrestin binds meta-rhodopsin II and seals it, preventing further activation of transducin and interrupting the signal cascade.
How does the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal occur?
- After rhodopsin has been sealed by arrestin, all-trans-retinal separates from opsin, and enzymatic regeneration produces 11-cis-retinal. The 11-cis-retinal can then recombine with opsin to form rhodopsin again.
What does the so-called “Kohlrausch-Knick” represent?
- The so-called "Kohlrausch bend" is a graphical point in a dark adaptation curve of the eye. At the Kohlrausch bend, there is a transition from daytime vision (photopic vision) to night vision (scotopic vision), because this point marks the minimal perception threshold of cones, and from here the more light-sensitive rods take over further vision.
What does the Purkinje effect describe?
- The Purkinje effect describes how a blue point appears brighter than a red one in darkness. This is because rods, which have their absorption maximum in the short-wavelength blue-green range, are mainly active in the dark.
What does the term dispersion describe in relation to color vision? Describe this using the example of "red"!
- Dispersion describes how the refraction of light depends on its wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the greater the refraction. Since red light has a long wavelength, it is refracted less strongly, and the eye must accommodate more strongly to focus it precisely. This creates the impression that a red point is closer than, for example, a blue (short-wavelength) point.
### Visual Pathway

How is the wiring of the visual pathway structured and where are its four neurons located?
- The first neuron, the photoreceptors, transmits the stimulus via metabotropic or ionotropic glutamate receptors to the second neuron, the on- and off-bipolar cells. They forward it to the retinal ganglion cell, the third neuron. This means that the first three neurons of the visual pathway are already located in the retina. The axons of the retinal ganglion cells form the optic nerve, which joins with its counterpart in the optic chiasm. The nasal fibers cross to the opposite side and run with the ipsilateral temporal retinal halves to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus to the fourth neuron. From the thalamus, the signal is predominantly conveyed via the optic radiation to layer IV of the area striata of the visual cortex.
What disorders of the visual pathway can be distinguished? What is their respective clinical presentation?
- Prechiasmal, chiasmal, and retrochiasmal disorders are distinguished. In prechiasmal disorders, the optic nerve is damaged, causing unilateral visual field defects on the side of the lesion. A lesion in the optic chiasm usually leads to bitemporal hemianopia. Retrochiasmal disorders manifest, for example, as homonymous hemianopia.
