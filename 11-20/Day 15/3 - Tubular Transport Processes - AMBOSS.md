# Tubular Transport Processes
## Summary

One of the most important functions of the kidney is the filtration and excretion of urea-producing substances with urine. For this purpose, primary urine is initially filtered from the blood plasma in the glomeruli of the kidney and then processed in the tubular system of the nephron. Each section of the tubular system has a specific function: In the proximal nephron, small particles such as water, ions, glucose, and amino acids are initially reabsorbed, which are freely filtered in the glomerulus but are not to be excreted. The Henle loop mainly serves to maintain a concentration gradient in the renal interstitium (so-called corticomedullary concentration gradient), which is essential for urine concentration. This urine concentration, as well as the fine adjustment of the urine composition, then occurs in the distal nephron and in the collecting duct.
## Overview: The individual nephron segments

In the structuring of the tubular system of a nephron into individual sections, a functional classification is distinguished from an anatomical one, which, however, do not correspond.

|Functional tubular sections|Associated (anatomical) tubular sections|Higher-order function|Reabsorption|
|---|---|---|---|
|- Proximal Nephron|- Proximal Tubule (Convoluted and Straight Part)|- Major reabsorption back into the blood|- Glucose, Amino Acids, Phosphate (each 100 %)<br>- Bicarbonate (95 %)<br>- Uric Acid (90 %)<br>- NaCl, Water, Potassium, Calcium (each 65 %)<br>- Magnesium (15 %)|
|- Henle's loop |- Straight part of the proximal tubule<br>- Intermediate tubule<br>- Straight part of the distal tubule |- Urine concentration |- Magnesium (75%)<br>- NaCl, water (each 20%)<br>- Potassium (25%)|
|- Distal Nephron|- Distal Tubule (Convoluted Part)<br>- Collecting Duct|- Fine-tuning of Urine Composition (regulated by hormones)|- Distal Tubule<br>    - Calcium (35 %)<br>    - NaCl, Water (each 10 %)<br>    - Magnesium (5–10 %)<br>- Collecting Duct<br>    - NaCl, Water (each 4 %)<br>    - Urea<br>    - H+ and HCO3-|
## Proximal Nephron

In the proximal nephron (= proximal tubule), large amounts of substances are reabsorbed from the primary urine. These substances pass through the tubular epithelium in different ways: either through the epithelial cells (= transcellular) or between the cells (= paracellular). Depending on the section of the tubule (early proximal vs. late proximal), one of these two reabsorption mechanisms predominates.

### Different Absorption Mechanisms

#### Transcellular Resorption

- Description: Transporters actively shuttle substances through the epithelial cells.
- Location: Predominantly early proximal
- Mechanism (secondary active transporter)
    1. Basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase transports (using ATP consumption) Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell.
    2. Formation of a high electrochemical gradient for Na+
    3. The transport of sodium into the cell (= driving force) occurs either via symport or antiport with other substances.
- Important transporters
    - Apical
        - Na+/Glucose Symporter (also known as SGLT1/SGLT2 Transporter)
        - Na+/amino acid symporter
        - Na+/Phosphate Symporter
        - Na+/H+-antiporter
    - Basolateral
        - Na+/3HCO3--Symporter (also known as NBC1-Transporter): Transports sodium and bicarbonate ions against their chemical gradient from the cell into the renal interstitium

> [!NOTE]
> In the early proximal tubule, the reabsorption of most substances is linked to sodium reabsorption!

#### Paracellular Resorption

- Description: Passive transport of dissolved substances (e.g. ions) between the tubular epithelial cells
- Prerequisite: "Leaky" Tight Junctions (so-called leaky Tight Junctions), in which Claudins are significantly involved, between the epithelial cells.
- Location: Predominantly late proximal
- Two mechanisms drive this form of resorption.
    1. Transepithelial Potential
    2. Solvent Drag

##### Transepithelial Potential

- Description
    - In tubular epithelial cells, two different electrical potentials can be measured: the luminal and the basolateral potential.
    - The transepithelial potential describes the difference between these two potentials.
- The transepithelial potential changes along the proximal tubule.
    - Early proximal: A lot of Na+ and thus positive charge is removed from the tubular lumen → The lumen becomes increasingly negative → A lumen-negative transepithelial potential is created
    - Late proximal: The lumen-negative potential pushes Cl- from the tubular lumen into the blood/interstitium → Cl- is reabsorbed → The lumen becomes increasingly positive → A lumen-positive transepithelial potential is generated → This pushes cations out of the lumen → Cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+) are reabsorbed

##### Solvent drag

- Description: Convective transport of substances dissolved in water
- Mechanism: Absorption of substances in the proximal tubule → An osmotic gradient forms between the tubular lumen and the interstitium → Following the gradient, water flows from the tubular lumen into the interstitium, "dragging" electrolytes and small molecules along with it.

> [!NOTE]
> In the early proximal tubule, positively charged sodium is removed from the tubular lumen – the lumen-negative transepithelial potential is generated!

> [!NOTE]
> In the late proximal tubule, negatively charged chloride is removed from the tubular lumen – the lumen-positive transepithelial potential is generated!

## Henle's Loop

The Henle loop can functionally be considered a section of the tubule, but anatomically/histologically it consists of different tubule regions. The most important task of the Henle loop is urine concentration.

- Classification
    - Thicker, descending part
    - Thinner descending and ascending part
    - Thicker, rising part
- Function: Urine concentration

### Transport processes in the Henle loop

#### Thin descending and ascending part of the Henle loop

The thin descending and ascending parts are collectively referred to as the intermediate tubule, but they have different functions. Overall, there are hardly any active transport processes occurring in the intermediate tubule.

- Descending intermediate tubule: Water reabsorption through aquaporin-1 channels (AQP 1)
- Ascending intermediate tubule: Impermeable to water; contains no aquaporins.

#### Thick ascending limb of the Henle loop

- Key Properties: Impermeable to water and permeable to NaCl
- Transcellular absorption
    - Main transporter: Na+/K+/2Cl--transporter (NKCC2)
        - Mechanism (secondary active transporter)
            1. Basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase generates a sodium gradient directed from the tubular lumen into the cell.
            2. Sodium follows this gradient and takes up one potassium and two chloride ions from the tubular lumen into the cell through the apical NKCC2. The following happens with these:
                - Sodium is extruded from the cell basolaterally by Na+/K+-ATPase.
                - Chloride is expelled from the cell basolaterally through chloride channels.
                - Potassium flows apically through potassium channels back into the lumen.
        - Follow
            - A positively charged particle (K+) returns to the lumen through apical channels (ROMK), two negative ions (Cl‑) and one positive ion (Na+) are reabsorbed.
            - Thus, a positive charge remains in the lumen.
            - A so-called lumen-positive transepithelial potential arises and provides the driving force for the resorption of additional cations: Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+
- Paracellular absorption: Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ (driven by the lumen-positive potential)

> [!NOTE]
> In the ascending part of the Henle loop, NaCl is reabsorbed via the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporter!

> [!NOTE] Furosemide
> The loop diuretic furosemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the loop of Henle by binding to it on the lumen side. Since this transporter is primarily responsible for sodium reabsorption and thus helps determine the osmolarity of the renal medulla, the osmolarity in the renal medulla decreases rapidly with furosemide. As a result, water no longer has the incentive to leave the tubular lumen and is consequently excreted in greater amounts. Clinically, furosemide is therefore used, for example, for the removal of edema. However, it should be noted that electrolytes such as sodium and potassium are also excreted in greater amounts.

> [!NOTE] Bartter syndrome
> The Bartter syndrome is a very rare hereditary disease in which the function of the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter can also be disturbed. Since sodium, potassium, and chloride are not reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, there is an electrolyte surplus in the distal tubule. This leads to an aldosterone-dependent reabsorption of Na+ in exchange for K+ or H+ in the late distal tubule. K+ and H+ are instead excreted in increased amounts, resulting in hypokalemic alkalosis.

## Distal Nephron

The distal nephron anatomically consists of the distal tubule, the connecting tubule, and the collecting duct. Here, the fine-tuning of urine composition takes place, especially regarding the concentration of electrolytes as well as osmolarity - these are particularly influenced by hormones. The distal nephron is divided into (1) the early distal tubule and (2) the late distal tubule and the collecting duct.

### Early Distal Tubule

- Important Transporters (luminal)
    - Na+/Cl--Cotransporter
        - Transport: Transports a sodium ion and a chloride ion into the tubular cell; is induced by aldosterone
        - Mechanism: Secondary active transport
    - Ca2+-channel (ECaC)
        - Transport: Transports a calcium ion into the tubule cell
        - Mechanism: Tertiary-active transport
            - First, calcium is transported basolaterally into the renal interstitium via a secondary active 3 Na+/Ca2+ antiport.
            - The uptake of calcium into the tubular cell occurs passively through a tertiary-active transport due to the established calcium concentration gradient.
## Distal Convoluted Tubule and Collecting Duct

In the distal tubule and collecting duct, there are two different cell types: the principal cells and the intercalated cells. These have different transporters.

- Principal cells
    - Epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC): Sodium reabsorption; is stimulated by aldosterone
    - K+ channels (ROMK): K+ flows out of the cell into the lumen, stimulated by aldosterone.
    - Aquaporin-2 channels: Water reabsorption
- Switching cells
    - Switch cells type A: Secrete H+
        - Transporter: H+/K+-ATPase or H+-ATPase
    - Type B cells: Secrete HCO3-
        - Transporter: Cl-/HCO3--Transporter

> [!NOTE]
> The Na+/Cl- cotransporter and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are incorporated into the tubule cells of the distal nephron in an aldosterone-dependent manner!

> [!NOTE] Amiloride
> The potassium-sparing diuretic Amiloride is often used in chronic edema. It blocks the luminal sodium channel in the distal tubule and collecting duct. The luminal effect occurs particularly quickly because Amiloride rapidly reaches the site of action through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. More sodium is excreted, which carries water with it. A notable side effect to be aware of is hyperkalemia.

> [!NOTE] Diabetes insipidus
> In diabetes insipidus, the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine is reduced. A distinction is made between a central and a renal form of diabetes insipidus. The cause of the most common central form is a deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH), while the rare renal form is due to a lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. The latter can be explained by a defect in the V2 receptors. Large amounts of dilute urine are excreted (polyuria), which causes the patients to experience a compulsive thirst to compensate for the fluid loss (polydipsia). The urge to urinate that also occurs at night (nocturia) leads to sleep deprivation and increased daytime fatigue.

> [!NOTE] Spironolactone
> Aldosterone antagonists (such as spironolactone) block the intracellular aldosterone receptor. The synthesis of the two aldosterone-induced transport proteins (luminal ENaC and the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase) is inhibited, thereby nullifying the effects of aldosterone. Sodium is excreted more and potassium is retained more. Clinically, spironolactone is primarily used in the treatment of heart failure and edema. In laboratory tests, the serum potassium level must be regularly monitored during treatment with aldosterone antagonists to prevent the development of hyperkalemia, which can cause dangerous heart rhythm disturbances.

### Urine Concentration

The osmolarity of the renal interstitium increases from 290 mosmol/L in the renal cortex to a maximum of 1400 mosmol/L at the tip of the papilla (the so-called corticomedullary osmolarity gradient). The basis for the development of this gradient is the countercurrent principle. The recycling of urea also plays an important role.

### Fundamental Principles of Urine Concentration

- Countercurrent principle of the kidney: Most important mechanism of renal urine concentration
    - Process
        - Active sodium reabsorption in the ascending part of the Henle loop via Na+/K+/2Cl--transporter
        - Water cannot flow because the rising part is impermeable to water.
        - Renal interstitium becomes hyperosmolar
        - The descending part of the Henle loop (which passes through the hyperosmolar interstitium) is permeable to water.
        - Due to the large osmolarity gradient between the descending part and the interstitium, water is removed from the descending part through reabsorption.
        - Result: Energy-efficient urine concentration
- Urea recycling: Urea is initially freely filtered and subsequently both reabsorbed and secreted.
    - Process
        - Proximal Nephron: Reabsorption of approximately 50% of urea (free diffusion from the tubule into the interstitium)
        - Distal Nephron: Mostly impermeable to urea
            - Collector pipe
                - ADH mediates the insertion and activation of Urea Transporter 1 (UT-1) in the luminal membrane.
                - Due to the high urea concentration in the lumen, urea is now reabsorbed into the inner medulla along its chemical gradient.
                - Since urea is only reabsorbed in the medullary part of the collecting duct, it accumulates in the renal medulla.
                - Accumulated urea removes water from the descending limb of the Henle loop, thus contributing to the concentration of urine in the descending limb of the Henle loop.
        - Thinner part of the Henle loop: Urea re-enters the tubular lumen via Urea Transporter 2 (UT2)

> [!NOTE]
> The low blood flow of the renal medulla serves to maintain the osmotic gradient for urine concentration. With an increase in blood pressure, there is increased medullary blood flow, leading to the washing out of this gradient. The result is an increased diuresis (so-called "pressure diuresis").

### Process of Urine Concentration

1. Proximal Nephron
    - Resorption of a large part of the filtered substances, e.g. glucose, amino acids, phosphate in symport with sodium
    - The tubular lumen is negatively charged compared to the interstitium (lumen-negative transepithelial potential)
    - The interstitium becomes hyperosmolar compared to the tubular lumen.
    - Due to the lumen-negative transepithelial potential, chloride ions now flow into the interstitium.
2. Descending part of the Henle loop
    - Practically no active transporters
    - Diffusion of water into the interstitium (mediated by the countercurrent principle of the kidney)
    - Further withdrawal of water through urea accumulated in the renal medulla
    - Stark hyperosmolar urine reaches the ascending part of the loop of Henle.
3. Ascending limb of the Henle loop
    - Sodium, potassium, and chloride are absorbed by means of a secondary active transporter, but this section is impermeable to water.
    - The interstitium becomes hyperosmolar compared to the tubular lumen.
    - The tubular lumen becomes positively charged in relation to the interstitium (lumen-positive transepithelial potential) and drives cations (potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium) into the interstitium.
4. Distal Nephron (Collecting Duct)
    - Through the ADH-dependent incorporation of aquaporins, it becomes permeable to water again.
    - Water can flow into the hyperosmolar interstitium.

> [!NOTE]
> Using the countercurrent principle and urea recycling, a corticomedullary osmolarity gradient is established in the loop of Henle. In the collecting duct, this gradient is then utilized to reabsorb water: urine is thus highly concentrated!

> [!NOTE]
> The countercurrent principle also affects the oxygen content of the interstitium: The erythrocytes in the descending vasa recta release oxygen to the deoxygenated erythrocytes of the ascending vasa recta, so that the renal medulla is supplied with less oxygen than the cortex!

## Overview: Absorption and Secretion of Individual Substances

### Sodium Resorption

The sodium filtered in the glomerulus is reabsorbed by about 99%.

- General Principle: The Na+/K+-ATPase (basolateral) pumps sodium out of the cell (using 1 ATP, 3 Na+ are exchanged for 2 K+) → Sodium gradient is created → Sodium ions are drawn from the tubular lumen into the tubular cells (secondary active transport)
- Resorption mechanisms
    - Proximal Tubule
        - Na+-symporter with carbohydrates, amino acids, phosphate
        - Na+/H+-antiporter
        - Solvent Drag
    - Thin descending and thin ascending part of the Henle loop (intermediate tubule)
        - Paracellular resorption (no active sodium resorption!)
    - Thick, ascending part of the Henle loop (Pars recta of the distal tubule)
        - Na+/K+/2Cl--Transporter
    - Distal tubule, convoluted part
        - NaCl Cotransporter
    - Connector and collector pipe
        - Epithelial Na+ Channels (ENaC)

> [!NOTE]
> The sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct via ENaC is aldosterone-dependent and is always accompanied by increased potassium secretion!

### Potassium Reabsorption and Potassium Secretion

- Potassium reabsorption: About 90% of the potassium filtered in the glomerulus is reabsorbed.
    - Proximal Tubule: Solvent Drag
    - Thick, ascending part of the Henle loop: Na+-K+-2Cl--transporter
- Potassium secretion
    - Collecting duct: K+-channels

> [!NOTE]
> The potassium channels in the collecting duct are functionally coupled to the ENaC (Epithelial Sodium Channels) of the collecting duct. An increased sodium reabsorption through the ENaC is therefore always accompanied by an increased potassium secretion!

### Chloride Resorption

Approximately 99% of the chloride filtered in the glomerulus is reabsorbed. Chloride reabsorption is closely linked to sodium reabsorption.

- Proximal Tubule: Solvent Drag
- Thin, ascending part of the Henle loop: Passive reabsorption
- Thick ascending limb of the Henle loop: Na+-K+-2Cl--transporter
- Distal tubule, convoluted part: NaCl co-transporter

### Calcium Resorption

Approximately 95% of the calcium filtered in the glomerulus is reabsorbed.

- Proximal Tubule: Paracellular (Solvent Drag)
- Ascending part of the Henle loop: Paracellular
- Distal tubule, convoluted part: ECaC (Epithelial calcium channels)

### Magnesium Resorption

Approximately 95% of the magnesium filtered in the glomerulus is reabsorbed.

- Proximal Tubule: Solvent Drag
- Thick, ascending part of the Henle loop: Paracellular (The driving force for this is the lumen-positive transepithelial potential generated by the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporter)

### Proton secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption

For renal proton secretion, the phosphate and ammonium systems are of particular importance. About half of the protons are secreted as free protons into the tubular lumen and are mainly bound there by the phosphate buffer. The other half enters the tubular lumen as ammonium ions (NH4+). Through the direct excretion of ammonium, protons are excreted on one hand, while on the other hand, bicarbonate is conserved compared to ammonia excretion via the urea cycle (indirect buffering effect).

#### Proton secretion

- Proximal Tubule
    - Na+/H+-antiporter: The proton secretion through this transporter is closely linked to bicarbonate reabsorption.
        1. H+ enters the tubular lumen via the Na+/H+ antiporter and combines there with HCO3- to form carbonic acid (H2CO3)
        2. The carbonic anhydrase is located in the brush border, which splits H2CO3 into H2O and CO2.
        3. CO2 is absorbed and rehydrated to H2CO3 by a cytosolic carbonic anhydrase.
        4. H2CO3 spontaneously decomposes into H+ and HCO3-
        5. H+ is now transported back into the tubular lumen via the Na+/H+ antiporter.
        6. HCO3- exits the cell basolaterally via the Na+/3HCO3- symporter.
- Collection tube: Depending on the pH level of the blood, one of the two types of switch cells that can be transformed into one another dominates here.
    - Type A switching cells
        - H+-ATPase (primary-active): Pumps protons into the tubular lumen
    - Type B switch cells
        - Cl-/HCO3--Antiporter: Promotes bicarbonate exchange with chloride into the tubular lumen

#### Binding of Protons in Urine

- Ammonium system: Excretion of protons bound to ammonium ions (NH4+): see secretion of urea compounds and the role of the liver in pH regulation.
- Secretion of phosphate: PO43- is freely filtered at the glomerulus and combines in the tubular lumen with one or two H+ ions (to HPO42- or H2PO4‑)

> [!NOTE]
> Protons are buffered by the phosphate buffer on one hand, and on the other hand, they can be excreted in the form of NH4+.

### Resorption of Proteins and Amino Acids

Proteins and amino acids are almost completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.

- Free amino acids: Via a Na+-symporter
- Dipeptide, Oligopeptide, Polypeptide: Are split by peptidases in the brush border.
    - Uptake either via endocytosis or through a proton symporter

### Carbohydrate Absorption

- Glucose reabsorption: Normally, all glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. For this, there are two sodium-coupled transporters (SGLT = Sodium dependent glucose transporter) available, which differ in their affinity.
    - SGLT2: Is increasingly located at the beginning of the proximal tubule
        - Resorbs a molecule of glucose with a molecule of sodium (Na+-/glucose symporter)
        - High capacity, but low affinity
    - SGLT1: Is increasingly located at the end of the proximal tubule
        - Absorbs a molecule of glucose with two molecules of sodium (2Na+-/glucose symporter)
        - Low capacity, but high affinity
    - Fructose absorption: GLUT5 (sodium-independent)
    - Galactoseresorption: Also SGLT1

> [!NOTE]
> At a concentration of 10mmol/l in the primary urine, the transport capacity of the glucose transporters is exceeded, so glucose is excreted with the urine. This value is therefore referred to as the renal threshold for glucose!

### Water Resorption

The water reabsorption occurs passively and can be strongly modulated (e.g., via ADH). This makes variable excretion of water possible (urine concentration).

- Proximal Tubule
    - Aquaporin 1 (AQP1)
    - Paracellular
- Thin, descending limb of the Henle loop: Aquaporin 1 (AQP1)
- Ascending limb of the Henle loop: Impermeable to water
- Distal tubule: Paracellular
- Collecting duct: Aquaporin 2 (AQP2)
    - Here the final urine osmolarity is established.

> [!NOTE]
> The incorporation of AQP2 into the tubular cells of the collecting duct occurs in an ADH-dependent manner!

### Secretion of Excretory Substances

- Ammonia excretion: Either converted into urea in the liver during the urea cycle using bicarbonate or fixed in glutamine.
    - In the cells of the proximal tubule, a total of two ammonium ions (NH4+) are released from glutamine.
        - Glutaminase: Glutamine → Glutamate + NH4+
        - Glutamate Dehydrogenase: Glutamate → α-Ketoglutarate + NH4+
    - NH4+ dissociates to NH3 + H+ → the uncharged NH3 can diffuse into the tubular lumen and H+ enters the lumen via active secretion → in the lumen, NH3 reacts with H+ to form NH4+ again.
    - NH4+ is polar and therefore cannot diffuse back into the cell → NH4+ is excreted with the urine
        - The Na+-K+-2Cl--transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle can reabsorb NH4+ instead of K+ → part of the NH4+ moves from the tubular lumen back into the renal medulla → high concentration of NH4+ in the renal medulla → NH4+ ⇄ NH3 and H+ → diffusion of NH3 along the concentration gradient into the lumen of the collecting duct, active secretion of H+-ions into the collecting duct → NH4+ is excreted with the urine
    - The excretion of NH4+ via glutamine results in the excretion of protons on one hand, while on the other hand, compared to the excretion of ammonia (NH3) through the urea cycle, bicarbonate is conserved. This bicarbonate is thus available as a buffer (indirect buffering effect of the ammonium system, see also The Role of the Liver in pH Regulation).
- Urea excretion
    - Urea is freely filtered and 50% is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
    - A portion of the urea undergoes urea recycling, which is crucial for the establishment of the corticomedullary osmolarity gradient.
- Uric acid excretion
    - Uric acid is initially almost completely reabsorbed as urate in the proximal tubule; only towards the end of the proximal tubule is about 10% secreted again, which is then excreted.
- Creatinine excretion
    - Creatinine is freely filtered, slightly secreted, and not reabsorbed.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Tubular Transport Processes
### The individual nephron sections

In which tubular section is the largest proportion of bicarbonate reabsorbed?  
- In the proximal tubule, 95% of the bicarbonate is reabsorbed back into the blood due to bulk reabsorption.  
Explain the mechanism by which substances such as phosphate, glucose, and amino acids are reabsorbed from the primary urine into the cell in the proximal tubule!  
- In the (early) proximal tubule, the reabsorption of most substances from the primary urine is coupled to sodium reabsorption. The necessary steep sodium gradient is generated by a basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase. Specific transporters of the luminal cell membrane can then take up phosphate, glucose, and amino acids via a Na+-symport.  
How does bicarbonate move from the proximal tubular lumen into the interstitium? What special feature does the basolateral transport involved have?  
- Filtered bicarbonate reacts with H+ ions in the tubular lumen to form CO2. This reaction is accelerated by the apical carbonic anhydrase. CO2 can diffuse into the cell and there, with the help of another carbonic anhydrase, be converted back into H+ and HCO3-. HCO3- then leaves the cell into the interstitium via a basolateral Na+/3HCO3- symport. The driving force for this symport is the cell membrane potential of the tubular cell, which moves sodium and bicarbonate against their chemical gradients out of the cell.  
What transport processes occur in the intermediate tubule?  
- In the so-called intermediate tubule (= thin descending and ascending limbs of the loop of Henle), hardly any active transport processes take place. Water reabsorption through aquaporin-1 channels (AQP1) is found only in the descending intermediate tubule – the ascending tubule is impermeable to water.  
What is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of the Henle loop and how does this occur?  
- In the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, transcellular reabsorption occurs; the key transporter here is the Na+/K+/2Cl--transporter (NKCC2). Sodium and chloride leave the cell after uptake via basal channels, while potassium returns to the tubular lumen through an apical channel (ROMK). This creates a positive net charge in the tubular lumen, which can be used to drive paracellular reabsorption of cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+). For water, however, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is nearly impermeable.  
How does furosemide work and what should one take into consideration because of that?  
- The loop diuretic furosemide inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl--cotransporter in the loop of Henle by binding to it on the luminal side. Due to the reduced reabsorption of electrolytes, the osmolarity in the renal medulla quickly decreases – thus water has no tendency to leave the tubular lumen and is increasingly excreted. However, it must be considered that sodium and potassium are also increasingly excreted.  
Which transporters or channels are aldosterone-dependent in the tubular cells of the distal nephron?  
- The luminal Na+/Cl--cotransporter and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are incorporated into the tubular cells of the distal nephron in an aldosterone-dependent manner.  
What do pharmacological inhibitors of the so-called ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel) achieve, and what advantage do they have over other diuretics?  
- The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is located on the luminal membrane of the late distal tubule and the collecting ducts. Inhibitors of this channel (e.g., amiloride) prevent the reabsorption of sodium and water here. In contrast to other diuretics (e.g., loop diuretics), they do not lead to potassium loss; for this reason, this drug group is also called potassium-sparing diuretics.  
### Urine Concentration

What function do the urea transporters type 1 and 2 each have, and what role does ADH play?  
- The urea transporters (UT) allow passive transport of urea. UT-2 is located in the luminal membrane in the ascending part of the loop of Henle and mediates the transport of urea from the cell into the tubular lumen. UT-1 is expressed in the collecting duct, where it allows urea to return to the interstitium. ADH is released during fluid deficiency and causes, among other effects, increased insertion of UT-1. The resulting increased concentration of urea in the interstitium causes enhanced water reabsorption.  
What role do the transport processes in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle play in the corticomedullary osmolarity gradient?  
- The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is largely impermeable to water but reabsorbs electrolytes via secondary active transporters. This renders the interstitium hyperosmolar compared to the tubular lumen. These transport processes thus contribute to the generation of the corticomedullary osmolarity gradient, which enables water reabsorption in the descending part of the loop of Henle.  
### Resorption and secretion of individual substances

The urine concentration of which ion besides sodium is influenced by the activity of ENaC?  
- Sodium reabsorption in the late distal tubule and collecting ducts occurs via ENaC (epithelial sodium channels). If the activity of the channels is increased, more sodium ions are taken up into the tubular cell, making its charge more positive. This causes the likewise positively charged potassium ions to leave the cell more into the tubular lumen. Therefore, increased activity of ENaC is always associated with increased potassium secretion.  
How does renal magnesium reabsorption occur?  
- Renal magnesium reabsorption occurs mainly in the loop of Henle and to a lesser extent in the proximal tubule. In the proximal tubule, this occurs paracellularly via solvent drag; in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the transport also occurs paracellularly with the help of the lumen-positive transepithelial potential generated by the Na+/K+/2Cl--transporter.  
How does renal calcium reabsorption occur?  
- Calcium reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and the distal tubule. In the proximal tubule, calcium ions are reabsorbed paracellularly via solvent drag; in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the transport also occurs paracellularly with the help of the lumen-positive transepithelial potential generated by the Na+/K+/2Cl--transporter. In the distal tubule, reabsorption occurs via tertiary active transport. A calcium concentration gradient is first established using a basolateral secondary active 3 Na+/Ca2+ antiport. Calcium then follows the gradient passively via luminal Ca2+ channels (ECaC).  
What are the consequences of inhibiting carbonic anhydrases in the proximal tubule?  
- The carbonic anhydrases of the proximal tubule catalyze the conversion of bicarbonate to CO2 and H2O and thus play a crucial role in bicarbonate reabsorption and proton secretion. If they are inhibited, bicarbonate excretion is increased, whereas proton excretion is decreased – resulting in a metabolic acidosis.  
How does renal reabsorption of peptides occur?  
- Peptides are first cleaved by peptidases in the brush border of the proximal tubule and then taken up into the cell either by endocytosis or via proton symport.  
What is referred to as the so-called renal threshold for glucose and where is it located?  
- Under physiological conditions, glucose is already completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule via specific transporters. If blood glucose concentration is increased (e.g., due to diabetes mellitus), more glucose also appears in the primary urine. When the concentration in the primary urine exceeds a certain value – the so-called renal threshold – the transport capacity of the glucose transporters is exceeded and glucose is excreted in the urine. This value lies at approximately 10 mmol/L.  
What effect does ADH have on the collecting duct epithelium?  
- ADH is released more during fluid deficiency and stimulates in the collecting ducts the insertion of aquaporins type 2 (AQP2) into the apical membrane. This causes increased water reabsorption and concentration of the urine.  
What is the fractional excretion of creatinine and urea?  
- Fractional excretion describes the amount of a molecule or ion excreted by the kidney relative to its glomerular filtered amount. Since creatinine is freely filtered in the kidney and only marginally secreted and not reabsorbed, its fractional excretion is nearly 100%. Approximately 50% of filtered urea is excreted.
