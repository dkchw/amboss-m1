# Vascular Supply of the Brain
## Summary

The arteries of the brain supply it with oxygen and other essential nutrients. They are all fed by the vertebral arteries and internal carotid arteries, which in turn form an arterial circle around the infundibulum – the so-called cerebral arterial circle (also known as Circle of Willis). This arterial circle ensures that areas of the brain can still receive blood supply through collateral arteries – so-called anastomoses – in the event of a vessel occlusion. However, whether an occlusion can be compensated depends heavily on the size of the affected artery. Additionally, from the cerebral arterial circle, three major cerebral arteries (anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery) branch off to supply the forebrain and midbrain. If there is a disturbance in blood flow (ischemic stroke) due to vessel occlusions or bleeding that cannot be compensated, this can lead to irreversible damage within minutes. Therefore, understanding the supply areas is important to be able to associate symptoms of dysfunction with a cerebral artery.

The veins of the brain collect in large reservoirs, the sinuses of the dura mater, from where the blood subsequently drains into the heart or into the spinal veins.
## Cerebral arterial circle (Willis circle)

### Cerebral Arterial Circle

The circulus arteriosus cerebri is supplied by two large, paired arteries and forms a closed arterial circle around the pituitary stalk that supplies the entire brain. The blood for the anterior sections is provided by the two internal carotid arteries, while that for the posterior sections comes from the two vertebral arteries. Via connecting arteries, both supplying arteries are interconnected, forming a circulation. This circulation can serve as a collateral circulation in the event of a vessel occlusion.

The arrangement of the cerebral arterial circle can vary significantly from person to person, but this usually has no adverse effects on the arterial supply of the brain. Functional details about brain metabolism are presented in exercise physiology (see: Exercise Physiology and Aging).

- Supplying Arteries
    - A. carotis interna + branches: Supply the anterior portion
    - A. vertebralis + branches: Feed the posterior part

#### Internal carotid artery

The internal carotid artery branches off from the common carotid artery. It is paired and runs on the left and right sides of the neck as the left internal carotid artery and the right internal carotid artery.

- Origin: Branch of the A. carotis communis
- Course: According to its course, it can be divided into four sections from caudal to cranial.
    - Pars cervicalis: Runs from the origin at the A. carotis communis to the base of the skull

#### Vertebral artery

The vertebral artery branches off from the subclavian artery. It is paired and runs on the left and right sides along the cervical spine as the left vertebral artery and the right vertebral artery. Together with the basilar artery, it forms the so-called vertebrobasilar area.

- Origin: 1. Branch of the A. subclavia
- Progress
    - The spine reaches just below the 6th cervical vertebra and continues cranially within the transverse foramina of the 6th to 1st cervical vertebra
        - At the level of each cervical vertebral body, branches are given off to the surrounding musculature and to the spinal cord
    - Entry into the skull through the foramen magnum
    - Submission of
        - A. spinalis anterior
        - A. inferior posterior cerebelli (PICA)
    - The right and left A. vertebralis unite to form the A. basilaris at the level of the Pons
        - Submission of

                - A. labyrinth
            - Aa. bridge
            - A. superior cerebelli

> [!NOTE] Intracerebral Aneurysms
> In the arteries of the cerebral arterial circle (also known as the basal cerebral arteries or brain base arteries), wall bulges, known as aneurysms, are often found. These aneurysms can rupture even in young individuals, leading to bleeding in the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), which can be evidenced among other things by the presence of blood in the cerebrospinal fluid. Aneurysms are commonly located in the anterior part of the circle of Willis (e.g., at the anterior communicating artery). A typical clinical sign is a very severe, suddenly occurring headache (“thunderclap headache”). For the differentiation of the various types of aneurysms, see: aneurysm.

## The major cerebral arteries: Anterior cerebral artery, Middle cerebral artery, Posterior cerebral artery

The cerebrum and diencephalon are supplied by three major arteries that are also part of the circulus arteriosus cerebri: anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior cerebral artery. Their supply areas do not overlap, so an acute occlusion can lead to symptoms that are usually clearly attributable to a specific artery.
## Anterior cerebral artery

The anterior cerebral artery is the terminal branch of the internal carotid artery. Through the branching of the anterior communicating artery, it is divided into two parts: a precommunical segment and a postcommunical segment. The two sections are also referred to as the A1 and A2 segments.

- Origin: Only the A. carotis interna
- Course
    - Precommunical part, A1-Segment
        - Submission
            - Smaller branches to the cerebral and midbrain areas
            - The A. communicans anterior
    - Post-communical part, A2-Segment
        - Submission of
            - A. frontobasalis
            - A. centralis longa
        - Continuation into the interhemispheric fissure and towards the corpus callosum
        - There, a bifurcation into its 2 main branches
            - A. pericallosa
            - A. callosomarginalis
- Supply area
    - Frontal Lobe
        - Prefrontal Cortex
        - Premotor Cortex
    - Parietal Lobe
    - Septum

|Artery|Branches|Supply Area|
|---|---|---|
|A. cerebri anterior|- Anterior medial central arteries<br>- Distal medial striatal artery (recurrent artery, Heubner artery, long central artery)|- Anterior commissure<br>- Internal capsule<br>- Striatum<br>- Globus pallidus<br>- Caudate nucleus|
|- A. anterior communicating |- Optic chiasm<br>- Infundibulum<br>- Hypothalamus|
|- A. frontobasalis|- Frontal lobe|
|- A. pericallosa<br>- A. callosomarginalis|- Frontal lobe (including Marginal edge)<br>- Parietal lobe<br>- Cingulate gyrus<br>- Superior frontal gyrus<br>- Middle frontal gyrus<br>- Pre- and postcentral gyrus<br>- Corpus callosum|

> [!NOTE] Anterior Myocardial Infarction
> A blockage of the A. cerebri anterior is rather rare (about 5% of all cerebral infarcts). Since the supply area of the A. cerebri anterior includes both the pre- and postcentral gyrus in the region of the marginal gyrus, an anterior infarct leads to a leg-dominant sensorimotor hemiparesis contralateral to the infarct. Additionally, more nonspecific symptoms such as apathy may occur.

### Middle cerebral artery

The middle cerebral artery is a terminal branch of the internal carotid artery and continues its course after the branching of the anterior cerebral artery. It is divided into two parts: a sphenoidal part (up to the lateral fossa) and an insular part (from the lateral fossa). The two sections are also referred to as the M1 and M2 segments.

- Origin: Only the A. carotis interna
- Course
    - Sphenoid part, M1 segment: Runs between temporal lobe and insula cortex into the lateral fossa
        - Arteries: A. central anterolateral (also called A. lenticulostriatal) (supply parts of the internal capsule)
    - Insular part, M2 segment: In the lateral sulcus of the cerebrum branching into its terminal branches
        - Lower cortical terminal branches
        - Superior cortical terminal branches
- Supply area
    - Frontal Lobe
        - Premotor Cortex
        - Motor Cortex
        - Motor Speech Center (Broca Area)
        - Frontal Eye Center
    - Parietal Lobe
        - Primary and secondary somatosensory cortex
        - Angular gyrus
    - Temporal Lobe
        - Sensory Language Center (Wernicke Area)

|Artery|Branches|Supply Area|
|---|---|---|
|A. middle cerebral|- Anterolateral central arteries|- Striatum<br>- Pallidum<br>- Internal capsule<br>- Thalamus (small part)|
|- Rr. terminalis corticales inferiores<br>    - A. temporooccipitalis<br>    - Additional small branches to the temporal lobe|- temporal lobe|
|- Superior cortical terminal branches<br>    - Frontal basal artery lateral<br>    - Prefrontal artery<br>    - Artery of the precentral sulcus<br>    - Artery of the central sulcus<br>    - Anterior and posterior parietal arteries<br>    - Angular gyrus artery|- Frontal lobe<br>- Parietal lobe|

> [!NOTE] Mediainfarkt
> There are two forms of strokes: the ischemic stroke due to reduced blood flow and the hemorrhagic stroke due to bleeding. With about 80-85%, the ischemic stroke is the significantly more common form. The symptoms depend on the area with reduced blood supply and can therefore provide insights into which artery is affected. In the case of an occlusion of the A. cerebri media, there is an arm and facial weakness affecting the contralateral side of the body. In the acute phase following larger media infarcts, a so-called hemineglect is also often observed; a disturbance of attention or consciousness, where the contralateral space or body side to the brain lesion is ignored despite intact primary sensory and motor function on that side. A patient with hemineglect due to a right-sided infarct would, for example, ignore voices coming from the left side of space and instead turn their head to the right, as they associate the voices from that side.

### Posterior cerebral artery

The posterior cerebral artery arises from the bifurcation of the basilar artery, which originates from the vertebral artery. In its course, two sections or 4 segments are distinguished.

- Origin: Branch of the A. basilaris
- Special feature: Runs shortly after its origin directly above the N. oculomotorius
- Course
    - Precommunical part, P1-Segment
        - Submission of
            - A. communicans posterior
            - Aa. posteromedial and posterolateral centrales
    - Post-communicative phase, Segments P2–P4
        - P2-Segment: Extension between midbrain and temporal lobe backward around the brainstem to the medial hemisphere side
            - Branches: Aa. chorioideae posteriores medialis et lateralis
        - On the medial hemisphere, it gives off its two main branches and additional branches at the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus to supply the parietal and occipital lobes.
            - P3-Segment: A. occipitalis lateral (lateral main branch)
            - P4-Segment: A. occipitalis medial (medial main branch)
                - A. parietooccipitalis
                - A. calcarina
- Supply area
    - Temporal Lobe
    - Okzipital Lobe
    - Mesencephalon

|Artery|Branches|Supply Area|
|---|---|---|
||- A. communicans posterior|- s. Internal carotid artery|
|A. posterior cerebri|- Posteromedial and posterolateral central arteries|- Mesencephalon<br>- Diencephalon|
|- Aa. chorioideae posteriores mediales et laterales|- Choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle and the III ventricle<br>- Pineal gland<br>- Mesencephalon<br>- Diencephalon|
|- Additional small branches|- Temporal lobe<br>- Medial geniculate body<br>- Lateral geniculate body<br>- Thalamus<br>- Parahippocampal gyrus<br>- Hippocampus<br>- Corpus callosum|

|- A. occipitalis medialis<br>    - A. parietooccipitalis<br>    - A. calcarina|- (Pre‑)Cuneus<br>- Area striata (primary visual cortex)|

### Veins of the Brain

One distinguishes between the veins of the brain based on their location, the superficial brain veins from the deep brain veins. All veins of the brain converge in large venous blood conduits, the sinuses of the dura mater. From there, the blood mostly flows through the internal jugular vein and the superior vena cava to the heart. Another, smaller part drains from the sinuses via the spinal veins and the emissary veins.

> [!NOTE]
> Brain veins have no valves and no muscle tissue in the vessel wall!

### Superficial Brain Veins (Venae superficiales cerebri)

The superficial brain veins drain venous blood from the outermost layer of the brain – the cortex and the white matter – and can be divided into three groups: upper, middle, and lower cerebral veins. Through the so-called bridging veins, the superficial brain veins are connected to the dural sinuses.

- Superior Veins (Vv. superiores cerebri): 8–12 Veins for each hemisphere
    - Input: Collecting blood from the upper lateral and medial hemisphere (especially the frontal and parietal lobes)
    - Drainage: Into the superior sagittal sinus
- Middle vein (V. cerebri media superficialis): Consists of the superior anastomotic vein (Trolard-vein) and the inferior anastomotic vein (Labbé-vein).
    - Inflow: Collects blood from the area around the lateral sulcus
    - Drainage: In the sphenoparietal sinus
- Lower veins (Vv. inferiores cerebri)
    - Influx: Collection of blood of the basal hemisphere (particularly temporal and occipital lobes)
    - Outflow: Mostly into the transverse sinus
- Bridging veins: Connect the superficial cerebral veins with the dural sinuses

> [!NOTE] Subdural hematoma  
> In the context of trauma, there can be a rupture of the bridging veins. The escaping blood then spills into the subdural space, which is the space between the dura mater and arachnoid. After a traumatic brain injury, a subdural hematoma can take an acute course, whereas after a minor trauma it can take a chronic course (often over weeks) and often presents with nonspecific neurological symptoms in the latter case. A special case is the so-called Shaken Baby Syndrome, in which shaking a baby/toddler leads to a rupture of the bridging veins (known as “shaking trauma”).

### Deep Cerebral Veins (Venae profundae cerebri)

The deep brain veins drain blood from the deeper structures in the brain such as the diencephalon and other subcortical areas. All deep brain veins drain either into the V. basalis or the V. interna cerebri. These two large veins later unite to form the V. magna cerebri (Vein of Galen).

- Basal vein: Unites the anterior cerebral vein and the deep middle vein.
    - Inflow: Collects blood from the structures located in the forebrain
    - Outflow: Into the V. magna cerebri
- Internal cerebral vein
    - United
        - V. chorioidea superior
        - V. septi pellucidi
        - V. thalamostriata superior drains blood from pallidum, striatum, and parts of the thalamus and also separates the telencephalon from the diencephalon.
    - Inflow: Collects blood from the basal ganglia and the medullary storage
    - Outflow: Into the V. magna cerebri
- V. magna cerebri (V. Galeni, Galen-Vene): Unites V. basalis and V. interna cerebri
    - Outflow: Basal Vein, Internal Cerebral Vein
    - Drainage: Into the straight sinus

> [!NOTE]
> The superficial veins drain directly into the sinuses of the dura mater, while the deep veins flow through the great cerebral vein into the rectus sinus!

### Durale Sinus (Dural Sinus)

The dural sinuses are a type of reservoir where the blood from smaller veins of the brain, the meninges, and the orbital cavity is collected and transported away. The sinuses are located in the space between two layers of dura mater – the dural duplications – and drain into the internal jugular vein.

|Dura mater sinus|Inflow|Outflow|Characteristics|
|---|---|---|---|
|Superior sagittal sinus|- Superior cerebral veins|- Confluence of sinuses|- Largest dural sinus<br>- Course along the upper edge of the falx cerebri|
|Inferior sagittal sinus|- Small veins from the center of the brain|- Rectus sinus (together with great cerebral vein)|- Course along the lower edge of the falx cerebri|
|Straight sinus|- Great cerebral vein<br>- Inferior sagittal sinus|- Confluence of sinuses||
|Marginal sinus|- Basilar plexus<br>- Internal vertebral venous plexus|- Occipital sinus||
|Occipital sinus|- Marginal sinus|- Confluence of sinuses||
|Transverse sinus|- Confluence of sinuses|- Right and left sigmoid sinus||
|Sigmoid sinus|- Transverse sinus|- Internal jugular vein|- Close proximity relationship to the Mastoid cells|
|Sphenoparietal sinus|- Superficial middle cerebral vein|- Cavernous sinus||
|Cavernous sinus|- Sphenoparietal sinus<br>- Basal cerebral veins<br>- Superior ophthalmic vein|- Superior petrosal sinus → Sigmoid sinus<br>- Inferior petrosal sinus → Internal jugular vein|- Paired venous cavity surrounding the pituitary gland<br>- Passing through the cavernous sinus:<br>    - Internal carotid artery<br>    - Abducens nerve<br>- Running in the wall of the cavernous sinus:<br>    - Oculomotor nerve (CN III)<br>    - Trochlear nerve (CN IV)<br>    - Ophthalmic nerve (V1)<br>    - Maxillary nerve (V2)|
|Superior petrosal sinus|- Cavernous sinus|- Sigmoid sinus||
|Inferior petrosal sinus|- Cavernous sinus|- Internal jugular vein||

> [!NOTE] Septicaemic Cavernous-sinus-Thrombosis  
> A septic cavernous sinus thrombosis occurs when a pathogen enters the sinus from adjacent structures or from draining veins. Due to the topographical proximity of the cavernous sinus to the paranasal sinuses, there is a risk that inflammation from a purulent sinusitis can break through the bony wall of the sinus and into the cavernous sinus. Additionally, pathogens from the veins of the face can enter the cavernous sinus and lead to a thrombosis. A typical case example of this is the manipulation of furuncles in the nasolabial triangle. This can then lead to damage to the conduits passing through the cavernous sinus and to a purulent meningitis. The cavernous sinus is also involved in other clinical conditions, see: cavernous sinus syndrome, cavernous sinus fistula.

## Review Questions on the Chapter on Vascular Supply of the Brain
### Cerebral Arterial Circle (Willis Circle)

In what sections is the internal carotid artery divided? And from which of these sections does the ophthalmic artery originate?
- The internal carotid artery supplies blood to the anterior part of the cerebral arterial circle (Circulus arteriosus cerebri). It has four sections in its course: the pars cervicalis (runs from the origin of the common carotid artery to the base of the skull), the pars petrosa (runs in the petrous part of the temporal bone in the base of the skull), the pars cavernosa (runs in the cavernous sinus), and finally the pars cerebralis (runs in the subarachnoid space until it splits into two branches). The ophthalmic artery originates from this last section.

Describe the course of the A. vertebralis and specifically address its relationship to the cervical spine! What two branches does it give off immediately after passing through the foramen magnum?
- The vertebral artery is the first branch of the subclavian artery and is paired. It typically reaches the spine just below the 6th cervical vertebra and then continues cranially within the transverse foramina. After entering the skull through the foramen magnum, it gives off the anterior spinal artery and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). The right and left vertebral arteries unite at the level of the pons to form the basilar artery.

What are intracerebral aneurysms and what symptoms do they cause when they rupture?
- Bulges of the vessel wall (so-called aneurysms) can also occur on arteries of the cerebral arterial circle (Circulus arteriosus cerebri). Their rupture leads to bleeding into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The classic symptom of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is a very severe, sudden headache ("thunderclap headache").

### The major cerebral arteries

Through which three major arteries is the supply to the cerebral cortex ensured?
- The cerebrum and diencephalon are supplied by three major arteries, which are also part of the cerebral arterial circle: anterior cerebral artery (A. cerebri anterior), middle cerebral artery (A. cerebri media), and posterior cerebral artery (A. cerebri posterior).

The branches of which vessel supply the cingulate gyrus and the frontal lobe? What deficits result from an occlusion of the trunk?
- The pericallosal artery and callosomarginal artery, branches of the anterior cerebral artery, supply the cingulate gyrus and frontal lobe (including the cortical margin). An occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery therefore also affects the precentral and postcentral gyri in the region of the cortical margin, which is why an anterior infarct leads to a leg-predominant sensorimotor hemiparesis contralateral to the infarct. Additionally, nonspecific symptoms such as motivational disturbances may occur.

The A. cerebri media is divided into two sections, and where do these roughly run?
- The middle cerebral artery is divided into two sections: a pars sphenoidalis (M1 segment) and a pars insularis (M2 segment). The M1 segment runs between the temporal lobe and insular cortex up to the lateral fissure. From here begins the M2 segment, which divides into terminal branches within the lateral cerebral sulcus.

How does a media infarction typically manifest clinically?
- An occlusion of the middle cerebral artery causes, among other things, an arm- and face-dominant paralysis of the contralateral side of the body.

What is meant by a hemineglect?
- Hemineglect is a disturbance of attention resulting from a brain lesion in which affected individuals ignore or neglect the space or body half contralateral to the lesion in their perception. A neglect often occurs in the acute phase after a large infarct of the middle cerebral artery.

Which major brain artery runs immediately above the N. oculomotorius?
- The posterior cerebral artery from the basilar artery runs shortly after its origin directly above the oculomotor nerve.

How is the striate area supplied with blood?
- The striate area (primary visual cortex) is mainly supplied by branches of the medial occipital artery from the posterior cerebral artery.

### Veins of the Brain

How can the superficial brain veins be classified and which area does each drain?
- The superficial brain veins drain the venous blood from the uppermost layer of the brain (cortex and white matter) and can be divided into three groups: superior, middle, and inferior cerebral veins. The superior veins (Vv. superiores cerebri) collect blood from the upper lateral and medial hemisphere. The middle vein (V. cerebri media superficialis) drains blood from the area around the lateral sulcus. The inferior veins (Vv. inferiores cerebri) finally receive inflow from the basal hemisphere (especially the temporal and occipital lobes).

Where does the blood from the superficial brain veins flow?
- The superficial brain veins are connected to the dural venous sinuses via so-called bridging veins. The superior veins drain their blood into the superior sagittal sinus, the middle veins into the sphenoparietal sinus, and the inferior veins mostly into the transverse sinus.

What causes a subdural hematoma and how does it manifest clinically in a chronic course?
- A subdural hemorrhage can arise from tearing of the bridging veins due to trauma. After a traumatic brain injury, a subdural hemorrhage can have an acute course; following a minor trauma, however, it can follow a chronic course. The latter often manifests through nonspecific neurological symptoms such as confusion or impaired vigilance.

What is referred to as the so-called Galen vein and where does it direct its blood?
- The great cerebral vein (V. magna cerebri, also called Galen vein) unites the basal vein and internal cerebral vein. It drains into the straight sinus.

Where are the inferior sagittal sinus and the sigmoid sinus located?
- The inferior sagittal sinus runs along the lower margin of the falx cerebri. The sigmoid sinus runs in close proximity to the mastoid air cells.

What inflows does the cavernous sinus have, and what conduction pathways run in its lumen?
- The inflows of the cavernous sinus include the sphenoparietal sinus, the basal brain veins, and the superior ophthalmic vein. Within its lumen run the internal carotid artery and the abducens nerve.
