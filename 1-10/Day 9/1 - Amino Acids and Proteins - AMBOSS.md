# Amino Acids and Proteins
## Summary

Proteins are one of the classes of substances that make up living organisms. They serve as important "building materials" for the formation of many cellular and extracellular structures in the body. For this purpose, they are particularly well-suited due to their diversity and adaptability. This results from their structure: Proteins are made up of long, unbranched, and mostly complexly folded chains of amino acids. A total of 21 different amino acids form the building blocks from which proteins are constructed. Depending on the chain length and combination of the individual amino acids, very different proteins are formed, the number of which is virtually limitless.

Amino acids (or amino carboxylic acids) are organic molecules that contain both an amino group and a carboxyl group. The 21 amino acids that make up proteins (known as proteinogenic amino acids) have these two groups attached to the α-C atom and are therefore also referred to as α-amino carboxylic acids. In addition to these two groups, there is also a hydrogen atom and a defining side chain attached to the α-C atom of proteinogenic amino acids. The side chain determines how the amino acid "behaves." It can be neutral, charged, acidic, basic, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic. These properties and their interactions with each other ultimately determine the structure of proteins.

The body's proteins are mostly produced by the body itself. However, proteins are also ingested through food. These dietary proteins are broken down in the intestinal tract by so-called peptidases into individual amino acids. These are then used by the organism either for energy production, for the resynthesis of proteins, or for the synthesis of other metabolic products. In this process, the body relies on the intake of certain specific amino acids that it cannot synthesize on its own (so-called essential amino acids). Non-essential amino acids are consequently those that the body can produce itself.
## Amino Acids: Structure and Properties

Amino acids are carboxylic acids that, in addition to the carboxyl group, also contain an amino group at the α-carbon atom. In total, over 100 different amino acids are known. They serve the organism as building blocks of proteins and also play an important role in metabolism, for example, as precursors of various signaling molecules and as substrates for gluconeogenesis.

### Amino Acids

- Definition: Carboxylic acid that carries an amino group as an additional functional group.
- Structure: Composed of at least one carbon atom with an amino group and a carboxyl group as well as a side chain.
- Classification
    - By structure
        - α-Amino acids: The amino group is attached to the α-C atom.
        - β-Amino acids: The amino group is attached to the β-C atom.
        - γ-Amino acids: The amino group is attached to the γ-C atom.
    - After use
        - Proteinogenic Amino Acids
        - Non-proteinogenic amino acids
            - Examples
                - Ornithine and Citrulline: Intermediates of Urea Synthesis
                - β-Alanine: Component of Coenzyme A
                - γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA): Neurotransmitter in the brain

### Proteinogenic Amino Acids

- Definition: Amino acids, from which proteins are made.
    - In humans, there are 21 proteinogenic amino acids.
- Structure: All proteinogenic amino acids are α-amino acids. They differ only in their side chains.
    - Side chains: Variable part of the amino acids that gives them different size, chemical reactivity, charge, and molecular weight.
- Stereoisomerism
    - Are in the L-form → This means that in the Fischer projection, the amino group points to the left at the α-C atom.
    - All proteinogenic amino acids (with the exception of glycine) have a chiral center at the α-C atom.
- Nomenclature: In addition to the chemical name, they have a trivial name, a three-letter abbreviation, and a single letter symbol (see the table below).
- Classification
    - Based on the chemical structures of their side chains and the resulting properties, e.g. (charged/uncharged, hydrophilic/hydrophobic)
    - According to the body's ability to synthesize them (essential amino acids, non-essential amino acids)
    - According to their catabolic pathway (glucogenic amino acids, ketogenic amino acids)

### Acid-Base Properties of Amino Acids

Amino acids are ampholytes, meaning they can react both acidic and basic depending on the pH value. Accordingly, they have at least two pK values.

- pKS values of amino acids
    - pKa value of the carboxyl group: 2
    - pKa value of the amino group: 9–10
    - Possibly pKS value of the side group
- Degree of dissociation of amino acids: Depending on the pH value of the surrounding environment, the amino acids are present in protonated, partially protonated, or deprotonated forms. All functional groups with a pKa value lower than the pH of the environment are deprotonated. All functional groups with a pKa value higher than the pH of the environment are protonated.
    - At pH 1: Both the amino group and the carboxyl group, as well as any ionizable side chain group, are protonated.
    - At pH 6 (roughly speaking, at neutral pH): The amino group is protonated, the carboxyl group is deprotonated; the side group of acidic amino acids is deprotonated, while that of basic amino acids is protonated.
    - At pH 11: Both the amino group and the carboxyl group, as well as the ionizable side group if applicable, are deprotonated (exception: Arginine, whose pKa value of the side group is >12)
- Isoelectric Point (= pI): pH value at which an amino acid (or another ampholyte) has a net charge of "0" externally.
    - Calculation: Results from the averages of the pKa values
        - For amino acids with three pKa values (that is, three ionizable groups), only the pKa values of the similarly ionizing groups are considered (for basic amino acids, this means the two pKa values in the basic range, and for acidic ones, the two in the acidic range)
- Formula: pI = (pKS1 + pKS2) : 2
- Calculation examples:
    - For alanine: pKS1 (COOH) = 2.3 and pKS2 (NH2) = 9.9
        - IP (Alanine) = (pKS1 + pKS2) / 2 = (2.3 + 9.9) / 2 = 6.1
    - For lysine: pKS1 (COOH) = 2.2 and pKS2 (NH2) = 9.0 and pKS3 (NH2) = 10.4
        - IP (Lysin) = (pKS2 + pKS3) / 2 = (9.0 + 10.4) / 2 = 9.7
- Titration curves of amino acids
    - Preliminary remark: Amino acids are ampholytes, therefore one would first need to titrate with an acid in an aqueous solution of the amino acid to capture the carboxyl group and then titrate with a base to capture the amino group.
        1. Amino acids are dissolved in an acid so that the carboxyl group and the amino group are protonated.
        2. Titration with a base (e.g. NaOH)
    - Interpretation: Determination of the inflection points in the flat areas of the curve (pKS values of the curve)
        - If there are only two pKa values, the side chain of the amino acid has no acidic or basic properties. The pKa values correspond to the carboxyl group (pKa = 2–2.5) and the amino group (pKa = 9–10).
        - With three pKa values, the amino acid has a side chain that can also accept or donate protons. Knowing the pKa values of the side chains allows one to infer the amino acid.
            - pKa values of the side chains of the acidic amino acids: Glutamate 4.1; Aspartate 3.9
            - pKa values of the side chains of the uncharged amino acids: Tyrosine 10.5; Cysteine 8.4
            - pKa values of the side chains of the basic amino acids: Lysine 10.5; Arginine 12.5; Histidine 6.0

> [!NOTE]
> At physiological pH (7.4), basic amino acids have a net charge of +1 and acidic amino acids have a net charge of -1.

## Peptides and Proteins: Structure and Properties

Peptides and proteins consist of amino acids that are linked together in an unbranched manner by peptide bonds.

### Peptide

- Definition: Chain of up to 100 amino acids that are linked together by peptide bonds.
- Structure
    - Peptide bond: The linkage of an α-carboxyl group and an α-amino group of two amino acids with the elimination of water (condensation)
        - Conformation of the peptide bond: The peptide bond is planar.
            - Explanation
                - In the peptide bond, the carboxyl group is connected to the amino group by a single bond (C-N single bond)
                - The oxygen of the carboxyl group is much more electronegative than the nitrogen of the amino group.
                - The nitrogen atom of the amino group has a lone pair of electrons and can therefore form two resonance structures.
            - cis-/trans-configuration: The α-C-atoms on both sides of the peptide bond are trans-configured.
                - Exception: Proline, which due to its special structure is preferentially in the cis configuration.
- Classification: Depending on the length of the amino acid chain, one distinguishes
    - Dipeptide: 2 amino acids
        - Can also occur in a cyclic form and then contains two peptide bonds; thus, an anhydride is formed.
    - Tripeptide: 3 amino acids
    - Oligopeptide: Up to 10 amino acids
    - Polypeptide: 10-100 amino acids

> [!NOTE]
> Peptide bonds are formed at the ribosome through the elimination of water and the consumption of energy!

### Proteins

- Definition: A chain of over 100 amino acids linked together by peptide bonds.
- Function: The most important structural unit of the human body
- Structure: Division into primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure (see table "Structure of Proteins")
    - Framework
        - Backbone of the peptide chain: The atomic sequence -N-C-C-N-C-C-N-C-C- resulting from the peptide bond is found in all peptide chains and is referred to as the backbone of the peptide chain. The individual properties of a protein are therefore determined by the side chains of the amino acids.

> [!NOTE]
> The structure of proteins is fundamentally responsible for their function!

|Structure of Proteins|   |
|---|---|
|Primary structure of proteins|The primary structure describes the genetically determined amino acid sequence of a protein|
|- N- and C-terminus: In a protein, there is a free amino group at one end (N-terminus) and a free carboxyl group at the other end (C-terminus)<br>    - By definition, a peptide chain is "read" from the N-terminus to the C-terminus|
|Secondary structure of proteins|The secondary structure is the result of the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl and NH groups of the peptide chain backbone. It is distinguished into α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and Ω-loop|
|- α-Helix: Helically coiled peptide chain that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds within the peptide chain<br>    - Description<br>        - The backbone of the amino acid chain lies parallel to the helix axis, with side chains pointing outward<br>        - Mostly right-handed<br>        - There are 3.6 amino acid side chains per turn<br>- β-Sheet: Linking of at least two peptide chains with hydrogen bonds<br>    - Description<br>        - The backbone is nearly extended, with side chains alternating above and below the sheet plane<br>        - Parallel sheet: The linked peptide chains run in the same direction<br>        - Antiparallel sheet: The peptide chains run in opposite directions<br>        - Mixed sheet: With more than two peptide chains, both parallel and antiparallel can occur<br>- Protein regions that exhibit a regular structure (α-helix or β-sheet structure) are connected by loops or turns, or interrupted by unstructured regions (random coils)<br>    - β-turn: Change of direction in the protein backbone, stabilized by a hydrogen bond and usually consisting of only four amino acids<br>    - Ω-loop: Change of direction in the protein backbone that forms a loop stabilized by hydrogen bonds on the surface of globular proteins|
|Tertiary Structure of Proteins|The tertiary structure is defined as the stable three-dimensional arrangement of the various secondary structures within a protein. It is stabilized by a specific spatial arrangement of amino acids, as well as interactions between the side chains.|
|- Interactions in the formation of the tertiary structure<br>    - Hydrogen bonds<br>    - Van der Waals forces<br>    - Hydrophobic interactions<br>    - Disulfide bridges<br>    - Ionic bonds<br>- Protein domain: Area of a protein with a stable folding structure that can function both structurally and functionally independently of other protein regions<br>    - Example: β-Barrel: Several β-sheets aggregate and form a barrel-like pore structure|
|Quaternary Structure of Proteins|- The quaternary structure arises when a protein consists of multiple individual proteins ("subunits"). It describes how these subunits are organized.<br>    - For example, hemoglobin consists of a total of four subunits that assemble together in a specific manner.|

#### Denaturation of Proteins

The correct spatial structure of proteins is a prerequisite for their functions. When this structure is lost, it is referred to as denaturation. It is often caused by a change in external conditions.

- Types of denaturation: Depending on whether the structure of the protein can be restored after denaturation or not, one distinguishes between reversible and irreversible denaturation.
    - Reversible Denaturation: Upon restoration of the original external conditions, the protein refolds (= Renaturation)
    - Irreversible Denaturation: The destruction of the folding cannot be reversed, as both physical and chemical changes have occurred, such as:
        - Oxidation of cysteines and methionines
        - Deamination of asparagine and glutamine side chains
        - Glycosylation of lysine side chains
- Causes of Denaturation
    - Change of solvent
    - pH changes
    - Temperature changes
    - Addition of urea and iminourea

> [!NOTE] Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
> Misfolded proteins can cause diseases. An important example is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is caused by misfolded proteins known as "prions" (derived from the English "proteins" and "infection"). Prions primarily occur in brain cells. There are physiological and pathogenic variants: Normally, large parts of the prion consist of α-helices, and a smaller part consists of β-sheet structures. However, there is also an "abnormal" variant of the prion, in which this ratio is exactly reversed. The special thing about abnormal prions is that they can "infect" normal prions, meaning that upon contact, they can cause the same fatal conformational change. As a result, normal prions gradually transition into the abnormal state. These abnormal prions are insoluble, accumulate in brain cells, and destroy them over time. As a result of cell death, a porous, sponge-like structure of the brain develops, which is why the disease is also called "spongiform encephalopathy" ("sponge-like brain disease"). Another disease caused by protein misfolding is Alzheimer's disease, in which misfolded so-called "β-amyloid fibrils" accumulate in the brain.

## Digestion and Absorption

### Digestion of Proteins

- Peptidases (syn. Proteases, Proteinases, proteolytic enzymes): Enzymes that hydrolytically cleave peptide bonds (proteolysis). Many peptidases are secreted as catalytically inactive proenzymes (so-called zymogens).
    - Classification by the site of cleavage
        - Endopeptidases (also: endoproteases): cleave at specific sites within the peptide chain
            - Example: Trypsin (cleaves behind the basic amino acids Arginine and Lysine)
        - Exopeptidases: Cleave amino acids from the end of the peptide chain.
            - Aminopeptidases: Cleave amino acids from the N-terminal end
            - Carboxypeptidases: Cleave amino acids from the C-terminal end.
    - Classification by Catalysis Mechanism
        - Serine protease
            - Catalytic Triad: A specific arrangement of three amino acid residues in an enzyme that leads to interactions between these residues, resulting in one of the three residues being particularly activated, meaning it can cleave a peptide bond.
            - Examples: Chymotrypsin
                - Catalytic triad of serine, histidine, and aspartate
                - Mechanism: Nucleophilic attack of the oxygen from the serine residue on the positively polarized carbon atom of the peptide bond
            - Additional examples: Trypsin, Elastase, Plasmin, Thrombin
        - Aspartate protease
            - Characteristics: Two catalytically active aspartic acid residues in the active center
            - Examples: Pepsin, Renin
        - Threonine protease
            - Identifier: A catalytically active threonine residue in the active center
            - Example: The proteolytically active centers of proteasomes, where ubiquitin-tagged proteins are degraded
        - Metalloprotease
            - Sign: A catalytically essential metal ion in the active site
            - Examples: Angiotensin-converting enzyme, Carboxypeptidase A
- Process of Protein Digestion
    1. Stomach: Denaturation of proteins by gastric acid and initial cleavage by the endopeptidase pepsin.
    2. Duodenum: Further cleavage with the help of the pancreatic and intestinal mucosal peptidases
    3. Resorption by the enterocytes (see the following table)

> [!NOTE]
> The pancreatic peptidases are secreted as inactive precursors and are only activated in the duodenum. Trypsinogen (the precursor of trypsin) is cleaved by the peptidases of the intestinal mucosa, and all other precursors are then activated by trypsin!

> [!NOTE]
> Pepsinogen is the precursor to pepsin and is converted into its active form by gastric acid!

> [!NOTE] Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
> In the lungs, trypsin has the task of cleaving foreign proteins that have entered. Its activity is kept in check by the body's own antitrypsin, which prevents self-digestion of lung tissue. In the context of a hereditary antitrypsin deficiency, the lack of inhibition of trypsin leads to a progressive destruction of lung tissue, which is particularly noticeable in the form of pronounced pulmonary emphysema and respiratory insufficiency.

> [!NOTE] Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
> As a result of diseases affecting the pancreas (such as pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis), there can be destruction of the cells of the exocrine pancreas. This is associated with a reduced production of pancreatic digestive enzymes, including peptidases. In children, this often presents as failure to thrive (insufficient weight gain despite adequate food intake), while in adults it manifests as weight loss. Characteristic are also the so-called "fatty stools," which arise from poor fat digestion. This condition is referred to as "exocrine pancreatic insufficiency."

### Resorption of Proteins

- Absorption in the intestine
    - Resorption of individual amino acids: Through Na+-coupled carrier proteins that are specific for different amino acid groups (neutral, branched-chain, aromatic, acidic, basic)
    - Resorption of di-, tri-, and tetrapeptides: Probably via a proton symport
- Transport in the blood: Transport via the portal vein to the liver
- Uptake into liver cells: Through specific carrier proteins (similar to those in the intestines)

> [!NOTE]
> Newborns can also uptake intact proteins (such as maternal antibodies) through pinocytosis into enterocytes, as there are initially only a few peptidases present in the digestive tract and colostrum (i.e., pre-milk) contains peptidase inhibitors!

## Protein Degradation

As part of normal protein turnover, proteins are constantly synthesized and degraded in all body cells. Cell-specific proteins are selectively degraded in the so-called proteasome. The degradation of foreign proteins, which are taken up by endocytosis, occurs in the lysosomes.

### Proteasomal Protein Degradation

- Ubiquitination: Proteins to be degraded are marked with the polypeptide ubiquitin, and this marking is catalyzed by three enzymes.
    1. Activation of ubiquitin to AMP-ubiquitin by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)
    2. Binding of ubiquitin to a cysteinyl residue of E1 with the cleavage of AMP
    3. Transfer of ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)
    4. Transfer of ubiquitin to a lysine residue of the protein to be degraded by the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). An isopeptide bond (amide bond) is formed.
- Deconstruction
    - Procedure: The proteasome recognizes the protein marked by a chain of ubiquitins, binds to it, and begins the proteolytic cleavage.
    - Involved structures
        - Proteasome: ATP-dependent protease complex (26S proteasome), consisting of three subunits
            - 20S-Subunit: Non-specific peptidase activity
            - Two 19S subunits: Separation of the ubiquitin molecules
        - Further utilization of the degradation products: Peptide fragments from the proteasome can be presented on the cell surface via MHC-I molecules.

### Lysosomal degradation of foreign proteins

Proteins taken up through endocytosis are degraded in the lysosomes. The lysosomal degradation of cellular macromolecules mediated by autophagy occurs similarly.

1. Foreign proteins are taken up by endocytosis, so they are initially located in endosomes (endocytosis vesicles).
2. The endosomes in the cell periphery are referred to as "early endosomes." They migrate into the cell interior, where they are then called "late endosomes."
3. The late endosomes fuse with lysosomes.
4. The peptide bonds of the foreign proteins are now cleaved by the lysosomal hydrolases.

## Review Questions on the Chapter Amino Acids and Proteins
### Amino Acids: Structure and Properties

Describe the general structure of proteinogenic amino acids!
- Proteinogenic amino acids are carboxylic acids that, in addition to the carboxyl group at the α-C atom, also carry an amino group, which in the Fischer projection points to the left (L-form). The side chains form the variable part of the amino acids, granting them different properties. With the exception of glycine, all proteinogenic amino acids have a chiral center at the α-C atom.
Name properties of histidine!
- Histidine is a conditionally essential, proteinogenic, hydrophilic amino acid. It carries an imidazole ring (heterocyclic) in its side chain, which is protonated at pH 7. Thus, histidine belongs to the basic, positively charged amino acids.
Name properties of leucine and isoleucine!
- Leucine and its constitutional isomer isoleucine belong to the essential, proteinogenic amino acids. Each contains a branched aliphatic side chain and are therefore nonpolar/hydrophobic.
Which two proteinogenic amino acids contain sulfur, and in what form does sulfur occur in each?
- There are two proteinogenic sulfur-containing amino acids: Methionine contains a thioether group (-S) in its otherwise aliphatic side chain; cysteine contains a thiol (SH group) in its side chain, which can form hydrogen bonds (disulfide bridges).
Which proteinogenic amino acids are positively charged at physiological pH (around pH 7)?
- In all proteinogenic amino acids, the carboxyl groups (COOH group) are deprotonated and thus negatively charged at pH 7. However, arginine, lysine, and histidine contain additional side groups that are protonated and thus positively charged at pH 7.
Which proteinogenic amino acids belong to the acidic amino acids? How are they charged at physiological pH (around pH 7)?
- The acidic amino acids glutamate and aspartate contain an additional carboxyl group in their side chain. At physiological pH, this is negatively charged, so both amino acids are doubly negatively charged. However, since each also has an amino group (NH2) that is protonated at physiological pH, the net charge is “-1.”
Which of the proteinogenic amino acids belong to the aromatic amino acids? What ring system does each of them contain?
- The aromatic proteinogenic amino acids include tryptophan, histidine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Tryptophan and histidine contain heterocycles (indole ring and imidazole ring), while tyrosine and phenylalanine each have a benzene ring (six-membered ring), with tyrosine carrying an additional OH group.
What special structure does proline have?
- The amino acid proline has a special conformation: its hydrophobic side chain is linked not only to an α-C atom but also to an amino group. This forms a (non-aromatic) pyrrolidine ring.
How is selenocysteine synthesized?
- Selenocysteine is synthesized during translation from the amino acid serine. Therefore, it is often referred to as the 21st proteinogenic amino acid.
Name all essential amino acids!
- Essential amino acids must be taken up with food because the body cannot synthesize them. These include: phenylalanine, isoleucine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, valine, lysine, and threonine (“Phenomenal Isolde sometimes clouds Lieutenant Valentin’s lustful dreams.”).
How are the amino and carboxyl groups at the α-C-atom of amino acids charged at physiological pH?
- At physiological pH, the amino group of an amino acid is protonated (positively charged), and the carboxyl group is deprotonated (negatively charged).
What is the isoelectric point of an amino acid and how is it calculated?
- The isoelectric point (= pI) of an amino acid denotes the pH at which an amino acid has a net charge of “0” externally. It is calculated from the average of the pKa values (a measure of acidity) of the carboxyl, amino, and other side groups. For acidic amino acids, the isoelectric point is calculated as the average of the two pKa values in the acidic range; for basic amino acids, as the average of the two pKa values in the basic range (formula: pI = (pKa1 + pKa2) ÷ 2).
### Peptides and Proteins: Structure and Properties

How is a peptide bond formed and what is its conformation?
- Peptide bonds link an α-carboxyl group and an α-amino group of two amino acids with the elimination of H2O (condensation). These are planar bonds because the four atoms lie in one plane.
In what ways can two amino acids bond?
- The connection of two amino acids is called a dipeptide. This can be either a linear dipeptide with one peptide bond or a cyclic dipeptide with two peptide bonds (an anhydride).
Which atomic sequence is referred to as the backbone of the peptide chain?
- Peptides and proteins consist of linear chains of amino acids, all of which have the repeating atomic sequence -N-C-C-N-C-C-N-C-C- as the backbone. The variable side chains of individual amino acids project from this backbone and determine the individual properties of the peptide or protein.
What secondary structures of proteins do you know? How do they arise?
- Secondary structures of proteins arise through the formation of hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl and NH groups of the peptide chain backbone. They include the α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and Ω-loop, whereby different secondary structures can occur in different regions within the same protein.
Describe the characteristics of an α-helix! How many amino acid side chains are present approximately per 360° turn?
- An α-helix is a screw-shaped, usually right-handed peptide chain that is stabilized by hydrogen bonds within the chain. The backbone runs parallel to the helix axis, and the side chains point outward. There are approximately 3.6 amino acid side chains per 360° turn.
When does a protein form a quaternary structure? Name an example!
- A quaternary structure arises when a protein consists of more than one polypeptide chain (“subunit”). It describes how these subunits assemble. Hemoglobin, for example, consists of four subunits arranged in a specific manner.
### Digestion and Absorption

How is pepsin produced and what is its function?
- Pepsin is the (endo-)protease of gastric juice and cleaves peptide bonds in dietary proteins after activation from its precursor pepsinogen.
How are peptides absorbed in the intestine?
- Peptides are absorbed into enterocytes from the intestinal lumen together with protons. The proton gradient between the lumen and the intracellular space of the enterocytes required for this is maintained by a Na+/H+ exchanger, which exports protons from the cell and imports sodium into the cell.
How is trypsin produced? At which point does it typically cleave peptide bonds?
- Trypsin is formed in the duodenum by cleavage of the inactive precursor peptide trypsinogen secreted by the pancreas. It is one of the so-called endopeptidases, which cleave proteins internally at specific sites rather than at the ends of the amino acid chain. Trypsin always cleaves after the basic amino acids arginine or lysine.
What characteristic do aspartic proteases have? Name typical examples!
- Aspartic proteases have two catalytically active aspartic acid residues in their active center. Examples include pepsin and renin.
Describe the function of serine proteases and provide examples!
- Serine proteases are a group of enzymes with a specific arrangement of three amino acid residues in their catalytic center (the so-called catalytic triad): aspartate, histidine, and the eponymous serine. Interactions among these residues result in high reactivity of the serine residue. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack of the oxygen of the serine residue on the positively polarized carbon atom of the peptide bond, which is thereby hydrolyzed. Typical serine proteases are chymotrypsin, trypsin, elastase, plasmin, and thrombin.
### Protein Degradation

What is the purpose of the ubiquitination of proteins and how does it occur? What type of bond is present afterward?
- Proteins to be degraded in proteasomes are marked with multiple ubiquitin molecules. Ubiquitin is first activated with ATP to AMP-ubiquitin and then bound to a cysteinyl residue, releasing AMP. From there it is transferred first to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and then to a lysine residue of the protein to be degraded. This covalent bond is an amide or isopeptide bond.
What do proteasomes have to do with MHC molecules?
- Proteasomes are protease complexes of the cytosol responsible for the degradation of (ubiquitinated) proteins. Peptide fragments from the proteasome can then be passed to MHC-I molecules and presented on the cell surface. This mechanism serves, among other things, to recognize and eliminate virus-infected and transformed cells, since CD8+ effector cells (cytotoxic T cells) recognize the MHC-I-presented antigen fragments and can induce apoptosis if necessary.
