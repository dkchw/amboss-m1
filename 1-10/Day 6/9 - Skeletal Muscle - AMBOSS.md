# Skeletal Muscle
## Summary

The skeletal muscle consists of many multinucleated muscle cells (= muscle fibers), which contain contractile myofilaments (actin and myosin) arranged in a regular pattern. The consciously induced interaction of these proteins primarily serves the movement of the skeleton. The contraction is triggered by an action potential of a somatic nerve, which is transmitted to the muscle via the so-called motor end plate. This process leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration within the muscle cell, which in turn results in an interaction of actin and myosin (so-called electromechanical coupling).

## Organization and Structure

A skeletal muscle is a complex structure made up of various components. The myofilaments actin and myosin, whose smallest functional unit is called a "sarcomere," are grouped together into larger myofibrils that fill a large muscle cell (= muscle fiber). The muscle fibers are further grouped together into increasingly larger bundles by sheath structures. The assembled muscle is entirely surrounded by the muscle fascia.

> [!NOTE]
> The connective tissue sheaths of the muscle serve as a guiding structure for nerves and vessels, allowing them to reach each individual muscle cell through the endomysium!

### Characteristics of a Skeletal Muscle Fiber (= Skeletal Muscle Cell)

Skeletal muscle cells have the same function as all muscle cells: they are meant to enable contractions. For this purpose, they possess the contractile myofilaments actin and myosin on one hand, and specialized cellular structures to control them on the other hand. Through deep invaginations in the cell membrane (T-tubules), the excitation that spreads across the cell membrane is brought in close proximity to the intracellular myofilaments and organelles. This allows the excitation to be easily transmitted to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which serves as a calcium reservoir and is expanded into terminal cisternae. For more fundamentals on the structure of muscle tissue and myofilaments, see: Fundamentals of Muscle Tissue.

- Cell morphology: The skeletal muscle fiber corresponds to a single cell with many peripheral nuclei.
- Sarcolemmal Invaginations: T-Tubules
- Calcium storage: The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is significantly expanded into so-called L-tubules with terminal cisternae.
- Myofilaments
    - Arrangement: Regular arrangement of actin and myosin into so-called sarcomeres
    - Activation: To enable the interaction between actin and myosin, a sufficient amount of calcium must bind to the troponin complex.
    - Anchoring: Sarcomeres are connected to each other and to the cell membrane in the area of the Z-lines via intermediate filaments (e.g., desmin).
- Regeneration: Occurs through satellite cells that lie between the muscle cells.

> [!NOTE]
> Skeletal muscle cells can only be regenerated by so-called satellite cells!

## Contraction

Skeletal muscles are controlled by motor nerve fibers from the spinal cord or cranial nerves. The action potential transmitted through the nerves is transferred to the muscle at the so-called "motor end plate," a chemical synapse. The subsequent translation of this electrical signal into a mechanical contraction is referred to as "electromechanical coupling." For details on the molecular interaction of the myofilaments actin and myosin (sliding filament theory), see: Basics of Muscle Tissue.

### Involved Structures

- Motor end plate
    - Definition: A muscle fiber is innervated by an α-motor neuron, whose axon splits into several synaptic end bulbs at the motor end plate.
    - Function: Transmission of the action potential of an α-motor neuron to a muscle fiber using acetylcholine to stimulate the muscle fiber to contract
    - Receptor and transmitter: Acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynapse binds to muscle-specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
    - Termination of synaptic transmission: Acetylcholinesterase on the postsynaptic membrane splits acetylcholine into choline and acetate → Reuptake and recycling of choline and acetate by the presynapse for the resynthesis of acetylcholine
- Motor unit
    - Definition: The sum of all muscle fibers innervated by an α-motoneuron
    - Functions
        - Combined and coordinated contraction of similarly oriented muscle fibers
        - Gradation of muscle strength through the recruitment of varying numbers of motor units

> [!NOTE] Muscle atrophy
> The innervation of the muscle by an α-motoneuron is necessary to maintain its shape and function. If the connection between the muscle and nerve is severed, for example, by a cut ("denervation"), the muscle ultimately loses not only its strength (known as paresis) but also fundamentally changes its structure: the sarcolemma produces a multitude of acetylcholine receptors, the thickness of the muscle fibers (atrophy) continuously decreases, and the organization of their myofibrils declines. Eventually, the muscle fiber dies. If the muscle and nerve are reconnected (for example, through nerve suturing), these changes are largely reversible.

> [!NOTE]
> All muscle fibers that are innervated by an α-motor neuron are referred to as a motor unit! The fewer muscle fibers that are simultaneously innervated by a neuron (as in the case of the eye muscles), the finer the movements that are possible!

> [!NOTE]
> All muscle fibers of a motor unit belong to the same skeletal muscle fiber type (e.g., Type I), as determined by the innervating α-motor neuron!

### Neuromuscular Transmission at the Motor End Plate

1. Action potential spreads along the axon of an α-motoneuron towards the muscle.
2. The axon branches and reaches several muscle fibers simultaneously (= motor unit)
3. The axon ends in the form of a chemical synapse at the muscle fiber (= motor end plate)
4. The action potential of the α-motoneuron leads to the release of acetylcholine at the presynapse.
5. Acetylcholine binds to postsynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors and leads to depolarization there.
6. Depolarization leads to an increase in the end plate potential until a threshold potential is exceeded (so-called excitatory postsynaptic potential).
7. EPSP leads to the opening of voltage-gated Na+ channels → Triggering of an action potential
8. Propagation of the action potential across the sarcolemma → Initiation of a contraction (so-called electromechanical coupling, see below)

> [!NOTE]
> The synaptic transmission at the motor end plate is terminated by the breakdown of acetylcholine in the subsynaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase!

> [!NOTE] Myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome
> There is a group of diseases in which autoantibodies are formed against structures of the motor end plate. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies are usually formed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Due to the receptors blocked by the antibodies, the release of acetylcholine in the subsynaptic cleft leads to a reduced excitatory postsynaptic potential. The electromechanical coupling is disturbed to such an extent that the skeletal muscles of those affected show a load-dependent weakness. Typically, the eye, facial, and throat muscles are affected early, which can manifest as drooping eyelids (ptosis), double vision, and difficulties in swallowing and speaking. Another myasthenic syndrome is the paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome, which occurs particularly in small cell bronchial carcinomas. Here, pathognomonic antibodies against voltage-dependent calcium channels lead to a reduced release of acetylcholine. The reduced concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft results in a proximal muscle weakness of the extremities. Therapeutically, the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft can be increased by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine.

> [!NOTE] Muscle relaxants and curare
> The transmission of information at the motor end plate can be consciously interrupted by certain substances (so-called muscle relaxants), leading to paralysis or relaxation of the affected muscle. This is intentionally induced, for example, during surgeries. There are two groups of muscle relaxants that differ in terms of triggering an excitatory postsynaptic potential: depolarizing and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, such as curare (arrow poison of South American indigenous people), act as competitive antagonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor without activating it. These competitive antagonists can be displaced by sufficient ACh (for example, through acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Depolarizing muscle relaxants, such as succinylcholine, act as agonists at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This leads to permanent depolarization of the postsynaptic muscle cell membrane. Due to the lack of repolarization, no further action potentials can be triggered, and the muscle remains paralyzed after initial contraction. Attention must be paid to the paralysis of the respiratory muscles with all muscle relaxants.

### Electromechanical Coupling in Skeletal Muscle

1. Spread of the action potential over the sarcolemma into the T-tubules.
2. Opening of membrane-bound voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (so-called dihydropyridine receptors, DHP receptors) in the area of the T-tubules → Conformational change of the DHP receptor
3. Direct protein-protein interaction of the modified DHP receptor (of the sarcolemma) with the ryanodine receptor (ion channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum or L-tubules)
4. Activation of the Ryanodine receptor makes it permeable to Ca2+ → Calcium influx from the SR into the sarcoplasm
5. Calcium levels in the sarcoplasm rise sharply.
6. Conformational change of the accompanying proteins due to binding of Ca2+ → Myosin binding sites on the actin are released by tropomyosin.
7. Interaction of actin and myosin possible → Contraction (for a detailed process see: filament sliding theory)
8. Termination of contraction by lowering the intracellular calcium level (reuptake of Ca2+ into the SR by the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase) and repolarization (here also through Cl--channels, among others)

> [!NOTE] Malignant Hyperthermia
> There is a group of people in whom the ryanodine receptor of muscle cells is altered due to a genetic defect. Because of this alteration, the ryanodine receptor is directly activated by certain substances such as inhalation anesthetics (like isoflurane). This leads to an uncontrolled outflow of calcium into the sarcoplasm, which stimulates the myofibrils to a state of sustained contraction. This strong sustained contraction greatly increases the energy and oxygen consumption of the muscle cell. On one hand, this leads to an accumulation of acidic lactate (so-called lactic acidosis) due to increased anaerobic glycolysis, and on the other hand, to a significant heat production due to the heightened muscle metabolism. This life-threatening condition is referred to as "malignant hyperthermia."

## Skeletal Muscle Mechanics

The task of the skeletal muscle is its contraction. Different forms of contraction are distinguished depending on whether the muscle length, the muscle tension, or both are changed. The force developed during this can be described using basic lever laws of mechanics. The development of force can be controlled by the body in various ways, for example, by altering the frequency of action potentials.

### Important Basic Concepts of Muscle Mechanics

- Coordination of muscles
    - Agonist: Executing muscle whose direction of movement is opposite to that of the antagonist.
    - Antagonist: Muscle whose direction of movement is opposite to that of the agonist.
    - Synergist: Supports the movement of an agonist (e.g., by stabilizing the movement)
    - Muscle chains
        - Natural movements such as walking arise from the interplay of several muscles that form functional units in the form of so-called muscle chains.
        - Contracting coordinated
- Pull direction of a muscle
    - Without deflection: Corresponds to the direction between the muscle belly and the insertion (so-called main line)
    - In deflection over the hypomochlion: direction between the hypomochlion and the attachment
- Mechanical self-control
    - Due to the acute angle at which a muscle attaches to its tendon (pennation angle), a shortening of its muscle fibers leads to an increase in the pennation angle.
    - In this way, a muscle contraction increases the distance between muscle fibers and creates space for an increase in the thickness of the muscle fiber.
- Hub height
    - The length difference of a muscle before and after its contraction is referred to as the lift height.
    - Is primarily determined by fiber length and feathering angle.
- Principle of Zuggurtung
    - Starting position: If a force acts beside the center of the bone, it will be subjected to bending on one side and compression on the other side.
    - Problem: Bone is much more stable in terms of compression than in tension.
    - Solution: Parallel to the bone is a tendon that is under tension, which subjects the bone primarily to compression.
    - Example: Force acting vertically on the femoral head, which is absorbed by the iliotibial tract, thereby primarily placing the femur under compressive load.
- Muscle cross-section
    - Anatomically: Corresponds to the cross-section of the thickest part of the muscle belly (perpendicular to the main line)
    - Physiological: Results from the cross-section of all muscle fibers and is larger than the anatomical cross-section in feathered muscles.
- Muscle insufficiency
    - Active: Although a muscle is maximally shortened, the moved joint cannot be brought into its final position.
    - Passive: Although the moving joint would allow for further movement, the movement cannot be executed because the antagonistic muscle is maximally stretched.

> [!NOTE]
> The anatomical and physiological muscle cross-section is only equal in parallel-fibered muscles!

> [!NOTE]
> In the case of passive muscle insufficiency, movement cannot be performed even with active assistance!

> [!NOTE]
> Whether a muscle acts agonistically, antagonistically, or synergistically always depends on the movement in question!

### Relaxation Curve of Skeletal Muscle

When an isolated skeletal muscle is passively stretched and the force applied during this process is measured, one obtains the so-called resting stretch curve of skeletal muscle.

### Overview of Types of Contractions

A muscle can contract in different ways. The type of contraction is determined by the combination of length and force changes. Based on the changes in muscle length, dynamic contractions are distinguished from static muscle contractions, in which the length remains constant. Among dynamic contractions, muscle elongation (known as eccentric contraction) is differentiated from muscle shortening (concentric muscle contraction).

> [!NOTE] Sore muscles
> Muscle soreness refers to a painful tension feeling in the muscles that peaks 1-2 days after unusual high physical exertion. This typically occurs after movements with high braking forces (e.g., going downhill, eccentric strength training, plyometric training, sports with many changes of direction). The cause is microtrauma in the area of the Z-discs. The pain is triggered by the subsequent autolysis of the destroyed muscle fibers and the accompanying inflammatory reaction (edema formation, release of tissue hormones such as bradykinin). Light muscular work can help with the subsequent increase in blood flow to transport the inflammatory mediators and alleviate the pain.

### Control of Force Development

The strength of a muscle is influenced by various factors. These primarily include the optimal overlap of myofilaments, the frequency of action potentials, and the number of activated motor units (recruitment).

| Overview of the Influences on Force Development                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                                                               | Brief description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Initial length of the sarcomeres                                               | - Optimal overlap of myosin and actin leads to optimal force development<br>- Strong compression and stretching of the muscle reduces actin-myosin overlap and decreases force development |
| Action potential frequency of the α-motor neuron (so-called frequency coding)           | - With a high action potential frequency, the individual muscle twitches overlap to form a strong common contraction (tetanus contraction, see below)                                      |
| Number of simultaneously activated motor units (so-called recruitment) | - The more motor units are recruited, the more actin-myosin contacts there are, and the more force the muscle can develop                                                                |

> [!NOTE]
> Due to various factors that have not yet been fully clarified (including presumably strong activation of muscle spindles through stretching), an eccentric contraction achieves a greater maximum force than isometric or concentric muscle contractions!

#### Frequency encoding of muscle strength

The strength of a skeletal muscle is low when it is stimulated to a single twitch by a single action potential. However, when the skeletal muscle is activated by rapidly successive action potentials, the individual twitches overlap into a powerful contraction (known as tetanic contraction). In this way, the CNS is able to control muscle strength through the frequency of action potentials (known as frequency coding).

- Single twitch: A single suprathreshold stimulus leads to a single twitch, after which the muscle relaxes again (e.g. patellar tendon reflex)
- Tetanus contraction
    - Definition: If a muscle contracts due to a second action potential while it is still contracted, the contractions merge (so-called superposition) into a tetanic contraction.
    - Reason: Intracellular calcium levels remain elevated because the sarcoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase cannot pump the Ca2+ back into the SR quickly enough.
    - Types
        - Incomplete tetanus: The second action potential stimulates the muscle during the descending phase of the first contraction to contract again.
        - Complete tetanus: The second action potential stimulates the muscle during the ascending phase of the first contraction to contract again (definition of maximum force development).

> [!NOTE]
> In muscle contraction, the principle is: More is more! Up to the point of reaching complete tetanus, an increase in action potential frequency leads to an increase in force development!

> [!NOTE]
> The action potential frequency at which an incomplete tetanus transitions into a complete tetanus is referred to as the fusion frequency!

> [!NOTE]
> The physiological action potential frequency is usually below the fusion frequency, so incomplete tetanus is the most common contraction form of skeletal muscles!

### Leverage, Torque, and Power in Skeletal Muscle

When a weight is moved by a muscle, various forces are at play that can be described using the lever law: Force × Moment arm = Load × Load arm. In order for a skeletal part to be moved around a pivot point (e.g., the elbow joint), the skeletal muscle must generate the necessary "rotational force," known as torque.

- Basic considerations
    - The force for the movement of skeletal elements by muscles can be described by the laws of levers.
    - In circular movements around joints, the force is described using torque.
    - The length l of the lever arm corresponds to the distance between the point of application of the force and the center of rotation.
    - Torque depends on the angle between the force and the lever arm.
    - Simplification of the torque assumes a load acting vertically on the lever arm
- Lever Law: Force × Lever Arm = Load × Load Arm
    - Units: Force = Muscle force [N], Moment arm = Distance between [joint and tendon insertion m], Load = [Weight force of the load N], Load arm = Distance between [joint and load m]
- Torque: M = l × F
    - Units: M = Torque [Nm], l = Length of the lever arm [m], F = Force [N] (perpendicular to the lever arm)
- Example calculation: Holding a weight with a bent arm
    - Given
        - Last = 10 N (weight force of a 1-kg weight)
        - Lastarm = 30 cm (Distance between the elbow joint and the weight or load)
        - Lever arm = 3 cm (distance between the elbow joint and the insertion of the biceps tendon)
    - Sought: Muscle strength: F [N]
    - Calculation rule: Force × Lever arm = Load × Load arm
        - Force = Load Arm / Effort Arm × Load
        - Force = 30 cm/3 cm × 10 N
        - Force = 100 N
- Muscle performance
    - Definition: In muscles, the product of muscle force and shortening velocity is referred to as the power of muscle contraction.
    - Calculation: Muscle power = Muscle strength × Shortening velocity = P = F × s/Δt
        - Unit: W (Watt = J/s)
        - P = Power, t = Time, F = Muscle Force, s/Δt = Shortening Speed
    - Context: The faster a muscle contracts, the less force can be exerted, and vice versa (represented by the so-called Hill hyperbola)
    - Maximum in skeletal muscle: When using approximately ⅓ of the maximum strength, muscle performance reaches its peak.

> [!NOTE] Electromyography (EMG)
> The activity of the muscles can be derived and displayed using electromyography (EMG). For this purpose, a needle electrode is inserted into the muscle, and the electrical activity is first measured in the resting muscle and then during varying degrees of voluntary contraction. Both tonic ("holding work") and phasic ("movement work") muscle activity can be displayed.

## Classification of Skeletal Muscles and Fibers

### Criteria for the Classification of a Skeletal Muscle

Skeletal muscles can be classified macroscopically based on various criteria such as muscle shape, fiber arrangement, and joint involvement.

| Feathered                          | The muscle fibers attach obliquely (at the so-called feathering angle) to a tendon.

### Classification of Skeletal Muscle Fibers

Different requirements are placed on skeletal muscle cells or fibers, which is why skeletal muscle fiber types exhibit significant functional differences. These differences are primarily based on differing cellular compositions, which enable the muscle cell to either sustain long-lasting contractions (Type I fibers; "Slow Twitch" fibers) or to perform short and powerful contractions (Type II fibers; "Fast-Twitch" fibers). A whole skeletal muscle always consists of a mixture of skeletal muscle fiber types.

|                | **Type I Fibers** | **Type IIa Fibers** | **Type IIb Fibers** |
|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Contraction frequency (ATPase activity)** | Low | High | High |
| **Duration of Load** | Long | Medium | Short |
| **Metabolism** | ATP production mainly through | Oxidative Phosphorylation | Oxidative Phosphorylation | (Anaerobic) Glycolysis |
| **Mitochondria** | Many | Many | Few |
| **Oxygen storage (Myoglobin content)** | High | High | Low |
| **Lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH)** | Low | Medium | High |

> [!NOTE]
> The cellular composition of skeletal muscle fiber types is based on their function. To generate sustained force, Type I fibers burn fatty acids, for which they require a lot of oxygen (high myoglobin content) and many mitochondria. In contrast, Type IIb fibers obtain short-term energy primarily from anaerobic glycolysis, which does not require either mitochondria or oxygen. However, the activity of LDH in Type IIb fibers is high for the conversion of the lactate produced in this process!

> [!NOTE]
> Slow-twitch fibers (low contraction frequency) fatigue very slowly and therefore primarily perform prolonged holding work (e.g., back muscles). Fast-twitch fibers, on the other hand, fatigue quickly and are more suited for rapid contractions (e.g., upper arm muscles)!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Skeletal Muscle
### Organization and Structure

Describe the general structure of a skeletal muscle cell!
- The skeletal muscle cell, also called a muscle fiber, is an elongated cell with multiple nuclei located peripherally just beneath the cell membrane (= sarcolemma). The sarcolemma has deep invaginations (T-tubules) that are important for excitation propagation. Inside the cytoplasm (= sarcoplasm), the skeletal muscle cell is filled with myofibrils. These represent the functional unit of the muscle fibers and are composed of the two contractile myofilaments myosin and actin. Surrounding the myofibrils is the endoplasmic reticulum of the skeletal muscle cell (= sarcoplasmic reticulum), which consists of longitudinal L-tubules and circular terminal cisternae and serves as a calcium store for electromechanical coupling.

### Contraction

What is meant by muscle relaxants and which two groups can be distinguished regarding their effect at the motor end plate?
- Muscle relaxants are substances that lead to relaxation, i.e., relaxation or paralysis, of the skeletal muscles and are therefore also used as drugs in anesthesia. Regarding their effect at the motor end plate, non-depolarizing (e.g., curare) and depolarizing muscle relaxants (succinylcholine) can be distinguished.

Explain the mechanism of action of succinylcholine!
- Succinylcholine is a depolarizing muscle relaxant and acts as an agonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the motor end plate and thus also depolarizes like acetylcholine. However, since succinylcholine is not degraded by acetylcholinesterase, a persistent depolarization occurs, rendering the motor end plate unexcitable.

Explain the mechanism of action of Curare!
- Curare is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant and acts as a competitive antagonist at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the motor end plate. It competes with acetylcholine for the binding sites on the acetylcholine receptor but does not activate it. At sufficiently high concentrations of curare in the synaptic cleft, depolarization cannot take place. Increasing the acetylcholine concentration (e.g., by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase) can weaken the effect of curare.

Explain the mode of action of botulinum toxin!
- Botulinum toxin ("Botox"), which is used among other things for cosmetic purposes, irreversibly prevents the release of acetylcholine into the subsynaptic cleft by inhibiting the fusion of acetylcholine-containing vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Even tiny amounts of this neurotoxin, which is synthesized by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, lead to paralysis with the risk of fatal respiratory paralysis.

Which two receptors are particularly important for electromechanical coupling in skeletal muscle?
- Electromechanical coupling refers to the conversion of the muscle cell's electrical action potential into mechanical contraction. A key prerequisite for this is a high intracellular calcium concentration, achieved by the interaction of two different receptors functioning as calcium channels. Upon depolarization of the muscle cell, voltage-dependent dihydropyridine receptors located in the sarcolemma's T-tubules open. Besides the resulting calcium influx from outside into the cell, the conformational change of the dihydropyridine receptor also activates the ryanodine receptor located in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This leads to the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm. The interplay of both receptors thus causes a significant increase in calcium levels in the sarcoplasm.

### Skeletal Muscle Mechanics

How is the direction of pull of a muscle determined?
- The direction of pull of a muscle is determined by its main line (= the line between the muscle origin and insertion). If a tendon is redirected over a hypomochlion, then the segment between the hypomochlion and the muscle insertion determines the direction of pull.

What is meant by the anatomical and physiological cross-section of the muscle?
- The cross-section of the muscle at its thickest point is called the anatomical cross-section; the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the individual muscle fibers is called the physiological cross-section. In parallel-fibered muscles, anatomical and physiological cross-sections are identical. In pennate muscles, the physiological cross-section is larger than the anatomical cross-section due to the non-parallel orientation of the fibers. The larger the (physiological) muscle cross-section, the greater the maximum force of the muscle.

What is meant by concentric, eccentric, and isometric muscle contraction?
- The tensing of a muscle is called contraction. This can occur with shortening (concentric contraction), lengthening (eccentric contraction), or no change in length of the muscle (isometric contraction). In eccentric contraction (e.g., when lowering the body after a pull-up by the biceps brachii), a muscle can develop more force than in isometric or concentric contraction.

Through which factors can muscle strength be increased?
- An increase in muscle strength is mainly caused by three different mechanisms: by an increased number of simultaneously activated motor units (recruitment), by raising the action potential frequency of the α-motor neuron (frequency coding), and by optimizing the length of the sarcomeres with the resulting maximum overlap of actin and myosin, which depends on the prestretching of the skeletal muscle fiber.

What is meant by tetanic contraction?
- A single suprathreshold stimulus causes the muscle to respond with only a single twitch and low force development. However, if further action potentials follow before the muscle can fully relax, the twitches add up to a strong, continuous contraction called tetanic contraction. Thus, muscle force is increased by an elevated action potential frequency (frequency coding).

How is muscle performance defined and at what exertion can the muscle achieve its maximum performance?
- Power (P) is the work (W) performed per time (t): P = W / Δt. Work is defined as the force (F) applied along a distance (s): W = F × s. For muscle power, this results in: P = F × s / Δt. Since the ratio of distance to time is velocity (s/Δt), the muscle's power equals muscle force times shortening velocity. Shortening velocity decreases with increasing muscle load; maximum muscle power is reached when the muscle exerts about 30% of its maximum force.

### Classification of Skeletal Muscles and Fibers

What types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished?
- Different demands placed on the musculature require a different composition of specialized muscle fibers. Based on their cellular equipment, they are classified into slow type I fibers, particularly fast type IIb fibers, and the intermediate type IIa fibers. Type I fibers mainly cover their energy demand from aerobic metabolism. They are therefore rich in mitochondria and myoglobin and contract slowly but enduringly, which is especially important in muscles with a holding function. In muscles performing fast and powerful muscle work, the fast and strong but rapidly fatiguing type IIb fibers predominate. These cover their energy demand mainly by anaerobic glycolysis, which is why they have large glycogen stores and a high lactate dehydrogenase activity. Their content of mitochondria and myoglobin is low. The type IIa fibers, as an intermediate type, have a medium activity of lactate dehydrogenase and, like type I fibers, are rich in mitochondria and myoglobin.
