# Neck and Back
## Summary

The dorsal parts of the neck (cervical region) and the trunk (dorsal body wall) are referred to as the back (Dorsum). Thus, the back extends from the occipital bone (Os occipitale) to the tip of the coccyx (Os coccygis).

The surface relief of the back is determined by muscles that have migrated from the ventrolateral body wall ("non-autochthonous musculature"), which overlay the back muscles that developed embryonically on site ("autochthonous musculature"). The autogenous musculature is innervated by the posterior rami, while the non-autochthonous musculature is innervated by the anterior rami of the spinal nerves. The back musculature has, on one hand, a static function to tension the vertebrae against each other, but it also has a dynamic function that ensures the mobility of the torso around three axes.

Skin and musculature of the back are primarily supplied with blood by the paired dorsal rami of the intercostal arteries. Of topographical significance are the so-called deep nuchal triangle located beneath the trapezius muscle, through which the vertebral artery and the suboccipital nerve run, as well as the Michaelis rhombus in the female lumbar region.

The organs and conduits of the neck (see: Overview of the Head and Neck Region) and the spine responsible for the stability of the back are each addressed in separate chapters.
## Musculature of the Spine

### Overview of the Musculature of the Spine

- Outline
    1. Short neck muscles (head joint muscles)
        - Native
        - Non-autochthonous
    2. Back muscles
        - Native
        - Non-autochthonous
- Function
    - Dynamic function: The muscles enable movements of the trunk around three axes
        - Dorsiflexion
        - Lateral flexion
        - Rotation
    - Static function: Together with the band apparatus, they serve to tension the vertebrae with each other.

### Differences between indigenous and non-indigenous spinal musculature

| **Muscle Type** | **Autogenous Muscles**               | **Non-autogenous Muscles**          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Development** | Origin on site                       | Secondarily migrated                |
| **Location**    | Deep                                 | Superficial                         |
| **Innervation** | Posterior ramus of the spinal nerves | Anterior ramus of the spinal nerves |

## Non-autochthonous short neck muscles

The two muscles, Mm. rectus capitis lateralis and anterior, are topographically part of the prevertebral musculature of the neck, but in terms of origin and function, they are considered non-autochthonous short neck muscles.

|M. rectus capitis lateralis|- Transverse process of the atlas|- Occipital bone|- Unilaterally: Lateral bending of the head to the same side<br>- Bilaterally: Maintenance (stabilization) of the head|- Anterior ramus of the spinal nerve C1|
|M. rectus capitis anterior|- Atlas|- Occipital bone|- Unilaterally: Lateral flexion of the head to the same side<br>- Bilaterally: Ventral flexion of the head|
## Native Back Musculature

The intrinsic back muscles are divided into a medial and a lateral tract based on their position and innervation, and collectively they are referred to as the M. erector spinae.

- Medial tract: Between the spinous and transverse processes of the vertebrae, innervated by the medial branch of the posterior ramus of the spinal nerve.
    - Spinal System
    - Transversospinales System

    - Sacrospinal System
    - Spinotransversales System
    - Intertransversales System

### Medial tract of the autochthonous back muscles

The medial tract is further divided into two systems by the course of its muscles: a spinal system and a transversospinal system.

### Thoracolumbar fascia

The thoracolumbar fascia is a connective tissue sheath that consists of two layers and surrounds the intrinsic back muscles. Together with the vertebral arches as well as the spinous and transverse processes, it forms the osteofibrous canal in which the intrinsic back muscles lie, separating them from the migrated back muscles, serving as an origin for numerous muscles. It facilitates the interplay of the different muscles during trunk movement.

- Superficial layer
    - Fastening
        - Caudal: Iliac crest, Dorsal surface of the sacrum
        - Medial: Transverse processes
        - Cranial: Transitions into the deep layer of the nuchal fascia.
    - Origin for M. latissimus dorsi, M. serratus posterior inferior, and M. gluteus maximus
- Deep lamina
    - Location: Envelops the intrinsic back muscles from the ventral side and lies on the dorsal side of the M. quadratus lumborum.
    - Attachment: Iliac crest, costal processes of the lumbar vertebrae, 12th rib
    - Origin of the internal oblique muscle and the transversus abdominis muscle
## Non-native back muscles

The non-autochthonous back muscles consist of three groups: The spinoscapular and spinohumeral muscle groups are discussed under "Shoulder and Shoulder Girdle." The spinocostal muscles are treated in the following table. Strictly speaking, the Mm. intertransversarii anteriores cervicis and lumborum laterales also belong to the non-autochthonous back muscles.

## Topography

### Surface Anatomy of the Back

On the lower back of a woman, the so-called Michaelis diamond can be recognized, and in men, the so-called sacral triangle can be seen.

| **Feature**                  | **Michaelis Rhombus (Venus Rhombus)**                                             | **Sacral Triangle (Trigonum Sacrale)**                          |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Limitations (Boundaries)** | Four key points:<br>- Spinous process (LWK 4)<br>- Left posterior superior iliac spine<br>- Right posterior superior iliac spine<br>- Beginning of the gluteal fold (=Rima ani, Crena analis) | Three key points:<br>- Left posterior superior iliac spine<br>- Right posterior superior iliac spine<br>- Beginning of the gluteal fold (=Rima ani, Crena analis) |

> [!NOTE] Michaelis-Raute in obstetrics
> The Michaelis diamond is named after the German gynecologist Gustav Michaelis. The shape of the Michaelis diamond should be assessed in pregnant women as part of the clinical examination, as it allows conclusions to be drawn about the width of the female pelvis and thus the shape of the birth canal. If the diamond is particularly asymmetrical or overly elongated, this indicates a constricted pelvis and potentially a more difficult birth.

### Layer structure of the neck

The soft tissue of the neck consists of the following layers from the surface to the depth:

- Skin

    - Mm. splenius cervicis and capitis
    - M. semispinalis capitis
    - Mm. longissimus cervicis et capitis
    - Autochthonous short neck muscles

### Deep Nuchal Triangle (= Suboccipital Triangle)

- Limitations
    - After cranial: M. rectus capitis posterior major
    - After caudal: M. obliquus capitis inferior

    - N. suboccipitalis
## Review Questions on the Chapter Neck and Back
### Musculature of the Spine

How can the muscles of the spine be classified?
- The musculature of the spine is divided into the short neck muscles (autochthonous vs. non-autochthonous) and the back musculature (autochthonous vs. non-autochthonous). Non-autochthonous muscles have migrated secondarily and lie superficially, autochthonous muscles developed in place and lie deep.

### Autochthonous short neck muscles

Which neck muscles allow for a rotation of the head to the ipsilateral side with unilateral contraction and a dorsal extension of the head with bilateral contraction?
- The M. rectus capitis posterior major and the M. obliquus capitis inferior belong to the autochthonous short neck muscles. With unilateral contraction, they enable a rotation of the head to the ipsilateral side and with bilateral contraction a dorsal extension of the head.

### Native Back Musculature

Which two muscles form the sacrospinal system of the lateral tract of the intrinsic back muscles?
- The sacrospinal system of the lateral tract of the autochthonous back musculature is formed by the M. iliocostalis (cervicis, thoracis, lumborum) and the M. longissimus (capitis, cervicis, thoracis).

Which two muscles form the spinotransverse system of the lateral tract of the intrinsic back muscles? How does the system run?
- The spinotransverse system of the lateral tract of the autochthonous back musculature is formed by the M. splenius capitis and the M. splenius cervicis. It originates at the Procc. spinosi and inserts at the Procc. transversi and at the Os occipitale/Proc. mastoideus.
