# Forearm
## Summary

The bony framework of the forearm consists of the ulna and the radius, which are interconnected at the radioulnar joint. The forearm is connected to the humerus via the elbow joint, and to the hand through the wrist. Numerous muscles of the forearm enable precise movements of the hand. The highly variable vessels of the forearm have caused many medical students frustration when searching for a puncture site for venous blood draws, venous access, or arterial punctures.
## Bones

### Ulna (=Ulna)

The ulna can be divided from proximal to distal into the following important sections and structures.

- Proximal Epiphysis
    - Olecranon
    - Coronoid process
    - Radial notch
    - Trochlear notch
    - Ulnar tuberosity
- Body of the ulna (Ulnar shaft)
- Head of the ulna (Ulnar head)
    - Styloid process of the ulna
    - Articular circumference

### Radius (=Radius)

The radius can be divided from proximal to distal into the following important sections and structures.

- Head of the radius (Radius head)
- Corpus radii (Radiusschaft)
    - Radial tuberosity
- Distal Epiphysis
    - Styloid process of the radius
    - Carpal articular surface
    - Ulnar notch
    - Dorsal tubercle

> [!NOTE] Distal Radius Fracture
> The distal radius fracture is the most common fracture in adults, accounting for 25% of all fractures. The most common cause is a fall on an outstretched hand (known as a Colles fracture). Therapeutically, after repositioning, usually immobilization in a plaster cast for 4–6 weeks is sufficient.

## Joints and Ligaments

### Radioulnar Joint

The radioulnar joint consists of a proximal and a distal part. Both are pivot joints and form a functional unit for the pronation and supination of the hand. The proximal radioulnar joint also belongs to the three-part elbow joint see: humerus and elbow. The joint between radius, ulna and proximal carpal bones is discussed in the topic → wrist (chapter “hand”).

- Definition: Functional unit consisting of proximal and distal radioulnar joint
- Function
    - 1 degree of freedom: Pronation/Supination (90°/0°/90°)
- Joint Type: Ball Joint
- Involved structures of the proximal joint
    - Bony: The articular circumference of the head of the radius articulates with the ulna at the radial notch.
    - Connective tissue: Lig. anulare radii (ring-shaped band)
        - The origin and approach is each the radial notch of the ulna.
- Involved structures of the distal joint
    - Bony: The articular circumference of the head of the ulna is adjacent to the radius in the ulnar notch
    - Connective tissue
        - Loose joint capsule that allows for the comprehensive movement of pronation/supination
        - Palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments

> [!NOTE]
> SUPination is the movement used to scoop soup! PROnation brings the back of the hand up like when slicing bread!

### Interosseous membrane of the forearm

- Definition: Connective tissue connection between the opposing longitudinal edges of the radius and ulna (interosseous margin of the radius/ulna)
- Function
    - Prevents longitudinal shifting of the radius and ulna against each other (stabilization of the radioulnar joint)
    - In supination (when the bones lie parallel to each other) it is tense
    - With pronation, it is relaxed.
- Other involved structures: Proximally, it is reinforced by a chorda obliqua that runs opposite to the direction of the fibers.
## Muscles

The muscles of the forearm can be divided into the ventral group of flexors and the dorsal group of extensors. Both groups can also be further subdivided into superficial and deep muscle groups. The individual groups are separated from each other by fascial bands.

### Flexors of the Forearm

#### Superficial Flexors of the Forearm

The muscles are arranged in the table from radial to ulnar.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|

> [!NOTE]
> The M. pronator teres is the primary muscle of the N. medianus, while the M. flexor carpi ulnaris is associated with the N. ulnaris!

> [!NOTE]
> You place the left thumb on the origin of the superficial flexors (medial epicondyle of the humerus) and the rest of the hand on the forearm, resulting in the following arrangement from radial to ulnar: Pass-Fail-Pass-Fail: Index finger = pronator teres; Middle finger = flexor carpi radialis; Ring finger = palmaris longus; Little finger = flexor carpi ulnaris!

#### Deep flexors of the forearm

The muscles were arranged according to their origin from proximal to distal.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. flexor digitorum profundus|- Palmar Ulnar<br>- Interosseous membrane|- Distal Phalanges II-V|- Wrist: Flexion<br>- Base, middle, and distal joints of fingers 2–5: Flexion|- N. median: 2nd finger<br>- N. ulnar: 5th finger<br>- Common innervation: 3rd and 4th fingers|

> [!NOTE]
> The median nerve runs between the superficial and deep flexor groups and innervates all flexors of the forearm, except for the flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar part of the flexor digitorum profundus, which are both innervated by the ulnar nerve!

### Extensors of the Forearm

In the extensors, in addition to the radial group, one can also distinguish between the superficial and deep groups. The radial group is located immediately lateral to the radius.

#### Radial Group

All muscles of the radial group originate from the humerus and are listed below according to their origin from proximal to distal. The M. brachioradialis is the key muscle for the radial vascular-nervous pathway: Between its tendon insertion and the tendon of the M. flexor carpi radialis, the A. radialis (pulse palpable here) and the R. superficialis of the N. radialis (sensitive finger innervation) run.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. brachioradialis|- Lateral margin of the humerus<br>- Lateral intermuscular septum|- Styloid process of the radius|- Elbow joint: Flexion<br>- Radioulnar joint: Bringing about the midpoint between pronation/supination|- are innervated by the radial nerve|
|M. extensor carpi radialis longus|- Lateral epicondyle of the humerus<br>- Annular ligament of the radius|- Metacarpal bone II|- Wrist joints<br>    - Dorsal extension<br>    - Radial abduction<br>- Elbow joint: Flexion|
|M. extensor carpi radialis brevis|- Lateral epicondyle of the humerus|- Metacarpal bone III|

#### Superficial extensors of the forearm

The superficial extensors have a common origin at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and are sorted from radial to ulnar according to their insertion on the hand.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. extensor digitorum|- Lateral epicondyle of the humerus|- Dorsal aponeuroses 2nd–5th fingers|- Hand- and finger joints<br>    - Dorsiflexion<br>    - Ulnar abduction|- N. radialis|
|M. extensor digiti minimi|- Dorsal aponeurosis 5. Finger|
|M. extensor carpi ulnaris|- Lateral epicondyle of the humerus (Common head)<br>- Dorsal side of the ulna (Ulnar head)|- Metacarpal bone V|- Wrist joints<br>    - Ulnar abduction<br>    - Dorsal extension|

> [!NOTE]
> The superficial flexors originate from the medial epicondyle, while the superficial extensors originate from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus!

> [!NOTE] Radial humerus epicondylitis  
> In the so-called tennis elbow, pain occurs at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. Due to excessive strain on the superficial extensors of the forearm, the tendons of the muscles originating there become irritated and hurt.

#### Deep Extensors of the Forearm

The deep extensors are sorted by their origin from proximal to distal. The M. supinator is the primary muscle of the N. radialis.

|Name|Origin|Approach|Function|Innervation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|M. supinator|- Lateral epicondyle of the humerus<br>- Olecranon of the ulna<br>- Radial collateral ligament<br>- Annular ligament of the radius|- Radius|- Radioulnar joint: Supination|- Innervated by the radial nerve|
|M. abductor pollicis longus|- Dorsal surfaces of ulna, radius, and interosseous membrane|- Os metacarpi I|- Thumb saddle joint<br>    - Abduction<br>    - Extension<br>- Wrist joints<br>    - Radial abduction|
|M. extensor pollicis brevis|- Phalanx proximal I|
|M. extensor pollicis longus|- Dorsal side of ulna and interosseous membrane|- Distal phalanx I|- Carpometacarpal joint of the thumb<br>    - Adduction<br>    - Extension<br>- Wrist joints<br>    - Extension<br>    - Radial abduction|
|M. extensor indicis|- Dorsal aponeurosis of the 2nd finger|- 2. Finger joint: Extension<br>- Wrist joints: Extension|

> [!NOTE]
> All extensors of the forearm are innervated by the radial nerve!

> [!NOTE] Supinator syndrome
> In this relatively rare compression syndrome, the motor branch (Ramus profundus) of the N. radialis is pinched in the supinator tunnel between the two muscle heads of the M. supinator, leading primarily to weakness of the finger extensors. Causes may include trauma or overuse of the M. supinator.

## Review Questions for the Chapter on the Forearm
### Muscles

In what groups can the muscles of the forearm be categorized?
- The muscles of the forearm can be divided into a ventral (flexors) and a dorsal group (extensors). Each of these two groups can be further divided into a superficial and a deep muscle group. Among the extensors of the forearm, in addition to the superficial and deep groups, the radial group can also be distinguished.
What movements are caused by the contraction of the M. pronator teres?
- The M. pronator teres causes flexion at the elbow joint and pronation at the radioulnar joint.
Which muscles in the forearm are innervated by the median nerve?
- The median nerve innervates all the superficial flexors of the forearm (M. flexor digitorum superficialis, M. pronator teres, M. flexor carpi radialis, M. palmaris longus) except for the M. flexor carpi ulnaris, which is innervated by the ulnar nerve. Among the deep flexors, it supplies the M. flexor pollicis longus, the M. pronator quadratus, and the M. flexor digitorum profundus of the 2nd finger alone as well as those of the 3rd and 4th fingers jointly with the ulnar nerve (only the M. flexor digitorum profundus of the 5th finger is innervated solely by the ulnar nerve).
Which muscle allows for a flexion of the distal joints of the 2nd to 4th fingers?
- The contraction of the M. flexor digitorum profundus leads to flexion in the distal joint of fingers 2–4.
Which muscles in the forearm are innervated by the radial nerve?
- The M. pronator teres is the guiding muscle of the median nerve, the M. flexor carpi ulnaris that of the ulnar nerve.
Which guiding muscles are associated with the ulnar nerve and the median nerve?
- The M. pronator teres is the guiding muscle of the median nerve, the M. flexor carpi ulnaris that of the ulnar nerve.
What is the so-called supinator syndrome?
- In the rather rare supinator syndrome, the motor branch (ramus profundus) of the radial nerve is compressed in the supinator tunnel between the two muscle heads of the M. supinator, which mainly leads to weakness of the finger extensors.
