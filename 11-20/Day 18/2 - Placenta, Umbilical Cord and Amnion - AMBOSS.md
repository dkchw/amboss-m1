# Placenta, Umbilical Cord and Amnion
## Summary

The prenatal protection and care structures include, in particular, the placenta, amniotic cavity, umbilical cord, and fetal membranes. The placenta has the most important function: as a fetomaternal organ, it enables the exchange of substances and gases between the mother and fetus. The development of the uteroplacental circulation involves several steps, which are associated with the transformation of the endometrium as well as the invasion of fetal placental portions into the maternal uterine lining. The mature placenta then exhibits a characteristic structure with fetal and maternal components. Through the placental barrier, the embryo is protected from direct contact with maternal blood. This ensures that only selectively nutrients and gases are transferred between mother and fetus, and both sides are protected from harmful substances. In addition, the placenta produces many hormones that are responsible, among other things, for the adaptation of the maternal organism to pregnancy and the maintenance of pregnancy.
## Training of the Uteroplacental Circulation

After the implantation of the embryo into the uterine lining on the 6th day of embryonic development, some changes occur on the maternal and fetal sides with the formation of the uteroplacental circulation. For implantation to take place and for the embryo to be nourished in the early stages, the uterine lining must first transform into the nutrient-rich decidua. Additionally, the embryo differentiates into embryoblast and trophoblast even before implantation. From the trophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast develop as early embryonic placental structures that invade the decidua. Although the development of the placenta begins before implantation, the nourishment of the embryo only starts from the 12th day through the maternal blood. It is only then that the fetal vessels (through the opening of maternal vessels) come into contact with maternal blood, resulting in the formation of the fetomaternal exchange zone.

### Decidual Reaction

- Definition: Changes that the pregnancy endometrium (decidua) undergoes during implantation.
- Goal
    - Nutrition of the seed: Storage of fat and glycogen (→ Cell enlargement)
        - Secretion of lytic enzymes by syncytiotrophoblasts during invasion into the uterine mucosa → Uptake of nutrients by the syncytiotrophoblast for the nourishment of the embryo
    - Immunological shielding of the germ: Formation of tight junctions that isolate the implantation site from the rest of the endometrial tissue (immunologically privileged space)
    - Preparation of the placental circulation: The vessels of the decidua transform under the influence of progesterone into a network of anastomosing spiral arteries.

### Dezidua

The decidua later forms the maternal part of the placenta and can be divided into three sections based on its relationship to the implantation site:

- Decidua basalis: Forms the maternal part of the placenta
- Decidua capsularis: Portion of the decidua that forms a cap-like structure over the embryo after interstitial implantation.
- Decidua parietalis: Remaining endometrial mucosa that lines the uterus outside the implantation site.

### Nutrition of the Germ

The nutrition of the germ is closely related to placental development.

- Histiotrophe Phase
    - Before the 12th day of embryonic development
    - Nutrition through nutrients that have been absorbed by the syncytiotrophoblast through the lysis of decidual cells.
- Hematotropic Phase
    - Starting from the 12th day of embryonic development
    - Beginning of the uteroplacental circulation
    - There is contact between the syncytiotrophoblast and the maternal circulation through the blood-filled lacunae.
    - Nutrient supply comes from the maternal blood

### Placentation

Prerequisite for placentation is the differentiation of the embryonal cell mass into the bilaminar germ disc during the pre-implantation phase. The germ disc consists of embryoblast and trophoblast. Upon implantation, the trophoblast further differentiates into syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast, from which the placenta later develops.

- Goal: Exchange of substances and gases between mother and child through the blood
- Stadiums
    - Compact Stadium
        - 1. Development Week
        - Syncytiotrophoblasts grow as a compact layer of cells finger-like into the decidua basalis.
    - Lacunar Stadium
        - Starting from the 9th day of embryonic development
        - Lacunae form in the syncytiotrophoblast, which are only separated by narrow syncytiotrophoblast trabeculae.
        - The lytic enzymes of the syncytiotrophoblast erode the spiral arteries of the decidua, causing the lacunae to fill with maternal blood.
        - In the course of development, the lacunae merge and form the intervillous space.

### Formation and Maturation of the Chorionic Villi

During the maturation of the placenta, the chorionic villi change their composition. The relatively simply constructed primary villi become tertiary villi, which are capable of gas and nutrient exchange and connect to the umbilical cord.

- Goal: As effective a gas and nutrient exchange as possible
- Process
    - Primary chorion plate: syncytiotrophoblast and the adjacent cytotrophoblast
    - Secondary chorion plate: Syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast as well as extraembryonic mesoderm
        - It arises from the immigration of the extraembryonic mesoderm, which attaches to the cytotrophoblast layer at the end of the 2nd week.
    - Primary villi: Formed by the immigration of cytotrophoblast cells into the syncytiotrophoblast trabeculae.
        - Structure
            - Nucleus from cytotrophoblast cells
            - Outer syncytiotrophoblast layer
    - Secondary villi: Formed by the immigration of mesoderm cells into the center of the primary villi.
        - Structure
            - Mesodermal nucleus
            - Continuous layer of cytotrophoblast cells
            - Syncytiotrophoblast layer with microvilli
    - Tertiary villi: Connect to the umbilical vessels during the third week.
        - Formation through the development of capillaries in the secondary villi (differentiation of mesoderm cells in the core of the villi)
        - Tertiary zygotes before the 4th month
            - Structure
                - Differentiated mesodermal nucleus with juvenile capillaries
                - Continuous layer of cytotrophoblast cells
                - Syncytiotrophoblast layer
        - Tertiary villi from the 4th month: Cytotrophoblast slowly disappears from the tertiary villi → Only a few isolated cytotrophoblast cells (so-called Langhans cells) remain.
            - The disappearance of the continuous layer of cytotrophoblast cells maximally shortens the diffusion distance between fetal and maternal blood.
            - Structure
                - Differentiated mesodermal nucleus with juvenile capillaries
                - Isolated cytotrophoblast cells (Langhans cells)
                - Syncytiotrophoblast layer
## The Mature Placenta

### Structure of the Placenta

The mature, disc-shaped placenta measures approximately 20 cm in diameter and weighs about 500 g. With a blood flow of 500–750 mL/min, it accounts for about 10–15% of the maternal cardiac output towards the end of pregnancy. It can be divided into three areas:

- Basal plate (predominantly maternal contribution)
- Intervillous space and chorionic villi (fetomaternal zone)
- Chorion plate (fetal part)

#### Basal plate

- Definition: Predominantly maternal portion of the placenta that lies against the uterine wall.
    - Structure: Maternal decidua with some embedded embryonic cells (cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast cells)
        - Placental septa: They protrude as extensions of the basal plate at certain points into the intervillous space.
        - Cotyledon: 10–40 areas, in which the basal plate is divided on the uterine side.

#### Intervillous Space and Chorial Villus Trees

- Intervillous space
    - Space filled with maternal blood and in which the fetal villi trees protrude
    - Contact zone between maternal and fetal placental structures → Site of fetomaternal gas and substance exchange
- Chorionic villi: The placenta consists of 30-50 highly branched chorionic villi.
    - Chorionic villi: Basal area of the villous trees with fetal arteries and veins
    - Intermediate villi: Area of the villous trees with fetal arterioles, venules, and capillaries
    - Terminal villi: End villi with capillaries that float freely in the intervillous space. They are directly involved in the fetomaternal gas and nutrient exchange.
    - Haftzotten: Attachment of the villi to the decidua
        - The cytotrophoblast of the anchoring villi expands and pushes itself between the decidua and the syncytiotrophoblast.

#### Chorion plate

- Definition: Fetal part of the placenta
- Structure: Formed by syncytiotrophoblast, cytotrophoblast, and the parietal layer of the extraembryonic mesoderm.
    - Chorion frondosum: Hair-bearing chorion that is involved in placental formation.
    - Chorion laeve: Smooth chorion corresponding to the middle egg membrane.

### Placental Barrier

Maternal and fetal circulation are separated by several cell layers (the so-called placental barrier). The placental barrier controls gas and nutrient exchange. While it consists of 5 layers until the 4th month, the cytotrophoblast disappears from the villous wall afterwards, and only a few cytotrophoblast cells (Langhans cells) remain.

- Development until the 4th month (from maternal to fetal)
    1. Syncytiotrophoblast
    2. Cytotrophoblast
    3. Basal lamina of the trophoblast
    4. Connective tissue villous stroma
    5. Basement membrane of the endothelium
    6. Capillary endothelium
- Development from the 4th month (from maternal to fetal)
    1. Syncytiotrophoblast
    2. Merged basal laminae of trophoblast and endothelium
    3. Capillary endothelium

> [!NOTE]
> After birth, it must be checked whether the placenta has completely detached from the uterine lining, as otherwise there is a risk of postpartum bleeding. This is done by assessing the completeness of the cotyledons on the maternal side. On the fetal side, the placenta should be covered by the amnion!

> [!NOTE] Placental abruption
> For placental separation disorders, there are many causes. One reason for the development of severe bleeding complications is the faulty formation of the cytotrophoblast shell. If the trophoblast penetrates too deeply (e.g., placenta accreta), it leads to problems with placental separation. If the penetration depth is too shallow, it can result in premature placental separation with the formation of a retroplacental hematoma.

## The Function of the Placenta

### Hormone Production

- Place of education: Syncytiotrophoblast
- Function
    - Maintenance of pregnancy
    - Adaptation of the maternal organism to pregnancy
    - Regulation of uterine blood flow
    - Promotion of the child's development and growth
    - Introduction of birth
- Produced hormones: The most important hormones include HCG, HPL, CRH, estrogen, and progesterone, which will be briefly overviewed below (For a detailed overview of the hormones during pregnancy, see also: Hormonal situation during pregnancy)

|Hormone|Place of Formation|Effect|Course|
|---|---|---|---|
|HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)|- Syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta|- Maintenance of pregnancy and assumption of LH function<br>    - Formation and maintenance of the corpus luteum of pregnancy<br>    - Stimulation of progesterone and estrogen synthesis of the corpus luteum of pregnancy|- Rapid increase of β-HCG in early pregnancy<br>    - Maximum concentration around 10 weeks of gestation|
|HPL (Human Placental Lactogen)|- Syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta|- Similarity to the growth hormone somatotropin<br>- Increase in insulin resistance in the maternal circulation|- Constant increase until the 34th week of pregnancy (end of placental growth)|
|CRH (Corticotropin-releasing hormone)|- Syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta|- Unclear, may play a role in the timing of birth|- Increase in concentration during pregnancy or in response to maternal stress|
|Estrogen|- Until about the 10th week of pregnancy: Corpus luteum of pregnancy<br>- From about the 10th week of pregnancy: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is produced as a precursor mainly in the fetal (partly also maternal) adrenal cortex → Conversion to estrogen in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta|- Growth hormone<br>- Anabolic effect<br>- Increase in the wall thickness of the uterus<br>- Proliferation and differentiation of the mammary glands|- Constant increase throughout the course of pregnancy|
|Progesterone|- Until approximately the 10th week of pregnancy: Corpus luteum of pregnancy (Thecalutein and Granulosalutein cells)<br>- From about the 10th week of pregnancy: Syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta derived from maternal cholesterol|- Maintenance of pregnancy<br>    - Transformation from proliferative to secretory endometrium<br>    - Maintenance of the endometrium<br>    - Postovulatory closure of the cervix and thickening of cervical mucus<br>    - Decreased tone of the uterus, inhibition of contractility<br>    - Increased proliferation and secretion readiness of the mammary glands|- Steady increase throughout the course of pregnancy|

### Gas and Substance Exchange

- Passive Transport
    - Simple diffusion: O2, CO2, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, water, medications
    - Facilitated diffusion: Glucose, Lactate
- Active Transport: Amino acids, peptides, hormones, vitamins, fatty acids, inorganic ions
    - Pinocytosis: Proteins, Lipids, Antibodies (IgG)

> [!NOTE]
> Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), immunoglobulins (except IgG), and most proteins can only partially or not at all cross the placental barrier. As an important cofactor for blood clotting, vitamin K should therefore be supplemented to the newborn immediately after birth!

> [!NOTE]
> Unfortunately, some potentially teratogenic substances such as ethanol or the anti-D antibodies of the rhesus system can pass through the placenta barrier as IgG antibodies. However, the isoagglutinins of the ABO system are primarily plasma IgM antibodies, for which passage is not possible!

> [!NOTE] Passive immunity (nest protection)
> From the 20th week of pregnancy, the transplacental transport of IgG antibodies begins. The concentration of IgG antibodies in fetal blood increases with gestational age, so that the protection against infections is greatest towards the end of pregnancy. This provides the newborn with passive immunity against certain pathogens. Premature infants, accordingly, have only insufficient passive immunity. If IgM antibodies are detected in the blood of the newborn, this is more indicative of an intrauterine infection, as the placental barrier is impermeable to IgM. Through breastfeeding, additional immunoglobulins (especially IgA) can also be transferred to the newborn via breast milk. Thus, passive immunity can also be enhanced after birth. Passive immunity serves as protection against infections in the newborn during the first weeks to months, as the infant's own adaptive immune system is not yet fully developed.

## The Umbilical Cord

The umbilical cord represents the vital connection between the embryo and the placenta. Through it, the child is connected to the uteroplacental circulation and is supplied with nutrients and gases. At birth, its length is about 50–70 cm. It normally attaches centrally to the chorionic plate of the placenta. Due to the expansion of the amniotic cavity, there is an aggregation of several structures during the 4th to 8th week.

### Formation and Structure of the Umbilical Cord

#### Components of the early umbilical cord

- Haftstiel: Precursor of the mature umbilical cord
- Allantois
    - In the third week, a small protrusion forms from the wall of the yolk sac into the attachment stalk.
    - At the transition from allantois epithelium to the endoderm of the hindgut, the urinary bladder forms.
- Vessels: 3 vessels that exclusively carry juvenile blood
    - 2 Umbilical arteries (= Aa. umbilicales): branches of the internal iliac arteries, carry oxygen-poor blood from the fetus to the placenta
    - 1 Umbilical vein (= V. umbilicalis): Runs from the placenta toward the fetal liver and carries oxygen-rich and nutrient-rich blood.
- Vitelline duct: Connects the midgut with the remnants of the yolk sac.
- Yolk sac vessels: Blood supply of the yolk sac

#### Components of the mature umbilical cord

- Basic substance: Gelatinous connective tissue (Wharton's jelly)
- Membrane: Amniotic epithelium
- Content
    - Umbilical vessels
    - Remains of the obliterated vitelline duct
    - Urachus

> [!NOTE]
> The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood, while the umbilical veins carry oxygenated blood!

### Physiological Umbilical Hernia

Due to the rapid growth of the abdominal organs, there is temporarily insufficient space in the embryonic body cavity → Displacement of intestinal portions into the extraembryonic coelom of the later umbilical cord from the 6th to the 10th week of development.
## Amniotic Cavity and Egg Membranes

### Amniotic Cavity

The amniotic cavity develops very early in pregnancy and surrounds the embryo as a protective envelope. As the embryo grows, the amniotic cavity also expands, leading to the obliteration of other cavities.

- Origin: Already in the 2nd week of development through the emigration of epiblast cells (see above)
- Content
    - Covered by amniotic epithelium
    - Filled with amniotic fluid produced by the amnion epithelium
- Consequences of Childhood Growth
    - Obliteration of the chorionic cavity: In parallel with the fetus, the enclosing amniotic cavity also grows → the chorionic cavity is increasingly filled until it is finally obliterated.
    - Obliteration of the uterine cavity: Due to the rapid fetal growth, the decidua capsularis surrounding the fetus also approaches the decidua parietalis of the uterine wall → merging of the two decidual layers, so that the amniotic cavity fills the entire uterine cavity by about the fourth month.

For more information on amniotic fluid, see Amniotic Fluid Anomalies → Amniotic Fluid.

### Eihäute

As amniotic membranes, one refers to the embryonic coverings that enclose the embryo, consisting of maternal and fetal components. They merge together during the course of pregnancy and provide mechanical protection for the embryo. Colloquially, they are also referred to as the amniotic sac.

1. Amnion: Inner membrane,
    - Is formed by the embryoblast and secretes the amniotic fluid.
2. Chorion: Intermediate egg membrane,
    - Is formed by the cytotrophoblast
3. Decidua: Outer egg membrane,
    - Is formed by the uterine decidua capsularis, which lies above the implantation site.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Placenta, Umbilical Cord, and Amnion
### Training of the Uteroplacental Circulation

Describe the structure of tertiary tufts!
- Tertiary villi project freely into the intervillous space and arise through the formation of capillaries in the secondary villi. They consist of the mesenchymal core with fetal capillaries as well as isolated cytotrophoblast cells (Langhans cells) and the syncytiotrophoblast layer, which is in contact with maternal blood.
### The mature placenta

In what three areas can the mature placenta be divided?
- From the 4th month onwards, the placenta consists of the basal plate, which lies adjacent to the uterine wall (maternal part), the intervillous space, into which the fetal villous trees project (site of feto-maternal gas exchange), and the chorionic plate (fetal part).
What layers make up the mature placenta barrier?
- The placental barrier separates maternal and fetal circulation through several cell layers. The outer layer (facing the maternal layer) is formed by the syncytiotrophoblasts. The fetal capillary endothelium forms the inner layer, i.e., the layer facing the fetus. In between lie the fused basal laminae of the capillary endothelium and the syncytiotrophoblasts, which form the middle layer.
What hormones are produced in the syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta?
- The syncytiotrophoblasts of the chorionic plate produce HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), HPL (human placental lactogen), and CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone). From about the 10th week of pregnancy onwards, the syncytiotrophoblasts also take over the production of progesterone (before that: corpus luteum graviditatis).
When can the highest HCG concentration in the blood of a pregnant woman be measured?
- HCG experiences a rapid increase in early pregnancy. Its maximum concentration is reached around the 10th week of pregnancy and then continuously decreases.
Why can rhesus antibodies pass through the placental barrier, while antibodies of the ABO system cannot?
- Rhesus antibodies, like all IgG antibodies, can pass the placental barrier relatively unrestricted. ABO antibodies belong to the IgM antibodies, for which passage is not possible.
### The Umbilical Cord

What substance is the umbilical cord made of?
- The mature umbilical cord consists of gelatinous connective tissue (Wharton's jelly), which prevents bending of the umbilical cord.
### Amniotic Cavity and Egg Membranes

What are the amniotic membranes? What three layers are distinguished?
- The egg membranes, meaning the membranes surrounding the embryo, are also called the amniotic sac. The inner membrane adjacent to the embryo is the amnion, the middle layer is the chorion, and the outer layer facing the mother is the decidua.
