# Esophagus
## Summary

The esophagus is a tubular hollow organ that transports food from the mouth to the stomach. It is divided into three sections and also has three physiological constrictions. A complex closure mechanism seals the esophagus from the stomach. Histologically, the esophagus is structured like the other organs of the gastrointestinal tract, with the exception of some specifics. By the way, you can also find a histo trainer episode on the esophagus in the section on microscopic anatomy.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function: Transport of food
- Location: Begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx and ends with the entrance into the stomach.
- Shape: Tubular
- Length: 25–30 cm

### Topography

- Course
    - C6-C7: Transition from the pharynx to the esophagus (esophageal opening = upper esophageal sphincter)
        - Pulls between the trachea and the spine into the thorax
    - Th4: The aorta is located to the left of the esophagus (aortic narrowing)
        - Continues through the posterior mediastinum
            - Links: Aorta
            - Right: Right lung
            - Ventral: Linker Atria
            - Dorsal: Spine
    - Th10: The esophagus passes together with the vagal trunks through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm (= diaphragm opening)
        - Pulls on the left liver lobe caudally
    - Th11: Esophagus opens into the stomach

### Structure

The esophagus is a muscular tube that is divided into three sections based on its position. Along its course, the esophagus has three constrictions that are caused by its relationships with neighboring structures. At the lower end of the esophagus, a combination of various mechanisms is responsible for closing the esophagus at the entrance to the stomach (= Pars cardiaca); there is no true sphincter muscle.

#### Sections

1. Cervical part of the esophagus (= neck section)
    - Length: 7–8 cm
    - Course: From the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage to the upper thoracic aperture
2. Thoracic part of the esophagus (= chest part)
    - Length: 16 cm
    - Course: From the upper thoracic aperture to the diaphragm passage
3. Abdominal part of the esophagus (= abdominal section)
    - Length: 1–3 cm
    - Course: From the diaphragm passage to the entrance into the stomach

> [!NOTE]
> The abdominal part of the esophagus (= Pars abdominalis) is located intraperitoneally!

> [!NOTE]
> The angle at which the abdominal part of the esophagus enters the stomach is called the "His angle"!

> [!NOTE]
> The esophageal mouth is the narrowest part of the esophagus and is also called the upper esophageal sphincter; it is a sphincter mechanism that is reinforced by a venous plexus!

#### Closure mechanism of the lower esophagus (= Lower esophageal sphincter, LES)

- Spiral arranged esophageal muscle layer
- Pressure gradient between the chest and abdominal cavity
- Angled entrance of the esophagus into the stomach (His angle)
- Venous plexus of the esophagus
- Zwerchfellenge
- Fixation of the esophageal end by the phrenicoesophageal ligament (= Laimer membrane)

> [!NOTE]
> In general, the closure mechanisms are referred to as the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). However, it is not a true sphincter, but rather a functional sphincter system!

> [!NOTE] Reflux esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus
> When the mechanism of the lower esophageal sphincter does not function properly, there is a backflow (= reflux) of gastric juice into the esophagus. The esophageal epithelium provides mechanical, but not chemical protection. Since gastric juice consists, among other things, of very aggressive hydrochloric acid, reflux can lead to esophagitis (= inflammation of the esophagus). This condition is called "reflux esophagitis." Symptoms of reflux esophagitis include retrosternal pain (= heartburn), which occurs mainly after eating and when lying down. If reflux esophagitis persists for a longer period of time, the normal esophageal epithelium (stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium) can transform into columnar epithelium (= metaplasia). Such a transformation is referred to as "Barrett's esophagus," on the basis of which dysplasias can develop as a precursor to a carcinoma.

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

The three sections of the esophagus are supplied by different vessels. Similarly, the lymphatic drainage varies depending on the section of the esophagus. Like all other parts of the intestinal tract, the esophagus is supplied by the autonomously functioning enteric nervous system. There is also sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation.

> [!NOTE] Esophageal varices
> Between the influence area of the inferior vena cava and the portal vein, there are collateral circulations (these are called "portocaval anastomoses"). If the blood flow into the portal vein is obstructed (e.g., due to liver cirrhosis), the blood bypasses the liver and backs up into the collateral circulations. It then drains, for example, through the veins of the esophagus into the superior vena cava. However, since these veins are not designed for such high pressure, they collapse. These dilated veins - so-called esophageal varices - can rupture and lead to life-threatening bleeding.

## Microscopic Anatomy

The esophagus shows a layering typical for the digestive tract: tunica mucosa, tela submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica adventitia or tunica serosa (see: overview of the digestive system). However, there are some particularities due to the strong mechanical stress on the esophagus.

- Characteristics of the esophagus
    - Epithelial layer of the mucosa: Stratified non-keratinized squamous epithelium
    - Lamina propria mucosae: Especially rich in collagen fibers
    - Muscularis mucosae: Particularly well-developed
    - Submucosal tissue
        - Pleated raised (reserve pleats)
        - Mucous glands (= esophageal glands)
    - Tunica muscularis: Only in the lower third of the esophagus is there smooth muscle, in the upper third is skeletal muscle, and in the middle third both types of muscle.

> [!NOTE]
> The thoracic part of the esophagus is surrounded by an adventitia and the abdominal part, due to its intraperitoneal location, is covered by a serosa!

> [!NOTE] Esophageal diverticulum
> The esophagus, like the rest of the digestive tract, has an inner circular muscle layer and an outer longitudinal muscle layer. This is not equally strong at all points in the esophagus. For instance, it is often absent on the dorsal side of the esophagus (lower edge of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, cricopharyngeal part), in the so-called Laimer triangle, and at the transition from the pharynx to the esophagus (between the fundiform part and the oblique part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle), known as the Killian triangle. Under increased pressure in the esophagus, mucosal protrusions (= pulsion diverticula) can occur at these two sites, where the tunica mucosa and the submucosal layer are pushed outwards by the muscle layer. Since not all wall layers are affected, these are referred to as "false diverticula" or "pseudodiverticula." If such a diverticulum occurs in the Killian triangle, it is called a Zenker diverticulum. Although it is treated as an esophageal diverticulum, anatomically it originates from the hypopharynx. "True diverticula," in which all wall layers protrude, occur independently of muscular weaknesses and are also called "traction diverticula."

## Function

The esophagus is responsible for transporting food from the throat to the stomach. In this process, a distinction must be made between liquid and solid food.

- Transport of liquids: "Spritzschluck"
    - Peristalsis: Slightly pronounced
    - Process: The liquid is pushed through the esophagus into the stomach by the stamping action of the tongue and the floor of the mouth.
- Transport of solid food: Coordination by the enteric nervous system and the vagus nerve
    - Peristalsis: Pronounced
    - Process
        1. N. vagus: Stretching of the UES
        2. Swallowing center in the brainstem: Formation of a peristaltic wave
        3. Myenteric plexus
1. Formation of secondary peristaltic waves due to the mechanical stretching of the esophagus
            2. Extension of the UÖS

## Review Questions on the Chapter Esophagus
### Macroscopic Anatomy

Where is the narrowest part of the esophagus located and what is it formed by?
- The narrowest part of the esophagus is the so-called esophageal opening, which is located at the level of the cricoid cartilage and is formed by a sphincter system consisting of muscle and submucosal venous plexus.

Which arteries give off esophageal rami for the blood supply of the esophagus?
- The inferior thyroid artery, aorta, and left gastric artery supply the esophagus via esophageal branches.

Through which vessels does the venous blood drainage occur from the individual sections of the esophagus?
- The venous drainage from the sections of the esophagus occurs respectively via esophageal veins. In the cervical part, these drain into the inferior thyroid vein, in the thoracic part into the azygos vein and hemiazygos vein, and in the abdominal part into the left gastric vein.

Which lymph nodes drain the abdominal part of the esophagus?
- The abdominal part of the esophagus is drained by the left gastric lymph nodes as well as by lymph nodes around the cardia. These further drain into the celiac lymph nodes.

What are portocaval anastomoses and what is their function?
- Portocaval anastomoses are physiological bypass circulations between the hepatic portal vein and the venae cavae. Through them, blood flow to the heart is guaranteed even in case of congestion of the hepatic portal vein (e.g., in liver cirrhosis).

What are esophageal varices and how do they develop?
- Esophageal varices are dilated veins in the wall of the esophagus. They develop when blood flow into the hepatic portal vein is impaired and the blood instead flows via the esophageal veins into the superior vena cava (so-called portocaval anastomosis). Since these veins are not designed for such high pressure, they bulge and can even rupture.

### Microscopic Anatomy

In which histological layer are the esophageal glands located?
- The mucous glands of the esophagus (Glandulae oesophageae) are located in the submucosal layer (Tela submucosa).
