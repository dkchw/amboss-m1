# Teeth
## Summary

The teeth are responsible for the chewing of food. Since all teeth are already formed during the embryonic period, there is a formation for 52 teeth at birth (20 milk teeth and 32 permanent teeth). First, the primary dentition grows, which begins to fall out around the age of 7 and is replaced by the permanent dentition. The teeth are located in the bony dental alveoli and are shaped differently according to their respective functions.

## Macroscopic Anatomy

### Profile

- Function
    - Incisor: Biting
    - Wisdom tooth: Tear off and hold on
    - Premolar: Chewing and grinding
    - Molar: Chewing and Grinding
- Location: In the bony tooth sockets
- Form
    - Incisor: Chisel-shaped
    - Fang: Pointed
    - Premolar: Cylindrical
    - Molar: Flat with several chewing bumps

### Structure

The milk teeth consist of 20 and the permanent teeth consist of 32. There are four different types of teeth: incisor (Dens incisivus), canine (Dens caninus), premolar (Dens premolaris or also called bicuspid), and molar (Dens molaris or also called molar).

#### Structure of the Dentition

Since the same teeth are located at the top and bottom, as well as on the right and left, the description is given as "4 ×".

- Milk teeth: Consists of 20 teeth
    - 4 × 2 incisors
    - 4 × 1 corner tooth
    - 4 × 2 milk moles
- Permanent dentition: Consists of 32 teeth, which are classified into replacement and growth teeth.
    - 4 × 2 incisors (replacement teeth)
    - 4 × 1 canine teeth (replacement teeth)
    - 4 × 2 premolars (replacement teeth)
    - 4 × 3 molars (permanent teeth)
- Dental chart: Clear representation of the dentition
    - Division of the dentition into quadrants: Numbering from the upper right to the lower right with the numbers 1–4 (1st digit)
    - Classification of teeth from mesial to distal with the numbers 1–8 (2nd digit)
        - Dental formula for permanent dentition
            - Right maxillary arch: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18
            - Left upper jaw series: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28
            - Left mandible series: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38
            - Right lower jaw series: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48

> [!NOTE]
> Before the breakthrough of the replacement teeth, the alveolar bones and the roots of the milk teeth are completely eliminated by osteoclasts (odontoclasts)!

> [!NOTE]
> In the milk teeth, the lower incisor erupts first, while in the permanent teeth, it is the first molar!

> [!NOTE]
> The milk teeth, in contrast to the permanent teeth, only have so-called milk molars in addition to the incisors and canines. During the change of teeth, the milk molars are replaced by the premolars. These are therefore also called replacement teeth, while the molars that are additionally formed are referred to as growth teeth!

##### Normal position of the dentition

- The teeth of the upper jaw are slightly angled outward and the teeth of the lower jaw are slightly angled inward.
    - The upper incisors are positioned in front of the lower incisors during the occlusion (neutral bite).
- Premolars and molars are offset from each other in such a way that each tooth articulates with two opposing ones.
    - There is the main antagonist (with whom he has the greatest interaction) and the secondary antagonist.
    - The plane on which the teeth meet during the final bite is called the occlusal plane – if a tooth is missing an antagonist, it can grow beyond this occlusal plane.

#### Structure of the Tooth

- Three dental sections
    1. Dental crown (Corona dentis)
    2. Tooth neck (Cervix dentis)
    3. Tooth root (Radix dentis)
- Pulp cavity (Cavitas dentis): In tooth crown and root canals
    - Dental pulp (Pulpa dentis): Soft tissue of the tooth consisting of gelatinous connective tissue, nerve fibers, and blood vessels.

### Topography

The teeth are located in the bony dental alveoli in the lower and upper jaw. There are special terms for describing the position of the teeth.

|Location designation|Location|
|---|---|
|- Vestibular<br>    - Buccal<br>    - Labial|- Facing the oral vestibule<br>    - Facing the cheek<br>    - Facing the lips|
|- Oral<br>    - Lingual<br>    - Palatinal|- Toward the oral cavity<br>    - Toward the tongue<br>    - Toward the palate|
|- Mesial|- Toward the midpoint of the dental arch|
|- Distal|- Faced towards the back end of the dental arch|
|- Apical|- Towards the root tip|
|- Cervical|- At the tooth neck|
|- Occlusal|- On the chewing surface|

### Vascular Supply and Innervation

The vessels and nerves pass through the foramen apicis dentis into the pulp cavity.

|Upper Jaw Teeth|   |Lower Jaw Teeth|
|---|---|---|
|Vessel Supply|   |   |
|Arterial|- A. superior alveolar from the A. maxillary|- A. inferior alveolar from the A. maxillary|
|Venous|- V. infraorbitalis into the V. facialis<br>- Other fine veins in the pterygoid plexus|- V. alveolaris inferior into the pterygoid plexus|
|Innervation|   |   |
|Sensory|- Superior alveolar nerves from the maxillary nerve|- Inferior alveolar nerve from the mandibular nerve|
|Lymphatic drainage|   |   |
|Lymph nodes|- Submandibular lymph nodes|- Submental lymph nodes<br>- Submandibular lymph nodes|

> [!NOTE]
> To numb the lower jaw for a dental treatment, the anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve is sufficient. The teeth of the upper jaw, on the other hand, are supplied by several nerve branches, so not all teeth of the upper jaw can be numbed at once!

## Microscopic Anatomy

The tooth consists of the so-called hard substances (dentin, enamel, cement) and the dental pulp. The periodontal apparatus (cement, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, gums) secures the teeth in the jaw. The main mass of the tooth is made up of dentin, which is covered by enamel at the crown and by cement at the root. In the area of the tooth neck, cement and enamel are adjacent to each other. The pulp cavity is filled with the dental pulp.

|Substances|Characteristics|
|---|---|
|Hart substances|   |
|Dentin (Tooth Substance)|- Formation: Initially formed (as predentin) by odontoblasts<br>    - The odontoblasts do not encase themselves in the predentin they produce, but instead release it "outwards" towards the enamel. The more predentin they form, the further they move towards the dental pulp<br>    - Through a withdrawal of water, the predentin mineralizes into dentin<br>- Function: Surrounds the pulp chamber and constitutes the majority of the tooth<br>- Composition: 70% minerals (hydroxyapatite crystals), 20% collagen fibrils (Type I), 10% water<br>- Special Feature: The odontoblasts release cytoplasmic extensions known as Tomes' fibers, which extend through the dentinal tubules and connect the dentin with the odontoblasts that nourish it (Dentin is thus a living tissue and can, in principle, be regenerated throughout life!)|
|Tooth Enamel (Enamelum)|- Formation: Formed by ameloblasts (adamantoblasts)<br>    - The ameloblasts release a so-called Tomes' process towards the enamel-dentin junction<br>    - The ameloblasts die off when the teeth erupt, which makes the tooth enamel acellular and non-repairable<br>- Function: Covers and protects the dentin at the crown<br>- Composition<br>    - 95% minerals (hydroxyapatite crystals), 1% proteins, and 4% water<br>    - Contains no cells, nerves, vessels, or collagen fibers<br>- Special feature: The hardest tissue in the body!|
|Cement (Cementum)|- Formation: Initially formed by the embryonic mesenchymal cells of the dental sac and later by fibroblasts and cementoblasts<br>- Function: Covers and protects the dentin at the root<br>- Composition<br>    - 60% minerals and 30% embedded collagen fibers (Sharpey’s fibers) from the periodontal ligament<br>    - 10% water<br>    - Cervical root: acellular<br>    - Apical root: cementocytes|
|Dental pulp|   |
|Pulpagewebe|- Formation: Mesenchymal cells<br>- Function: Nutrition of the tooth and defense against pathogens<br>- Composition<br>    - Mesenchymal tissue with gelatinous ground substance and reticular fibers<br>    - Cells: Odontoblasts, fibroblasts, immune cells<br>    - Many blood and lymph vessels as well as nerve fibers (Raschkow plexus)|
|Dental retainer (periodontium)|   |
|Cement|- see above.|
|Alveolar bone|- Is sometimes porous (cribriform plate)|
|Root sheath (Desmodontium)|- Spans the area between the tooth root and alveolar bone<br>- Interlaced with Sharpey fibers|
|Gum (Gingiva)|- Covers the alveolar ridge and the tooth neck<br>- Fixed, multilayered keratinized epithelium|

> [!NOTE]
> The odontoblasts and ameloblasts are initially positioned directly opposite each other; however, as dentin and enamel continue to form, the cells move away from each other in opposite directions!

## Function

The teeth are responsible for the mechanical breakdown of food during the chewing process.

- Kauakt
    1. "Biting": Separation of food by the cutting action of the incisors.
    2. "Chewing": Abduction and adduction movements of the lower jaw (articulation)
        - The greatest chewing pressure is reached at the 2nd premolars and 1st molars.

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the mechanical breakdown of food, the act of chewing also involves mixing the food with saliva and an initial enzymatic decomposition by the enzymes contained in it!

## Development

The formation of the tooth involves only the ectoderm. The development of the primary teeth and the permanent teeth occurs in exactly the same way and already takes place before birth.

### Origin

- Enamel from ectoderm
- Dental pulp, dentin, periodontal apparatus from ectomesenchyme of the neural crest (also from ectoderm)

### Course of Tooth Development

#### 2. Embryonalmonat

- Ectoderm
    - From the epithelium of the future upper and lower jaw, an arch-shaped epithelial strip (the dental lamina) grows.
    - At the gum line of each dental arch, 10 nodular thickenings develop (corresponding to the number of milk teeth): Development of the enamel organs
        - Are initially cap-shaped (so-called melting cap)
        - Enamel organs consist of an inner and an outer enamel epithelium with intervening enamel pulp (the future preameloblasts arise from the inner enamel epithelium).
        - In the course of development, the enamel organ takes on a bell shape (the so-called enamel bell) and is encased by the dental sac.
- Neural crest: Determined dental mesenchyme
    - Formation of dense mesenchymal connective tissue in the enamel organ: dental papilla (later dental pulp) as well as preodontoblasts
    - Enamel organ is surrounded by cellular connective tissue: dental sac

#### From 4. Embryonal month (Formation of hard substances)

- Thickening of the basement membrane between preodontoblasts and preameloblasts → Differentiation of odontoblasts → Formation of predentin → Differentiation of ameloblasts
- Disintegration of the basement membrane between ameloblasts and odontoblasts
- Through mineralization, hard dentin is formed from predentin.
- Formation of dental enamel by the ameloblasts → Dental enamel and dentin are now in direct contact with each other (enamel-dentin junction)
- As the hard substance formation progresses cervically, the enamel cap continues to grow until the shape of the tooth crown is completed, forming the cervical loop there.
- From the cervical loop, an epithelial root sheath (Hertwig's epithelial sheath) grows beyond the tooth neck and forms a mold for the tooth root.
- After cervical, the epithelial sheath becomes fragmented and dissolves → Mesenchymal cells of the dental follicle come into contact with the root dentin → Formation of cementum and periodontal ligament (tooth supporting apparatus)
- The gum line is slowly receding.
- The remaining parts of the tooth bar are used to create the fixtures for the replacement teeth.

> [!NOTE]
> The development of milk teeth takes about 2–4 years until complete tooth formation (including tooth roots), and the development of replacement teeth can take up to 12 years!

## Review Questions for the Chapter on Teeth
### Macroscopic Anatomy

How many teeth does the milk or permanent dentition consist of?
- The milk dentition consists of 20 and the permanent dentition of 32 teeth.

Which tooth usually erupts first in the primary dentition and which in the permanent dentition?
- The lower incisor is usually the first milk tooth in children. The first tooth of the permanent dentition is the first molar.

Where do nerves and blood vessels enter the root canal?
- Nerves and vessels enter the pulp chamber through the foramen apicis dentis at the tip of the tooth root.

Which nerves supply the teeth with sensation?
- The teeth of the upper jaw are supplied sensitively by the superior alveolar nerves, the teeth of the lower jaw by the inferior alveolar nerves.

### Microscopic Anatomy

Which cells form the "hardest tissue" of the body? Why is this tissue not able to regenerate?
- Tooth enamel is the hardest tissue of the body. It is formed by ameloblasts, which continuously move away from the pulp during the synthesis of the protective tissue. They die off during tooth eruption, which is why enamel is not repairable.

Which cells form dentin and why is dentin capable of regeneration?
- Dentin is formed at the boundary to the pulp by odontoblasts, which remain in an active stage throughout life and thus retain the ability to synthesize dentin anew.

What function does cement have for the tooth?
- Cement covers and protects the dentin as the outermost layer in the root area.
