# Limbic System and Memory
## Summary

The limbic system is a functional system of the CNS that is involved in various tasks: it influences emotions, serves as the center for memory formation, and regulates vegetative functions.

The limbic system consists of structures that are assigned to different sections of the brain. The central hub of the limbic system is the hippocampus, which is located in the caudal temporal lobe and can be recognized by its characteristic paw-like shape. Together with the mammillary bodies, the anterior nucleus of the thalamus, and the parahippocampal gyrus, it forms the so-called Papez circuit - a theoretical construct that is meant to illustrate the memory loop.

There are different forms of memory: the sensory memory, the short-term memory, and the long-term memory. An example of how learning can occur at the cellular level illustrates the concept of so-called long-term potentiation. It is a cellular mechanism in which the synaptic excitability can be lasting altered through a learning process (= using the synapse).
## Overview of the Limbic System

The limbic system consists of structures that are functionally related, but are anatomically assigned to different areas of the brain. The limbic system is primarily responsible for learning processes, memory formation, emotions, and autonomic regulations.

## Hippocampus

### Profile

- Function: Center for Learning and Memory Processes
- Location: In the caudal temporal lobe
- Shape: Paw-shaped

### Anatomy

The hippocampus is the central hub of the limbic system. As part of the cortex, it is located on the medial side of the caudal temporal lobe. It belongs to the archicortex, which, in contrast to the neocortex, consists of only 3–4 layers. Additionally, the hippocampus is clearly distinguished from the other cortical areas by its unique morphology - the coiled cortical structure. It can be recognized from the outside by its characteristic paw-like shape (= pes hippocampi), which extends posteriorly and then curves into the fornix cerebri.

- Morphology and Location
    - Takes up the largest portion of the archicortex
    - Consists (in contrast to the neocortex) of only 3-4 layers that are "rolled up"
    - It is located on the medial side of the lower temporal lobe
    - Forms the medial wall of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle
- Structures visible from the outside
    - Pes hippocampi (= foot of the hippocampus): With finger-like indentations (= Digitationes hippocampi)
    - Taenia fornicis: Strands that transition in a swing-like manner into the Fornix cerebri

#### Shares (visible in cross-section)

One can best imagine the hippocampus as a region of the archicortex that is highly coiled. In its uncoiled state, the most distally located cortical parts (that is, the tail end) are attributed to the dentate gyrus. Proximal to that are the horn of Ammon (hippocampus in the narrower sense) and the subiculum. The combination of the dentate gyrus, horn of Ammon, and subiculum is sometimes referred to as the hippocampal formation.

##### Dentate gyrus

- Function: Primarily receives information via the Tractus perforans from the Area entorhinalis of the Gyrus parahippocampalis and transmits information to the Ammon's horn
- Construction
    - Most tightly rolled portion
    - Three-layered (from outside to inside):
        - Molecular stratum
        - Stratum granulosum: Contains densely packed granule cells
        - Plexiform layer

> [!NOTE]
> The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is one of the few places in the CNS where neuronal stem cells can be found even in adults, making the regeneration of neurons possible!

##### Ammon's horn (= Cornu ammonis)

- Function: Essential to the process of memory formation
- Construction
    - Divided into four areas: CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 (end plate of the hippocampus)
    - Four layers (from outside to inside):
        - Molecular stratum
        - Radiate layer
        - Pyramidal layer
        - Stratum oriens

##### Subiculum

- Function: Obtains information from the Ammon's horn and transmits it through the fornix from the hippocampus to downstream structures (e.g., to the mammillary bodies)
- Structure: Three-layered (from outside to inside):
    - Stratum oriens
    - Pyramidal layer
    - Molecular stratum
- Location: Narrow area of the parahippocampal gyrus, which directly borders the hippocampus

> [!NOTE]
> Gyrus dentatus, Ammon's horn and Subiculum are also referred to as Hippocampal formation!

#### Connections of the Hippocampus

The tractus perforans contains the most important afferent fibers of the hippocampus. It originates in the regio entorhinalis of the gyrus parahippocampalis and ends in the gyrus dentatus of the hippocampus. Within the hippocampus, the information first reaches the gyrus dentatus and then the cornu ammonis. From the subiculum, the information is relayed to subsequent structures via the fornix cerebri.

- Simplified information flow within the hippocampus: dentate gyrus → cornu Ammonis → subiculum
- Afferents of the Hippocampus
    - From the entorhinal region (= entorhinal cortex) via the perforant pathway
    - From the septal nuclei "reciprocally" to the fornix cerebri to the hippocampus
- Efferents of the Hippocampus: Projecting via the Fornix cerebri to the Corpora mamillaria

> [!NOTE]
> The efferent fibers of the hippocampus originate in the subiculum and project through the fornix to the downstream structures. The fornix thus forms the "output" of the hippocampus - however, a few afferent fibers (originating in the septal nuclei) also project to the hippocampus!

## Parahippocampal Gyrus

The parahippocampal gyrus is located in the area of the mediobasal temporal lobe. It contains the entorhinal region, which borders the hippocampus and collects and integrates its afferents before they are relayed to it.

- Location: Borders basally on the hippocampus
- Structure: Contains the entorhinal region
- Function: Entorhinal region forms one of the "input systems" of the hippocampus: The axons of the cells from this region form the perforant pathway
## Cingulate Gyrus

The cingulate gyrus arches over the corpus callosum and extends rostrally into the subcallosal area. With its long association pathway - the cingulum - it forms an important part of the Papez circuit.

- Location: Above the beam, extending rostrally into the subcallosal area.
- Construction
    - Mesocortex
    - In the Marklager is the Cingulum
- Functions (in conjunction with the hippocampus)
    - Part of the Papez circuit
    - Spatial Memory
    - Control of perception and psychomotor drive
## Amygdaloid body

The corpus amygdaloideum is discussed in the chapter cerebrum.
## Papez Circuit

The Papez circuit is a theoretical construct intended to illustrate the memory loop in the limbic system. Its key components include the hippocampus, the mamillary bodies, and the cingulum.

## Learning and Memory

### Definitions

Depending on memory performance (content, duration, capacity), different memory stores can be distinguished. Additionally, there are certain transfer processes that transfer content between the stores.

- Memory storage
    - Sensory memory (= sensory register)
        - Content: Storage for images, sounds, etc.
        - Duration: If the impressions do not capture attention within a few seconds, they are lost again.
    - Short-term memory
        - Content: Conscious processing of the contents of the sensory memory
        - Duration: The content is lost again within about 20 seconds, unless it is repeated.
        - Capacity: About seven information units
    - Long-term memory
        - Content: Contents of the short-term memory are transferred to the long-term memory through repetitions and the creation of associations.
        - Duration: Unlimited
        - Capacity: Unlimited
    - Working memory
        - Content: Information that is stored, linked, and processed at a moment.
        - Duration: About 20 seconds or until the content is no longer being edited
        - Capacity: Limited
- Transfer operations: Transferring content between the storage areas
    - Selection: This process determines which sensory perceptions are transferred from the sensory memory to the short-term memory
    - Memory consolidation: Process of transferring information from short-term to long-term memory

### Forms of Memory

Within the long-term memory, one distinguishes several forms of memory depending on the type of memory content (facts, actions):

- Explicit memory (= declarative memory)
    - Content: Conscious Memory
        - Episodic memory: Personal experiences
        - Semantic memory: factual knowledge
    - Perception: Conscious
    - Storage Locations: Hippocampus (Cache), medial Temporal Lobe
- Implicit memory (= Procedural memory or also non-declarative memory)
    - Content: Unconscious Memory (Actions, movement sequences, cognitive abilities)
        - Habit memory: skills and habits (from English habit = "habit")
        - Priming Memory (Priming Effect)
            - Definition: A process involved in the training of the implicit memory, in which the prior presentation of a stimulus influences and facilitates the response to a subsequent stimulus.
            - Example: A participant reads the word "fruit" in a text, among other things. Subsequently, he is shown a picture of an apple and a picture of a table. Influenced by the unconsciously perceived priming stimulus "fruit," he names the picture of the apple first.
    - Perception: Unconscious
    - Storage locations: Basal ganglia, sensory-motor systems (including cerebellum), amygdala

> [!NOTE]
> The declarative memory arises consciously and relies on the hippocampus. The non-declarative memory, on the other hand, occurs without the involvement of consciousness and takes place in subcortical areas!

### Memory Disorders

- Amnesia: Temporal or content-related impairment of memory (form of memory disorder) following an (often traumatic) event.
    - Retrograde: Amnesia for the time before the event
    - Anterograde: Amnesia for the time after the event
- Dementia: Impairment of several higher cortical functions including memory and orientation increases with age (more than 30% of those over 90 years old are affected)
- Zeigarnik effect: Unfinished tasks and problems are particularly well remembered.
- Interference: One learning process is disrupted by another learning process.
    - Retroactive inhibition: The retrieval of previously learned information is disrupted by a current learning process.
    - Proactive inhibition: A future learning process is disrupted by a current learning process

> [!NOTE] Korsakow Syndrome
> The Korsakoff syndrome is a form of amnesia that can occur in the context of alcohol abuse. In addition to pronounced orientation disorders and disturbances of frontal lobe function, there is an antero- and retrograde amnesia. The existing memory gaps are unconsciously filled by the affected individuals with invented, objectively false content. The affected individuals believe these contents to be true, even when the same gap is filled with different content each time. This phenomenon is referred to as confabulation.

## Learning at the Cellular Level

Neuron plasticity ("malleability") refers to the changes in neural structures depending on the activity of these structures. The volume increase of certain brain areas through intense practice, for example, is one of the mechanisms of neuron plasticity. The concept of so-called long-term potentiation describes this learning mechanism at the cellular level. It occurs in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and can lead to an enhanced synaptic transmission lasting for days. This process involves special glutamate receptors known as NMDA and AMPA receptors.

### Long-term potentiation (LTP)

- Definition: Cellular mechanism in which synaptic excitability is persistently enhanced through a learning process (= use of the synapse)
- Location: Synapses of the pyramidal cells in the hippocampus
- Involved receptors
    - NMDA receptor
        - Localization: Postsynaptic membrane
        - Mode of action: Cation channel (especially permeable to Ca2+) with a glutamate binding site: It is blocked by Mg2+ during resting potential; this blockade initially prevents the influx of Ca2+, only a stronger, especially simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic depolarization "unblocks" the channel and thus allows the influx of Ca2+ into the cell
    - AMPA receptor
        - Localization: Postsynaptic Membrane
        - Mechanism of action: Nonspecific cation channel (permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca2+) with a glutamate binding site: When glutamate binds to the binding site, sodium influx occurs, leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane (EPSP)
- Course of long-term potentiation
    - Short pulse series
        - Action potentials in the afferent nerves lead to the release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft.
        - Glutamate opens AMPA receptors; NMDA receptors are still blocked
    - Longer-lasting pulse series
        - A longer pulse series leads to the opening of numerous AMPA receptors → Postsynapse becomes more strongly depolarized
        - This "unblocks" the NMDA receptor
        - NMDA receptor opens and Ca2+ can flow intracellularly
            - Early long-term potentiation: Lasts for 1-2 hours
                - The intracellular Ca2+ activates various enzymatic systems.
                - These enzyme systems increase, among other things, the postsynaptic sensitivity to glutamate (among other things through the phosphorylation of AMPA receptors) as well as the presynaptic release of transmitters (activation of neuronal NO-synthase → postsynaptic NO-production → NO diffuses into the presynapse → transmitter release↑)
            - Late Long-term potentiation: Lasts for hours to weeks
                - High levels of intracellular Ca2+ influence protein biosynthesis (which also occurs at the level of gene transcription)
                - This alters, among other things, the morphology of the synapses

> [!NOTE]
> The long-term potentiation occurs in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. In this process, the NMDA receptor is important: During the resting potential or only short series of stimuli, it is blocked by Mg2+, and only through a longer series of stimuli does the NMDA receptor become unblocked, allowing Ca2+ to flow intracellularly!

## Review Questions on the Chapter Limbic System
### Overview of the limbic system

What is the main function of the hippocampus? Where is it located and how can it be recognized in a histological preparation?
- The hippocampus is the central relay station of the limbic system and important for learning and memory processes. It ensures that information is transferred from short-term memory to long-term memory. The hippocampus is located in the cortex of the caudal temporal lobe and can be easily identified histologically by its typical "rolled-up" shape of its 3-4 layers.
Where is the Ncl. accumbens located and what is its function?
- The Ncl. accumbens is located in the ventral striatum (cerebrum) and is closely connected with the limbic and psychomotor systems. It receives afferents from dopaminergic fibers of the ventral tegmental area, which play an important role in the reward system as well as in addiction and other psychiatric disorders.
Which part of the hypothalamus is also part of the Papez circuit? What functions does it have?
- The corpora mamillaria are located in the hypothalamus and, as part of the Papez circuit, are involved in learning and memory processes. Additionally, they influence sexual behavior.
Where in the CNS are neural stem cells still located in adults?
- In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, neural stem cells are still found in adults, allowing for the generation of new neurons.
What is the hippocampal formation made of?
- The hippocampal formation consists of the dentate gyrus, Ammon's horn, and subiculum.
Which association pathway runs above the bar?
- The cingulum runs in the cingulate gyrus and is part of the limbic system. It runs rostrally into the subcallosal area.
### Papez-Neuron Circuit

The Papez circuit is composed of which structures?
- The Papez neuronal circuit is a neural circuit formed by important structures of the limbic system. It begins and ends in the hippocampus. Its pathway is as follows: hippocampus → fornix cerebri → corpora mamillaria → mammillothalamic tract → thalamus (anterior thalamic nuclei) → cingulate gyrus → cingulum → parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal region) → perforant path → hippocampus.
### Learning and Memory

What is stored in the sensory memory?
- The sensory memory initially stores sensory impressions such as images or sounds for a short, unconscious moment. If the sensory impressions do not reach attention within a few seconds, they are lost.
What is the working memory?
- The working memory enables one to simultaneously retain, process, and keep accessible several currently relevant contents, as is necessary during learning. Its capacity is limited in both the amount of information and the duration.
How do explicit and implicit memory differ, and where are the corresponding memory contents stored?
- In explicit (= declarative) memory, we store personal experiences (episodic memory) and facts (semantic memory). The processed information is perceived consciously. They are mainly stored in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. Implicit memory is also called non-declarative. Here, we store information that we do not perceive consciously. This includes actions and motor sequences as well as cognitive skills, i.e., procedural and emotional memory contents. These information are stored, among others, in the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.
What is meant by the priming effect?
- The priming effect is a mechanism of implicit memory. A presented stimulus influences and facilitates the response to a subsequent stimulus by activating already existing memory contents. The first stimulus thus "paves the way" for the reaction to the following one.
Explain the terms retrograde and anterograde amnesia!
- Retrograde amnesia is associated with memory loss for information prior to a certain event. Anterograde amnesia refers to the loss of memory after a certain event.
What is meant by interference in psychology? What significance do retroactive and proactive have in this context?
- Interference occurs when one learning process is disturbed by another. This can be retroactive, meaning the retrieval of already learned information is disturbed by the current process, or proactive, meaning a future learning process is disturbed by a current learning process.
### Learning at the Cellular Level

What is meant by neural plasticity?
- Neural plasticity means that neuronal structures can form and change depending on their use. This can result, for example, in the enlargement of a brain area through learning and practice even in adulthood.
How is the NMDA receptor involved in long-term potentiation?
- NMDA receptors are located on the postsynaptic membrane and are blocked for Ca2+ at the resting potential. During sustained and stronger depolarization, they become permeable to Ca2+, which then flows into the cell. The increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration activates various enzyme systems that increase sensitivity to glutamate (via phosphorylation of AMPA receptors). With prolonged elevated Ca2+ concentration, there is altered protein biosynthesis and morphology of the synapse.
