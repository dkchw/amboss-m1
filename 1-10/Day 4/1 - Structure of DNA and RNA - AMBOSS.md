# Structure of DNA and RNA
## Summary

The genetic information of an organism is stored in the form of nucleic acids. These nucleic acids – DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) – are long linear polymers. This means they are made up of nucleotide building blocks, which consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and one of four bases. DNA molecules are significantly longer than RNA molecules and contain the entire genetic information of an organism, which is encoded in the sequence of the bases. RNA molecules, on the other hand, contain only a portion of the information and can take on very different tasks within the cell.

The decisive structural feature of DNA is its double helix: Two antiparallel, complementary strands of nucleic acids twist around each other in a spiral shape. On the outside is the so-called DNA backbone with alternating linked sugar and phosphate residues. Inside the helix are the bases. They form base pairs, with adenine and thymine, as well as guanine and cytosine, linked by hydrogen bonds.

The human genome comprises 3.2×10^9 base pairs. However, these are not found on a long, continuous strand of DNA, but are divided among 23 chromosomes. Each chromosome is a linear DNA molecule of a specific length. It is only clearly visible under a light microscope during the metaphase of mitosis, as it is most densely packed at that time. In most body cells, the chromosomes are present in pairs. One part of the pair comes from the mother and the other part from the father. The two corresponding chromosomes are referred to as homologous, as each possesses a variant of the same gene. Changes in the number or structure of chromosomes lead to various disease manifestations, such as developmental disorders. The examination of chromosomes using various molecular biological and cytogenetic methods often enables a definitive diagnosis.

## Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids

DNA and RNA are nucleic acids, meaning they are long-chain, directional macromolecules made up of nucleotide building blocks. "Directional" means that the nucleotide subunits are always linked together in a specific direction, which results in a reading direction. However, nucleotides and their derivatives also fulfill additional roles beyond their function as building blocks of nucleic acids.

## Molecular Properties of Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids

The chemical structure of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and their composition from repeating nucleotide units enable their function as carriers and transmitters of information.

### General Structure of Nucleotides

- Construction
    - Base (a purine or a pyrimidine derivative)
    - Sugar (Pentose)
    - Phosphate residue(s)
- Attachments
    - Base + sugar → (N-glycosidic bond) → nucleoside
    - Nucleoside + phosphate residue at the 3' or 5' C-atom of the sugar → (ester bond) → nucleotide (also called nucleoside monophosphate, e.g., AMP)
- Nucleotides as building blocks in nucleic acids
    - Nucleic acids = long chains (polymers) of nucleotides
    - Primary structure of nucleic acid: Nucleotide sequence in the chain
    - Sugar residues + phosphate residues of the individual nucleotides form the backbone of DNA and RNA.
    - Sugar residues are linked by phosphodiester bridges.
    - Phosphodiester bonds are negatively charged.

> [!note]
> One end of the nucleotide chain has a free 3'OH group, while the other end has a free 5'OH group, which is usually linked to a phosphate group. By convention, the sequence of bases in a nucleic acid is always written in the 5'→3' direction!

> [!note]
> Nucleotide: Base + Sugar; Nucleotide: Base + Sugar + Phosphate!

### Nucleic Acid Bases

Nucleic acid bases are heterocyclic derivatives of purines and pyrimidines that occur in DNA and RNA. Their sequence in the nucleic acid chain is crucial for encoding genetic information.

#### Structure and Nomenclature of Nucleic Acid Bases

|Framework|Base in DNA and/or RNA|As a nucleoside unit in RNA|As a nucleoside unit in DNA|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pyrimidine|Cytosine (C)|Cytidine|Deoxycytidine|
|Thymine (T)|∅|Thymidine|
|Uracil (U)|Uridine|∅|
|Purin|Adenine (A)|Adenosine|Deoxyadenosine|
|Guanine (G)|Guanosine|Deoxyguanosine|

> [!note]
> The bases of DNA are guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine, while those of RNA are guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil!

#### Keto-Enol Tautomerism of Nucleic Acid Bases

- Intramolecular rearrangements (isomerizations) in purines and pyrimidines that have a keto group (i.e., a non-terminal carbonyl group) and an adjacent hydrogen atom.
- The reaction equilibrium for purine and pyrimidine bases lies on the side of the keto form.
- This is important for DNA replication and the transcription process, as no correct base pairing can occur in the enol form (which could potentially result in mutations).

#### Other important bases

Further important bases are the purine bases hypoxanthine and xanthine. Both are intermediate products of purine metabolism and are not part of DNA. Hypoxanthine occurs as a rare base in RNA, for example, in the context of RNA editing. The nucleoside of hypoxanthine is called inosine, and the nucleoside of xanthine is called xanthosine.

### Nucleic Acid Sugar

The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, while the sugar in RNA is ribose.

- Structure: DNA and RNA contain a pentose as sugar, which is present in a five-membered ring.
    - Nomenclature: The numbering of the carbon atoms of the sugars in nucleic acids is done using a number with a dash. This allows them to be distinguished from the numbers for the atoms of the bases, which are written without a dash.
    - Difference: Deoxyribose differs from ribose by the absence of an oxygen atom at the C2' carbon.
- Binding
    - Between pentose and base: N-glycosidic bond
        - Connects the C1' atom of ribose or deoxyribose with the N9 atom of purine bases or the N1 atom of pyrimidine bases.
    - Between the pentoses: phosphodiester bond

> [!note]
> Dideoxyribonucleotides, which also lack the oxygen atom at the C3' position, are called dideoxyribonucleotides. Their incorporation leads to the termination of DNA replication and transcription, which is utilized, for example, in Sanger DNA sequencing and in the antiviral therapy of HIV infections.

### Phosphate Residues

- A nucleotide can have one, two, or three phosphate groups.
- Binding
    - Between ribose and phosphate group: Phosphate ester bond
    - Between the phosphate residues: High-energy phosphoric anhydride bonds
- Depending on the number of phosphate residues, the nucleotides are also referred to as
    - Nucleoside monophosphate (Base + Sugar + Phosphate group)
    - Nucleoside diphosphate (Base+Sugar+Phosphate residue+Phosphate residue)
    - Nucleotide triphosphate (Base + Sugar + Phosphate group + Phosphate group + Phosphate group)
- Depending on whether the phosphate group is attached to the C3' atom or the C5' atom of the sugar, the naming of the nucleotides also occurs.
    - Example: Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (abbreviated 5'-ATP) for an adenosine nucleoside with three phosphate groups linked to the C5' atom.
- A "d" denotes a deoxyribonucleotide.
    - Example: Deoxyadenosine-5'-monophosphate (abbreviated 5'-dAMP) for a deoxyadenosine nucleoside with a phosphate group linked through the C5' atom.

## Function of Nucleotides and Their Derivatives

Nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives have important functions in the body.
- Building blocks of nucleic acids: The nucleoside triphosphates dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (in DNA) or ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP (in RNA) are the activated precursors for the synthesis of DNA and RNA.
- Energy carriers: In particular, as the universal energy currency of the cell in the form of ATP, but also GTP
- Signaling molecules: Above all, the second messengers cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate), both phosphoric acid diesters.
- Activators for the transfer of groups: Nucleotides are capable of transferring a molecule to another in biosyntheses due to their ability to form high-energy bonds, e.g.:
    - UDP-Glucose is an activated form of glucose in glycogen biosynthesis.
    - Choline derived from food can be activated to CDP-choline via CTP and thus used in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine.
    - 3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) serves as a sulfate group donor in the biosynthesis of sulfolipids.
    - S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) is formed from methionine and serves as a cofactor in methylation reactions.
- Regulators: Of enzymatic reactions in signal transduction pathways (e.g., activated GTP G-proteins)
- Carrier molecules: E.g. the electron carriers Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as components of coenzymes in redox reactions.

> [!note]
> The energy carrier ATP contains ribose and not deoxyribose as sugar, so it has a 2'OH group!

## DNA: Structure and Properties

The DNA contains the genetic information of the cell and passes it on to the daughter cells during cell division. The structure of the DNA molecules as double strands and the specific base pairing enable the production of two identical daughter molecules.

### DNA Structure

The DNA is not present in the cell most of the time as a single-stranded chain of deoxyribonucleotides, but rather as a double strand. The two strands are complementary to each other and run antiparallel. The bases in the two strands form specific base pairs through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds).

- Double helix: Three-dimensional structure of DNA in which the two polynucleotide strands twist around each other in a spiral manner.
- Stabilization through
    - Base pairing through hydrogen bonds
    - Hydrophobic Effect: The negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone is located on the outside, with the bases inside the helix.
    - "Base stack": The base pairs stack on top of each other ("stacking interactions") and are attracted to each other by Van der Waals forces, which provides further stabilization.
- Additional features: On the outer side of the double helix, there are two grooves, the minor groove and the major groove.

> [!note]
> Base pairs in DNA: Guanine pairs with Cytosine (3 H-bonds), Adenine pairs with Thymine (2 H-bonds)!

### DNA Conformation

DNA can take on various structural forms. In vivo, it primarily exists in the B conformation (B-DNA). In addition to B-DNA, there is also an A conformation (A-DNA) and a Z conformation (Z-DNA). Moreover, higher-order (tertiary) structures can form, which arise due to supercoiling. James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins derived a model of B-DNA from various experimental observations. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962 for this; Franklin had passed away earlier and could not be honored.

#### Properties of B-DNA

- Right-handed double helix
- 10 base pairs per helical turn over a length of 3.4nm
- Helix diameter: 2nm
- Bases are approximately vertical to the axis of the helix.

#### Properties of A-DNA

- Like B-DNA, a right-handed double helix, but broader and shorter than B-DNA.
- Base pairs are not perpendicular to the helix axis, but are slightly inclined with respect to the axis.
- Dehydrated form, i.e. DNA can exist experimentally in this way, but not in vivo; however, some RNAs and DNA-RNA hybrids adopt this conformation.

#### Properties of Z-DNA

- Left-handed double helix
- Longer stretched than B-DNA and therefore smaller diameter
- Occurring in GC-rich sequences, but overall rare under physiological conditions.
- Phosphate groups of the DNA backbone form a zigzag line here.

> [!note]
> The DNA is mainly present in the cell as B-DNA and is thus a right-handed double helix!

#### Supercoils

- Definition: Twisted double helix, also known as superhelix
- Occurrence: Particularly in circular DNA molecules
    - In prokaryotes: bacterial chromosome, plasmids
    - In eukaryotes
        - Mitochondrial DNA (circular)
        - "Inflexible" sections of linear, chromosomal DNA
- Properties: Supercoiled DNA molecules, which are in the form of supercoils, have a much more compact structure than relaxed forms of the same molecule.

### Additional Structural Features of DNA

The DNA is very flexible in its length direction. The binding of proteins can influence the conformation of the DNA. But the sequence of the bases also affects its local structure.

#### Palindrome

- Definition: A palindrome is generally a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g. Otto.
- Molecular biological use of the term "palindrome" for so-called inverted repeats (reverse sequence repeats)
    - On the two complementary strands of a DNA double helix, palindromic sequences have the same base sequences over a certain segment, meaning that when read in the 5'→3' direction, the order of the bases is the same.
    - There may be bases in between that do not match.
    - These sections are complementary to themselves and can form hairpin structures.
    - In double-stranded DNA, this leads to the formation of cross-shaped structures.
- Function: Some proteins that can bind DNA require palindromic sequences as recognition sequences, e.g. steroid hormone receptors or restriction enzymes.

## RNA: Structure and Properties

### RNA Classes and Their Structure

RNA molecules are nucleic acids (like DNA molecules). In principle, the structure of an RNA single strand (primary structure) resembles that of DNA single strands. As mentioned above, however, RNA contains ribose as its sugar and uracil as its base. RNA molecules found in cells are significantly shorter than DNA molecules and serve very different functions, including in protein biosynthesis, as structural components, or as an enzyme (ribozyme). RNAs can be classified into different classes, which vary in their length, structure, and function. Depending on the class, RNA molecules can be single-stranded or partially double-stranded. In double-stranded RNA segments, guanine pairs with cytosine (3 hydrogen bonds) and adenine pairs with uracil (2 hydrogen bonds).

### RNA interference (RNAi)

- Definition: Targeted silencing of specific target RNAs (mostly mRNAs) through short, single-stranded RNAs that bind to the target RNAs through base pairing.
- Regulatory RNA molecules: including miRNAs, siRNAs
- Function
    - Downregulation of gene expression (so-called gene silencing)
    - Defense mechanism against foreign RNA molecules
- Mechanisms
    - Inhibition of Translation
    - Destabilization of the mRNA
        - Removal of the polyadenylate tail at the 3' OH end of the mRNA (Deadenylation)
        - Removal of the 5'-cap (engl. decapping)
    - Degradation of mRNA

## Organization of the Human Genome

The human genome consists of about 3.2 billion base pairs. A diploid human cell therefore contains 6.4 x 10^9 bp. If the DNA of a cell were to exist as a linear molecule, all chromosomes together would have a length of about 1.8 meters. Therefore, the DNA must be packaged within the cell nucleus.

### Proportions of the Different Sequences in the Human Genome

The human genome is divided into the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome.

#### Shares of the Core Genome

- About 10% genes and related sequences
    - About 3% of the core genome codes for proteins (including introns) and RNAs
        - About 1% of the core genome encodes for proteins (only exons)
- Approximately 90% no genes
    - About 45% of the core genome consists of repetitive sequences (repetitive DNA elements)
        - Simple repetitive DNA elements ("tandem repeats")
            - Macro-satellite DNA (= satellite DNA): sequence repetitions of up to 18000 nucleotides
            - Minisatellite DNA: Sequence repeats of 3 to 100 nucleotides
            - Microsatellite DNA: Sequence repetitions of 2 to 6 nucleotides
        - Formerly "mobile" DNA elements (such as transposons, LTR, non-LTR, LINE, SINE)
    - About 24% of the core genome consists of introns.

#### Mitochondrial Genome (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA)

- Circular genome of approximately 16,500 bp (base pairs)
- Over 90% of the mtDNA encode for structural genes.
    - 13 genes that code for proteins, thus for mRNAs
    - 22 genes for tRNAs
    - 2 genes for rRNA

### Composition and Structure of Chromosomes

The DNA is present in the cell nucleus of eukaryotes bound to protein complexes. In electron microscope images, these structures look like pearls on a string. They are further condensed into chromatin fibers, which in turn are folded into loops by the action of other proteins. At maximum condensation, the DNA molecules are present in the metaphase of mitosis. Only here are the individual chromosomes distinguishable under a light microscope.

- Chromosome
    - Definition
        - In eukaryotes, linear DNA double strand that carries the hereditary information for the structure and function of the organism.
        - Is part of the genome and contains coding and non-coding sections
- Condensation levels of DNA in the cell nucleus (from least to most condensed)
    - DNA double helix
    - Nucleosome: DNA double helix + histone proteins (histone octamer)
    - 30nm chromatin fiber (also: solenoid)
    - Chromatin loop
    - Chromosomes in metaphase (condensed by a factor of 10,000 compared to the level of the DNA double helix)

#### Histone Proteins

- Definition: Group of proteins that bind DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotes
- General Characteristics
    - Positively charged due to a high proportion of basic amino acids (Arginine and Lysine)
    - Strong ionic interactions are formed with the negatively charged DNA.
    - Are present in such large numbers that their mass corresponds approximately to that of the DNA in the cell nucleus.
    - Are synthesized in the cytosol on free ribosomes and transported to the nucleus.
- Types: There are 4 core histones and one linker histone.
    - Core histone
        - Protein names: H2A, H2B, H3, H4
        - Structure: All four core histones have a similar structure that has hardly changed over the course of evolution.
        - Function
            - They form the nucleosome core around which the DNA is always wound in sections.
                - Structurally, it is a histone octamer, as it is a protein complex composed of eight proteins (two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4).
            - Regulate gene expression through post-translational modification of histones, among other things, through acetylation of lysine.
    - Connection history
        - Proteinname: H1
        - Structure: Not completely known yet, but a different, less uniform structure than core histones.
        - Function: Stabilizes the DNA on the histone octamer and partially binds to the DNA in the linker regions between the nucleosomes.

#### Nucleosome (Nucleosome Core Particle)

- Definition: Structural and functional basic unit of chromatin
- Structure
    - Complex of DNA (approximately 150bp) and histone octamer
        - DNA forms a flat, left-handed superhelix around the nucleosome core with about 1.8 turns.
        - The nucleosomes are connected by short DNA segments of variable length (averaging 50 to 60 bp).
            - These DNA fragments are also called linker DNA.
            - Nucleosomes and linker DNA together form the nucleosome strand
    - 30nm fiber (solenoid)
        - Nucleosome strand, which is spirally wound into fibers with a diameter of 30nm
        - Each turn of the 30nm fibers contains about six nucleosomes.
        - The histone protein H1 is involved in stabilization.
    - Loop
        - Higher-order DNA packaging beyond nucleosomes and 30nm fibers
        - Both the histone protein H1 and so-called non-histone proteins are involved in the formation of loops.

#### Chromatin

- Definition: Complex of DNA and all proteins associated with it (histone proteins and non-histone proteins)
- Function: Compaction and organization of the DNA structure (also influences gene regulation)
- Forms
    - Heterochromatin: Tightly packed, contains "inactive" DNA
        - Constitutive Heterochromatin: Mainly composed of non-coding, repetitive DNA sequences, this heterochromatin is also present in a condensed form within interphase cell nuclei and is particularly found near telomeres and centromeres.
        - Facultative heterochromatin: Coding, i.e., DNA sequences containing genes that can optionally, i.e., facultatively, exist as heterochromatin, but can also be unpacked as euchromatin.
            - Example: One of the two X chromosomes in the cells of a female organism exists as facultative heterochromatin and is inactivated.
    - Euchromatin: Loosely packed, contains "active" DNA, i.e., DNA where transcription can occur.
- Structure: Basic framework made up of repeating units (nucleosomes)

### Morphology and Representation of Chromosomes

The chromosomes are only visible during cell division, particularly in metaphase.

- Chromosome set of humans: 23 pairs of homologous (similar) chromosomes
    - Classification by multiples of the chromosome set
        - Diploid ("double" set of chromosomes): Human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes - that is, 46 DNA molecules - of different lengths, which form 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. One of the homologous chromosomes comes from one parent, the other from the other parent.
        - Haploid ("simple" chromosome set): After meiosis, the germ cells contain only 23 chromosomes (no chromosome pairs!), thus a haploid chromosome set with only one copy of each chromosome.
    - Division into autosomes and sex chromosomes
        - 22 pairs of autosomes, consisting of two homologous chromosomes
        - 1 pair of sex chromosomes, consisting of two X chromosomes (♀) or one X and one Y chromosome (♂)
            - Pseudoautosomal regions (PAR): DNA segments found equally on the X and Y chromosomes, with PAR1 located on the short arm and PAR2 on the long arm of the sex chromosomes.
- Depending on which phase of the cell cycle a cell is in, a chromosome consists of one or two chromatids.
    - Sister chromatids: Two identical DNA molecules with associated packaging proteins, formed by DNA replication and connected via the centromere by so-called cohesins.

> [!note]
> The term "chromosome" is also very often used synonymously for the light-microscopically visible metaphase chromosome, even though chromosomes are present in all phases of the cell cycle.

#### Characteristics of Chromosomes (Chromosome Morphology)

- Kinetochore: Protein complex on the chromosomes that serves as an attachment point for the microtubules during mitosis.
- Centromere: Connection point of the sister chromatids
    - Divides the chromatids into a short p arm and a long q arm
    - Depending on the position of the centromere, chromosomes are divided into
        - Submetacentric: The centromere is not exactly in the middle, meaning that the short p-arm and the long q-arm are clearly visible.
        - Metacentric: Centromere approximately in the middle, meaning p- and q-arms are about equal in length.
        - Acrocentric: The centromere connects almost one of the ends of both sister chromatids.
            - The acrocentric autosomes (chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22) contain the genes for the large ribosomal RNAs at their short ends, which are arranged in the so-called nucleolus organizer regions (NOR).
    - The kinetochores are assembled at the centromere (which is why the centromere is often referred to as the attachment point of the spindle)
- Telomere: Repetitive, non-coding DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes

> [!note]
> Chromosomes are classified according to their length, the position of the centromere, and their banding pattern!

#### Representation of the Chromosomes

To investigate the chromosome number and to obtain an overview of any structural changes, the chromosomes can be made visible in a so-called karyogram. Through various staining methods, specific banding patterns are obtained, which are characteristic for each chromosome.

- Karyogram
    - Presentation method for examining the chromosomes of an individual and revealing possible deviations in their number or structure
    - The chromosomes are isolated and stained; then the so-called banding pattern can be analyzed.
    - Band pattern: Bands running crosswise of different widths and distributions, which can be induced depending on the preparation and dyeing technique.
        - Material
            - For cytogenetic analysis, lymphocyte preparations are usually used.
            - In prenatal diagnostics, amniotic cells are also used.
        - Preparation
            - The cells to be examined are cultured and stimulated to divide.
            - To obtain metaphase chromosomes, the cells are then treated with the spindle poison colchicine.
                - This prevents the sister chromatids from being separated from each other during the anaphase of mitosis.
        - Banding Techniques
            - Staining with Quinacrine (fluorescent bands, although no longer used diagnostically today)
            - Giemsa staining (standard banding technique, produces dark G bands with transcriptionally inactive chromatin and light, transcriptionally active R bands)
        - Analyze: Examination of an average of 10 to 15 metaphase chromosome sets at 1250-fold magnification
        - Result
            - Karyotype: Evaluation of the karyogram based on the number and structure of the chromosomes
                - First, the total number of chromosomes is mentioned, then the type of sex chromosomes present, and finally any anomalies, if applicable.
                    - Examples: (46, XX) for a normal, female karyotype, (47, XY+21) for a boy with Trisomy 21 (see also: Human Genetics - Preclinical)

##### Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH)

- Definition: Method for the specific staining of DNA sequences using fluorescence-labeled DNA probes, e.g., for staining chromosomes in karyograms, for tumor diagnostics, or for mapping genes on chromosomes in metaphase.
- Principle
    - Denaturation of DNA in the prepared chromosomes
    - Hybridization of DNA with single-stranded, fluorescence-labeled DNA probes that are complementary to DNA segments from different chromosomes.
    - Examination of the chromosome set in a fluorescence microscope
        - Where the probe is bound, a color signal can be seen
        - If the signal is missing, one can assume that the complementary section of the DNA is missing.
- Special Features
    - The specific staining increases the resolution compared to classical staining methods for karyotypes.
    - This also allows for the detection of smaller changes in the chromosomes, such as minor deletions.
    - FISH is also possible on chromosomes in interphase.
## Review Questions on the Chapter Structure of DNA and RNA
### Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids

How is a nucleotide structured? What bonds does it contain?
- A nucleotide consists of a purine or pyrimidine base, a 5-carbon sugar (pentose), and a phosphate group. The base and sugar form an N-glycosidic bond (= nucleoside). Between the phosphate group and the 3' or 5' carbon atom of the sugar of the nucleoside, an ester bond is formed. In this way, nucleoside monophosphates (= nucleotides), e.g., AMP, are formed.

What are the bases of DNA and RNA called? Which bases pair with each other?
- Both DNA and RNA contain the bases guanine, cytosine, and adenine. Additionally, DNA contains thymine, and RNA contains uracil. Guanine pairs with cytosine via three hydrogen bonds, and adenine pairs with thymine or uracil via two hydrogen bonds.

What other important bases do you know? What are their nucleosides called?
- The purine bases hypoxanthine and xanthine are intermediates of purine metabolism. They are not incorporated into DNA. The nucleoside of hypoxanthine is inosine, and that of xanthine is xanthosine.

How is the nomenclature of sugars in DNA and RNA defined?
- The sugars (DNA: deoxyribose; RNA: ribose) in nucleic acids exist as five-membered rings. The numbering of the carbon atoms of the sugars is marked with a prime (') to distinguish them from the carbon atoms of the bases, which are written without a prime.

How is the signaling molecule cAMP structured?
- The ribose unit of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) forms an ester bond at both the C3' and C5' atoms with the same phosphate group (phosphodiester) – resulting in ring closure. The C1' atom of the ribose is connected via an N-glycosidic bond to the N9 atom of the base.

What sugar does ATP contain?
- The universal energy carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contains ribose and therefore has a 2'-OH group.

### DNA

How is DNA typically present in the cell?
- DNA usually exists as a double strand and forms a double helix whose strands are complementary and antiparallel. The bases form specific base pairs via hydrogen bonds.

How many base pairs are typically found in B-DNA per helical turn?
- In the right-handed double helix of B-DNA, which primarily occurs in vivo, there are about 10 base pairs per helical turn.

Explain the term palindrome!
- In molecular biology, the term palindrome is used for so-called "inverted repeats." On the two complementary strands of a DNA double strand, the base sequence over a specific sequence segment is the same (always read in the 5'→3' direction!). Palindromes serve as recognition sequences for some proteins to bind DNA.

### RNA

Describe important structural features of tRNA!
- tRNA (transfer RNA) forms a characteristic cloverleaf shape with its base pairs. There are two important structural features: 1. an anticodon loop, which contains the binding site of three bases (anticodon) for recognizing the complementary mRNA (codon); 2. a 3'-OH end with a CCA sequence, to which the amino acid matching the anticodon binds. tRNA also contains many unusual bases such as pseudouridine, which are formed from uracil after tRNA synthesis.

What components make up the subunits of extramitochondrial ribosomes?
- Extramitochondrial ribosomes consist of four rRNA types: 5S-, 5.8S-, and 28S-rRNA in the large subunit, and 18S-rRNA in the small subunit.

What task does rRNA undertake?
- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) functions as a catalyst of the translation phase of protein biosynthesis. The 28S component catalyzes, for example, the formation of a peptide bond and is therefore also called a ribozyme.

Which RNA is a component of the spliceosome?
- snRNA (small nuclear RNA) is involved in splicing pre-mRNA and is thus a component of the spliceosome.

What function do microRNAs have?
- MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to non-coding RNAs. They regulate gene expression by predominantly binding complementary mRNAs, promoting their degradation, and thus preventing their translation.

What is meant by RNA interference and what mechanisms does it utilize?
- RNA interference refers to the targeted silencing of specific target RNAs. This can occur by inhibition of translation, by destabilization of mRNAs through deadenylation or decapping, or by degradation of mRNAs.

What is the primary role of snoRNAs?
- Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are non-coding RNAs in the nucleolus of the cell nucleus and are primarily involved in the modification of RNA molecules.

What role does RNA play within telomerase?
- Telomerase contains RNA that serves as a template, allowing it to extend the non-coding ends of genomic DNA during DNA replication and thus prevent loss of coding DNA segments. Telomerase is therefore a reverse transcriptase that carries its own RNA template.

### Organization of the Human Genome

How much percent of the core genome or the mitochondrial genome is coded for genes? What about the rest?
- Only about 10% of the core genome codes for genes, and of these, just 1% codes for proteins. The remaining 90% do not code for genes; for example, 45% of the core genome consists of repetitive sequences (repetitive DNA elements), and about 24% are introns. The mitochondrial genome, however, contains more than 90% coding sequences.

What simple repetitive DNA elements do you know?
- Among tandem repeats (= simple repetitive DNA elements), macro-, mini-, and microsatellite DNA can be distinguished based on their sequence repetitions: microsatellite DNA has repeats of 2–6 nucleotides, minisatellites 3–100, and macrosatellites up to 18,000.

Why are histone proteins positively charged?
- The basic amino acids arginine and lysine make up a large part of histone proteins. Therefore, they are positively charged, which favors electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA.

What is a nucleosome?
- A nucleosome is a complex of DNA and histone octamers. This packaging of DNA forms the structural and functional basic unit of chromatin.

What is referred to as chromatin?
- Chromatin refers to the complex of DNA and all associated proteins (histone proteins and non-histone proteins).

How do heterochromatin and euchromatin differ?
- Euchromatin is loosely packed DNA that is ready for transcription. Heterochromatin, on the other hand, is densely packed in the nucleus, making transcription impossible. Constitutive heterochromatin mainly consists of non-coding, repetitive DNA sequences. It is distinguished from facultative heterochromatin, which also contains coding DNA sequences and is either densely packed or unpacked (i.e., as euchromatin) as needed.

How many chromosomes (autosomes and gonosomes) does the human chromosome set consist of?
- The human chromosome set consists of 23 homologous chromosome pairs: 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of gonosomes, which consists either of two X chromosomes (♀) or one X and one Y chromosome (♂).

What does the karyotype of a healthy woman or a healthy man look like?
- In the karyogram, all autosomes are shown in double copies and additionally the gonosomes. The karyogram of a healthy woman is therefore 46, XX, and that of a healthy man is 46, XY.

Where are pseudoautosomal regions found?
- Pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) are found on the gonosomes (i.e., both on the X and Y chromosomes). PAR1 is located on the short arm and PAR2 on the long arm of the gonosomes.

What is referred to as a kinetochore? Where is it assembled?
- The protein complex that serves as the attachment point for microtubules on chromosomes during mitosis is called the kinetochore. After binding of the microtubules, the connection between sister chromatids dissolves, and they are pulled to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are assembled at the centromere, which is therefore also called the attachment point of the spindle.

What is the name of the connection point of the sister chromatids?
- The protein complex that serves as the attachment point for microtubules on chromosomes during mitosis is called the kinetochore. After binding of the microtubules, the connection between sister chromatids dissolves, and they are pulled to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are assembled at the centromere, which is therefore also called the attachment point of the spindle.

Where are nucleolus organizer regions typically located? What is encoded there?
- Nucleolus organizer regions (NOR) are typically located on the very short arms of the acrocentric autosomes (chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, 22). These ends contain the genes for the large ribosomal RNAs (5.8S-, 18S-, and 28S-rRNA).
