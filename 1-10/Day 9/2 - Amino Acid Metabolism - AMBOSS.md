# Amino Acid Metabolism
## Summary

The amino acid metabolism includes all processes carried out in the body for the purpose of building up and breaking down amino acids. Amino acids are produced in the body during proteolysis – that is, during the breakdown of dietary proteins or body proteins. The breakdown pathways of individual amino acids are often multi-step and complex. However, what they all have in common is that the amino group is first removed, and the resulting carbon skeleton is further utilized in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as in the citric acid cycle. Many different enzymes are involved in these processes. Inborn defects of these enzymes can lead to serious diseases, such as phenylketonuria or homocystinuria.

A central role in amino acid metabolism is played by the urea cycle – because the amino groups are often released in the form of the cytotoxic ammonia. This is converted into urea in the urea cycle, which can be excreted with the urine.

In the body, only non-essential amino acids can be synthesized. Often, the process of synthesis corresponds to the reverse breakdown. The synthesis steps of essential amino acids are too complex, and the enzymes required for them have likely been lost over the course of evolution.
## Amino Acid Degradation

The amino acids released during proteolysis are either further broken down for energy production, used for the resynthesis of proteins, or converted into other important metabolic products. The breakdown of essential amino acids primarily occurs in the liver, while that of non-essential amino acids takes place throughout the body.

- Principle of Deconstruction
    1. Separation of the amino group (transamination and deamination) or the carboxyl group (decarboxylation)
    2. Further utilization of the resulting framework in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism as well as in the citric acid cycle.
- Important enzymes: A variety of enzymes are involved, such as transaminases, dehydrogenases, dehydrases (see below).
- Important coenzyme: PALP (Pyridoxal phosphate)

### Transamination

- Definition: Transfer of an amino group from an amino acid to an α-keto acid.
- Goal: Degradation of amino acids and synthesis of non-essential amino acids from α-keto acids
- Enzyme
    - Aminotransferases (= Transaminases): E.g. ALT (for Alanine Aminotransferase; also GPT for Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase) and AST (for Aspartate Aminotransferase; also GOT for Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase)
    - Prosthetic Group: PALP
        - The amino acids are covalently bound to PALP in an intermediate step.
- Example reactions
    - ALT: Alanine + α-Ketoglutarate ⇄ Pyruvate + Glutamate
    - AST: Aspartate + α-Ketoglutarate ⇄ Oxaloacetate + Glutamate

> [!NOTE]
> Glutamate is the focal point of amino acid metabolism through transamination reactions!

> [!NOTE] Laboratory diagnostics of aminotransferases
> The aminotransferases play a guiding role in clinical practice: they are released in the event of liver cell damage and can then be found in increased numbers in the blood. Based on their serum concentrations as well as their ratio to each other, the extent of liver cell damage can be estimated, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the genesis: ALT is mainly found in the cytosol of liver cells, while AST is primarily located in the mitochondria. The more severe the liver cell damage, the more of the mitochondrial enzymes are released. In clinical practice, the so-called De Ritis quotient is used here, which represents the ratio of AST/ALT: a low De Ritis quotient of <1 indicates less liver damage (e.g., in mild fatty liver), while a high quotient of >1 indicates severe damage (e.g., in fulminant hepatitis). Unlike ALT, AST is also present in heart muscle cells. If its concentration increases in the serum while that of ALT remains normal, this may also indicate damage to heart muscle cells, such as in the case of a heart attack.

### Deamination

Desamination refers to a reaction in which the amino group of an amino acid is not transferred to another carbon compound, but is released in the form of ammonia.

#### Oxidative Deamination

- Definition: Cleavage of the amino group after prior oxidation of the amino acid
- Goal: Breakdown of glutamate and provision of ammonia for urea synthesis
- Counter-reaction (reductive amination): Uptake of ammonia through the formation of glutamate
- Enzyme: Glutamate dehydrogenase (Cofactor NAD+ or NADP+)
- Reaction
    1. Oxidation of glutamate to an imino acid (intermediate)
    2. Hydrolytic cleavage to α-keto acid and ammonia
- Example: Glutamate + NAD(P)+ + H2O ⇄ α-Ketoglutarate + NH4+ + NAD(P)H + H+

> [!NOTE]
> The glutamate dehydrogenase can use both NAD+ and NADP+ as cofactors!

#### Eliminating Deamination

- Definition: Separation of the amino group in the form of ammonia with the elimination of water.
- Goal: Breakdown of the alcoholic/sulfur-containing amino acids serine, threonine, and cysteine
- Enzyme: Various, e.g. serindehydratase
- Reactions
    1. Elimination of the hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group (as H2O or H2S) resulting in the formation of a double bond.
    2. Hydrolytic removal of the amino group (as ammonia)
- Cofactor: PALP

#### Hydrolytic Deamination

- Definition: Cleavage of the amino group in the form of ammonia with the incorporation of water.
- Goal: Degradation of the amides glutamine and asparagine and provision of ammonia for urea synthesis.
- Enzyme: Glutaminase and Asparaginase
- Reactions
    - Glutaminase: Glutamine + H2O → Glutamate + Ammonia
    - Asparaginase: Asparagine + H2O → Aspartate + Ammonia

> [!NOTE]
> Ammonia is primarily produced in the context of two metabolic processes: the oxidative deamination of glutamate and the hydrolytic deamination of glutamine!

> [!NOTE]
> The hydrolytic deamination is irreversible!

### Decarboxylation

- Definition: Decarboxylation of the α-carboxyl group of an amino acid with the release of CO2
- Meaning: Synthesis of biogenic amines
- Enzyme: L-Amino Acid Decarboxylases
- Cofactor: PALP

## Further Utilization of the Carbon Skeleton of Amino Acids

Depending on the breakdown pathway of their carbon framework, amino acids can be classified into three different types.

1. Glucogenic amino acids: Breakdown to pyruvate and to metabolites of the citric acid cycle, then:
    - Oxidation to CO2 in the citric acid cycle for energy production or
    - Use as a substrate for gluconeogenesis
2. Ketogenic Amino Acids: Breakdown to Acetyl-CoA, then:
    - Oxidation of the acetyl group to CO2 in the citric acid cycle for energy production or
    - Synthesis of ketone bodies or
    - Synthesis of fatty acids or cholesterol
3. Mixed glucogenic/ketogenic amino acids: Breakdown into Acetyl-CoA and glucogenic breakdown products

|Lysine<br><br>Leucine|- Ketogenic: Breakdown to Acetyl-CoA|

> [!NOTE]
> Lysine and leucine are the only purely ketogenic amino acids!

### Degradation of glucogenic amino acids

- Glycine, Alanine, Serine, and Cysteine: Are broken down to pyruvate.
    - Alanine: Transamination by alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
    - Serine, Cysteine, Threonine: Eliminative deamination, then conversion to pyruvate
    - Glycine: Conversion to serine by the addition of a hydroxymethyl group, then proceed as serine
- Glutamine, Arginine, Histidine, Proline: Are converted into glutamate, which is then deaminated to α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase.
    - Glutamine: Hydrolytic deamination by glutaminase to glutamate
    - Arginine: Cleavage of urea (ornithine is produced), conversion first into glutamate-α-semialdehyde, then into glutamate.
    - Histidine: Deamination and ring opening, conversion to N-formiminoglutamate, transfer of the formimino group to tetrahydrofolate (Cofactor: tetrahydrofolate)
    - Proline: Conversion initially to glutamate-α-semialdehyde, then to glutamate
- Glutamate: Oxidative deamination by glutamate dehydrogenase to α-ketoglutarate
- Methionine and valine: Are converted into succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA.
    - Methionine cycle: During the breakdown of methionine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is formed as an intermediate product, which plays an important role as a cofactor in methylation reactions. Through demethylation, homocysteine is generated from SAM. If a lot of SAM is needed, homocysteine can be regenerated to methionine, which can then be converted back to SAM.
        - Methionine → S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) → S-Adenosylhomocysteine → Homocysteine → Methionine
- Threonine: From glycine and serine to pyruvate or via α-ketobutyrate to succinyl-CoA
- Asparagine: Deamination by asparaginase to aspartate (and this further to oxaloacetate)
- Aspartate: Transamination to oxaloacetate (by aspartate aminotransferase)

> [!NOTE] Homocystinuria
> Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a disturbance in the metabolism of methionine. As a result, both methionine and its breakdown product homocysteine accumulate in the blood and urine. The most common cause is a deficiency of the enzyme cystathionine β-synthase, which is involved in the breakdown of methionine. Affected children are usually asymptomatic at birth. However, in the first months of life, symptoms can arise in the eyes (e.g., lens dislocation, glaucoma), in the skeleton (e.g., disproportionate tall stature), and in the central nervous system (e.g., intellectual disability, epileptic seizures) due to deposits of homocysteine. Additionally, early deposits in the vessels can occur, which may lead to arteriosclerosis, strokes, and heart attacks in early adulthood. There is no causal therapy: if cystathionine β-synthase is still slightly active, the administration of its cofactor pyridoxal phosphate may sometimes help. Otherwise, a methionine-restricted diet is the focus of therapy.

### Breakdown of glucogenic-ketogenic mixed amino acids

- Tyrosine and phenylalanine: Are broken down into fumarate and acetyl-CoA.
    - Tyrosine: Transamination by tyrosine transaminase, then a multi-step conversion to fumarate and acetyl-CoA
    - Phenylalanine: First conversion to Tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase (requires O2 and tetrahydrobiopterin as a reducing agent), then degradation see Tyrosine
        - Alternative pathways for the breakdown of phenylalanine:
            - Transamination to phenylpyruvate and subsequent reduction to phenyllactate
            - Transamination and breakdown to phenylacetylglutamine
            - Degradation to phenylacetate
- Tryptophan: Conversion to Alanine and Acetyl-CoA, during which Nicotinamide is also formed.
- Isoleucine
    - Transamination to Propionyl-CoA and Acetyl-CoA
    - Propionyl-CoA is converted to Succinyl-CoA via Methylmalonyl-CoA.

> [!NOTE] Phenylketonuria
> With a deficiency (or complete absence) of phenylalanine hydroxylase, the breakdown of phenylalanine to tyrosine is blocked. As a result, phenylalanine and its metabolites accumulate in all body fluids, and tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid. This condition is called phenylketonuria. Its testing is part of the newborn screening that is conducted on each infant between the 2nd and 6th day of life. If the condition remains untreated, it leads to severe intellectual disability. The treatment consists of a lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diet.

### Degradation of ketogenic amino acids

Lysine and leucine are broken down into acetyl-CoA.

> [!NOTE] Maple syrup disease
> In maple syrup disease (branched-chain ketoaciduria), the enzyme branched-chain dehydrogenase is missing, which is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of the corresponding branched-chain α-keto acids during the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine). Consequently, the breakdown is disturbed, and the affected amino acids as well as their α-keto acids accumulate in the urine, which then takes on a maple syrup-like odor. If the condition remains untreated, it leads to severe physical and mental disability. The treatment consists of a lifelong diet low in leucine, valine, and isoleucine.

## Urea Cycle

The urea cycle is a liver cell-specific cyclical metabolic pathway in which urea is formed from ammonia and bicarbonate (HCO3−).

- Definition: Cascade of biochemical reactions in which ammonia is converted into urea.
- Goal: Serves in the organism for the excretion of nitrogen
- Origin of ammonia: In various tissues and metabolic pathways, nitrogen is produced in the form of ammonia as a breakdown product.
    - Because ammonia is toxic, it must be present in the body bound to glutamine or alanine for transport.
        - Glutamine cycle (from most tissues): Transport of the amino group in the form of glutamine to the liver
            - The glutamate-ammonium ligase, previously referred to as glutamine synthetase, binds free ammonia in the tissue to glutamate, resulting in the formation of glutamine.
- In liver cells, ammonia is then released through oxidative deamination of glutamate.
        - Alanine cycle (primarily from the muscle): Transport of ammonia in the form of alanine to the liver
            - Is formed in the muscle from pyruvate by ALT and converted back into pyruvate in the liver by ALT.
- Location: Primarily in liver cells (cytosol and mitochondria), to a lesser extent also in the kidneys.
- Energy balance: Consumes 3 ATP
- Key enzyme: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1
    - Regulation: Activated by N-acetylglutamate

> [!NOTE]
> The mitochondrial carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 of the urea cycle must not be confused with the cytosolic carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 2, which is an enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis!

> [!NOTE]
> Carbamoylphosphate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms as well as the carbon atom of the urea molecule formed in the urea cycle. The second nitrogen atom comes from a molecule of aspartate!

> [!NOTE] Hepatic Encephalopathy
> In cases of liver cell damage (e.g., due to liver cirrhosis), as well as in congenital defects of the enzymes of the urea cycle, there is an increase in ammonia in the blood (so-called hyperammonemia). Typical consequences include neurological symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, mood swings, sleep disturbances, and hand tremors. Functional impairments of the central nervous system due to the liver's insufficient detoxification function are referred to as "hepatic encephalopathy." In its most severe form, this can lead to coma, which is then referred to as "hepatic coma."

> [!NOTE] Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency (OTC Deficiency)
> The most common disorder of the urea cycle is the X-linked inherited defect of ornithine transcarbamylase. Clinically, this presents within the first days after birth with lethargy, tachypnea, epileptic seizures, and hypothermia. Laboratory tests reveal an increase in ammonia and a decrease in citrulline in the blood, among other findings. In the urine, orotate is elevated, a byproduct of pyrimidine synthesis. The precursor for its formation is carbamoyl phosphate, which accumulates in excess due to OTC deficiency.

## Amino Acid Synthesis

The human organism has the enzymatic capacity to synthesize all non-essential amino acids.

### Synthesis of Non-Essential Amino Acids

The synthesis of non-essential amino acids occurs in a manner similar to their reverse degradation and mainly takes place in the liver. The carbon skeleton is derived from the citric acid cycle or carbohydrate metabolism, while the amino group is provided through transamination of glutamate.

#### Amino Acids as Neurotransmitters or Their Precursors

The proteinogenic amino acids glutamate, glycine, and aspartate are themselves neurotransmitters. Glutamate, as well as tyrosine and tryptophan, also serve as precursors in the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The following list provides an overview of the metabolic pathways of some important neurotransmitters.

- GABA (γ-Aminobutyric acid)
    - Synthesis: From glutamic acid (glutamate) in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylation.
        - Enzyme: Glutamate decarboxylase
    - Breakdown: In the so-called GABA shunt, GABA is oxidized to succinate.
- Histamine
    - Synthesis: From histidine in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reaction
        - Enzyme: Histidine decarboxylase
    - Degradation: To Imidazoleacetate
        - Enzyme: Diamine oxidase
- NO (Nitric oxide)
    - Synthesis: From arginine in two NADPH+H+-dependent steps using molecular oxygen (O2)
        - Enzyme: Neuronal NO Synthase (nNOS)
- Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)
    - Synthesis: From Tryptophan in a two-step reaction
        - Step 1: Tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hydroxylation
            - Reaction: Tryptophan + Tetrahydrobiopterin + O2 → 5-Hydroxytryptophan + Dihydrobiopterin
                - Enzyme: Tryptophan hydroxylase
        - Step 2: Pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylation
            - Reaction: 5-Hydroxytryptophan → Serotonin + CO2
            - Enzyme: 5-Hydroxytryptophan Decarboxylase
    - Degradation: To 5-Hydroxyindole-Acetic Acid
- Tyrosine: See: Catecholamine biosynthesis

> [!NOTE] Tumor marker in carcinoid
> 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid is a breakdown product of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). Carcinoid tumors of the enterochromaffin cells produce increased amounts of serotonin, which is why an elevated amount of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is excreted in urine. The determination of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in 24-hour collected urine is thus an important method in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids).

## Review Questions on the Chapter Amino Acid Metabolism
### Amino Acid Degradation

How does the breakdown of amino acids generally occur?
- The general principle of amino acid degradation is the same for all reaction pathways: Firstly, either the amino group (through transamination and deamination) or the carboxyl group (through decarboxylation) is cleaved off. Subsequently, the remaining carbon skeleton is further utilized in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism as well as in the citric acid cycle.

Describe the process of transamination of amino acids, including the involved enzymes and the prosthetic group, and provide an example reaction!
- Transamination of amino acids serves to transfer an amino group from the amino acid to an α-keto acid. This reaction is catalyzed by aminotransferases (= transaminases), e.g., AST and ALT. The most important coenzyme in amino acid degradation is PALP (pyridoxal phosphate); in an intermediate step of the reaction, the amino acids are covalently bound to PALP. Example of a transamination: Aspartate + α-ketoglutarate ⇄ Oxaloacetate + Glutamate (catalyzed by AST).

### Further Utilization of the Carbon Skeleton of Amino Acids

What three different types can amino acids be classified into based on their degradation pathways?
- Depending on the degradation pathway of their carbon skeleton, amino acids are classified as glucogenic, ketogenic, or mixed glucogenic/ketogenic.

Describe the utilization of the carbon skeleton of amino acids briefly and name the two purely ketogenic amino acids!
- The carbon skeleton of glucogenic amino acids is either funneled into pyruvate and enters gluconeogenesis or converted into substrates of the citric acid cycle. Ketogenic amino acids (lysine, leucine) are converted into acetyl-CoA, which then directly enters the citric acid cycle or is used for the synthesis of ketone bodies, fatty acids, or cholesterol. Mixed glucogenic/ketogenic amino acids are converted into acetyl-CoA and glucogenic degradation products.

What is meant by the so-called methionine cycle?
- During the degradation of the glucogenic amino acid methionine, the intermediate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is formed, which is an important cofactor in methylation reactions. Demethylation converts SAM into homocysteine. If much SAM is needed, homocysteine can be regenerated to methionine, which is then again converted into SAM. This reaction chain from methionine → S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) → S-adenosylhomocysteine → homocysteine → methionine is referred to as the methionine cycle.

Describe the pathogenesis of maple syrup disease and phenylketonuria!
- Phenylketonuria arises due to defective degradation of the mixed glucogenic/ketogenic amino acid phenylalanine. Normally, it is first converted by phenylalanine hydroxylase (O2-dependent and with tetrahydrobiopterin as reducing agent) to tyrosine and then further degraded. In case of deficiency (or complete absence) of phenylalanine hydroxylase, the conversion to tyrosine cannot take place, leading to accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in body fluids. In maple syrup urine disease (branched-chain ketoaciduria), degradation of the branched-chain amino acids leucine, valine, and isoleucine is impaired due to absence of the branched-chain dehydrogenase enzyme.

### Urea Cycle

Where does the urea cycle take place and what is its purpose? Describe the consequences of a disturbed urea cycle!
- The urea cycle is a liver cell-specific cyclic metabolic pathway in which nontoxic urea is formed from bicarbonate (HCO3−) and the toxic degradation product ammonia. It serves to excrete nitrogen. In liver cell damage (e.g., due to liver cirrhosis) or congenital defects of the enzymes of the urea cycle, ammonia levels in the blood increase (so-called hyperammonemia), impairing CNS function. Neurological symptoms due to impaired detoxification by the liver are termed "hepatic encephalopathy"; in its most severe form, it can result in hepatic coma.

What is meant by the glutamine cycle?
- The glutamine cycle serves the transport of ammonia within the body. Free ammonia in tissues is bound to glutamate by glutamine synthetase, forming glutamine. In liver cells, ammonia is released again by oxidative deamination, regenerating glutamate.

Describe the reaction steps of the urea cycle including location and enzymes!
- During degradation of amino acids from diet or endogenous proteins, amino groups are cleaved off. These are transported to the liver and there, together with bicarbonate, converted into carbamoyl phosphate in the first reaction step of the urea cycle (enzyme: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1). Subsequently, citrulline is formed from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine (enzyme: ornithine carbamoyltransferase). In the third step, argininosuccinate is formed from citrulline and aspartate (enzyme: argininosuccinate synthetase). This is then cleaved into arginine and fumarate (enzyme: argininosuccinate lyase). In the fifth and final step, hydrolysis of arginine produces urea and ornithine (enzyme: arginase). The first two reactions take place in the mitochondrion, all subsequent ones in the cytosol of hepatocytes.

What is the rate-limiting step of the urea cycle and how is the energy required for it provided?
- The rate-limiting reaction of the urea cycle is the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from HCO3− and NH3. It requires the conversion of 2 ATP → 2 ADP + phosphate.

How are the substrates of the urea cycle transported across the mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol?
- In the urea cycle, citrulline is transported from the mitochondrion into the cytosol in exchange for ornithine via the so-called citrulline-ornithine antiport.

Which atoms does carbamoyl phosphate provide for the urea molecule formed in the urea cycle?
- Carbamoyl phosphate serves in urea synthesis as the donor of one of the two nitrogen atoms as well as the carbon atom of the urea molecule.

### Amino Acid Synthesis

Describe the synthesis of the non-essential amino acids glutamine and glycine!
- Glutamine is formed from glutamate by ATP-dependent attachment of an amino group from ammonia. Glycine is formed by PALP-dependent demethylation of serine: Serine + THF ⇄ Glycine + N5,N10-Methylene-THF + H2O.

### Metabolic Products of Amino Acids

How is GABA produced?
- The neurotransmitter GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is produced from glutamate in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylation catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase.

How is histamine produced?
- Histamine is produced from histidine in a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent reaction.

How is serotonin produced?
- Serotonin is produced from tryptophan in a two-step reaction. The first step is a tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hydroxylation (reaction: tryptophan + tetrahydrobiopterin + O2 → 5-hydroxytryptophan + dihydrobiopterin). The second step is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylation.

What can the breakdown product of serotonin be used as a marker for?
- Carcinoid tumors of enterochromaffin cells produce increased serotonin; therefore, an elevated amount of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the breakdown product of serotonin) is excreted in the urine.

From which amino acid is melatonin derived?
- Melatonin is formed from tryptophan.
